          <p>A major federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated following the discovery of envelopes containing a suspicious white powder. The New York City Fire Department's hazmat unit responded to the scene to investigate the substance found on the ninth floor. Mayor Eric Adams confirmed he was briefed on the situation and reassured the public that there were no known injuries at the time. The investigation is ongoing, and officials have asked the public to avoid the area while federal partners conduct tests on the powder.</p>

As part of the partnership, Barbie's parent company Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union to increase girls' access to the sport.

          <p>President Trump has federalized the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington D.C. and deployed National Guard troops to address crime, a move that will be overseen by Attorney General Pam Bondi. As part of the new federal authority, D.C. police have been directed to share information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following traffic stops involving undocumented immigrants. The administration praised the directive as a positive step toward reducing crime and signaled that similar policies could be implemented in other cities.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the stock market despite signs of "froth," such as the explosive gains of some recent IPOs and speculative companies. He argues that the current market is different from the dot-com bubble because there are enough rational, strong companies to balance out the irrational exuberance. Cramer pointed to substantive positive developments at companies like Amazon, which recently launched a disruptive same-day fresh food delivery service, and Eli Lilly as examples of legitimate market strength. He suggests that while some speculative rallies exist, they shouldn't deter investment in fundamentally sound businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Coastal Commission has unanimously voted against SpaceX's proposal to nearly double its annual rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base to 95. Commissioners cited significant concerns about the environmental impact of sonic booms on residents, wildlife, and property, as well as inadequate monitoring and mitigation plans. The vote highlights a jurisdictional conflict, as SpaceX and the military argue the launches are federal activities exempt from state permits. The commission's objection does not halt the expansion but signals growing friction between the state and Elon Musk's company over its rapidly increasing launch schedule.</p>

Past summits, such as the 2018 meeting in Helsinki, were marked by Trump's tendency to value personal rapport and Putin's calculated use of gestures and lengthy monologues to control the narrative. Former officials note Putin's meticulous preparation, contrasting it with Trump's more spontaneous approach. This history suggests Putin may attempt to manipulate the dynamic, leveraging his experience to secure advantages for Russia in any potential negotiations.</p>

          <p>Ford is undertaking a major overhaul of its manufacturing process to compete with the growing threat of affordable, high-tech electric vehicles from China. The company announced plans to produce a new $30,000 electric pickup truck by 2027, built on a redesigned assembly line that uses 20% fewer parts and a more efficient "assembly tree" system. This strategic shift, led by former Tesla and Apple engineers, is an admission that its current method of adapting gas-powered models for EVs is too costly and inefficient. Ford's CEO views this competition with Chinese automakers as an existential challenge for the company's future.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has agreed to a club-record deal worth up to £42.5 million to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth. The 23-year-old Burkina Faso international is scheduled for a medical in London after expressing a desire to leave his current club, where he felt he did not have a prominent role. Ouattara had a productive season last year, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances for Bournemouth. The move comes after Brentford had a previous £35 million bid for another winger, Omari Hutchinson, rejected by Ipswich earlier in the transfer window.</p>

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency, the virus continues to spread rapidly in Africa, with outbreaks now present in 24 countries. A new, more transmissible strain that emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been a primary driver of the spread. Despite the alarm, critics argue the global response has been dangerously inadequate, hampered by cuts to foreign aid and a slow rollout of vaccines, with only a fraction of pledged doses delivered to the continent. Experts warn that the uncontrolled spread allows the virus to become further entrenched in human populations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, plummeted nearly 16% after announcing that increased tariffs will negatively affect its profits in the upcoming fiscal year. The company projects that new duties, along with the end of the de minimis rule for duty-free imports, will cost it approximately $160 million. This led to a full-year earnings forecast that fell short of Wall Street expectations, even as the company anticipates low single-digit revenue growth. The announcement highlights the significant financial pressure that retailers are facing due to recent changes in U.S. trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty have mutually agreed to end their partnership, which placed Ulta shops inside hundreds of Target stores, by August 2026. The collaboration, launched in 2021, was initially touted as a key strategy to drive traffic and boost Target's growing beauty category. The dissolution of the deal could present a challenge for Target, which has faced declining store traffic and sales recently. An analyst suggested that issues with in-store operations and staffing at Target may have contributed to the decision, adding another hurdle for the retailer as it navigates a difficult market environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a campaign for a special election on November 4 to approve newly drawn congressional districts. This move is a direct response to Republican-led efforts in states like Texas, which are redrawing maps at President Trump's request to secure a House majority. Newsom argues that California must "meet fire with fire" to prevent Republicans from rigging the 2026 midterm elections and to protect democracy. If approved by voters, the new map would temporarily override the state's independent redistricting commission and could significantly increase the number of Democratic seats from California.</p>

          <p>A coalition of prominent religious leaders in Washington, D.C., has issued a strong condemnation of President Trump's decision to federalize the city's police force. They criticized the president's rhetoric describing the city as a "lawless wasteland" as dehumanizing and counterproductive to achieving public safety. In a joint statement, the clergy argued that true safety comes from long-term community collaboration and addressing root causes of crime, not from fear-based governance or a military presence. They called on political leaders to reject these tactics and work together with dignity and respect for all residents.</p>

After failing to secure a breakthrough in the NFL, the winger has opted to return to rugby union. Rees-Zammit is a world-class player with 14 tries in 32 appearances for Wales, and his return is seen as a major acquisition for the Premiership club.</p>

          <p>On its 90th anniversary, the Social Security program faces a significant financial challenge, with its trust funds projected to be depleted by 2034, potentially leading to a benefit cut of around 20% for millions of Americans. Lawmakers are considering various proposals to address the looming shortfall and ensure the program's long-term viability for future retirees. One bipartisan plan suggests creating a new $1.5 trillion investment fund, while another proposal focuses on increasing payroll taxes for high-income earners to fund and enhance benefits.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that while retirees can own multiple annuities, the strategy requires careful planning to be effective. Using different types of annuities, such as fixed and variable, can help balance guaranteed income with growth potential and diversify risk across different insurance companies. However, this approach increases complexity, fees, and paperwork. Key considerations include coordinating liquidity by staggering surrender periods, managing different contract terms, and navigating nuanced tax implications for each annuity. The strategy is generally best suited for those with substantial assets who can manage the added complexity to achieve specific retirement goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Under the new advice, individuals with systolic blood pressure in the 130-139 range should first be treated with lifestyle changes, followed by medication if levels do not decrease. A significant change from previous recommendations is the suggestion to abstain from alcohol entirely, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure.

This article characterizes the Trump administration's diplomacy as naive and ill-prepared, highlighting a fundamental misunderstanding of Putin's strategic goal, which is not merely territory but the negation of Ukraine's sovereignty.
