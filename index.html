          <p>The U.S. Senate is set to vote on measures to end a six-day federal government shutdown. Democrats are backing a bill to continue appropriations, which includes an extension of healthcare provisions, while Republicans support a seven-week stopgap measure already passed by the House. Both parties have continued to blame each other for the impasse, with leaders from each side using social media to accuse the other of refusing to compromise. The ongoing political stalemate leaves the timeline for reopening the government uncertain as legislative action continues.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has resigned just 26 days after his appointment, citing a lack of willingness among political parties to compromise. His resignation followed widespread criticism of his new cabinet, which was largely unchanged from the previous government. The move intensifies France's political instability, which has been ongoing since the 2024 snap elections resulted in a hung parliament. Opposition leaders are now calling for early elections and for President Emmanuel Macron to step down.</p>

          <p>Consumer group Which? has initiated a £480 million legal case against U.S. tech giant Qualcomm at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal. The lawsuit alleges that Qualcomm engaged in anti-competitive practices by overcharging Apple and Samsung for essential smartphone components, which inflated costs for consumers. If successful, approximately 29 million UK customers who purchased certain Apple or Samsung phones between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout of around £17 each. The trial is expected to last five weeks, but a final resolution could take years.</p>

          <p>CBS News' new owner, Skydance Media, plans to appoint Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief in a move aimed at appealing to right-of-center audiences. As part of the deal, Skydance is also acquiring The Free Press, the news site Weiss founded after her high-profile resignation from The New York Times. Weiss is expected to redefine the network's brand, though she will partner with current president Tom Cibrowski on day-to-day operations.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has issued $50 million in grants for autism research, including a $5.1 million grant to Cornell University, to better understand treatment outcomes. This funding arrives as the Trump administration faces criticism for promoting unproven theories about the causes of autism, such as links to vaccines and Tylenol. Despite concerns about political influence, autism research experts are cautiously optimistic about the grants, noting the sophisticated and promising approaches of the funded projects. The research aims to bring rigorous scientific validation to a complex and often misunderstood condition.</p>

          <p>A number of bipartisan lawmakers are publicly stating they will reject their salaries as the federal government shutdown extends into its sixth day. Members of Congress from both parties have formally requested that their pay be withheld until the funding crisis is resolved.

While some lawmakers plan to donate their salaries, the gestures highlight the growing political pressure to end the ongoing budget impasse.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Australia are appealing the sentence given to Erin Patterson, who was convicted of murdering three relatives with a poisonous mushroom meal. Patterson was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum non-parole period of 33 years, but the Department of Public Prosecutions argues this is "manifestly inadequate." Meanwhile, Patterson's legal team has indicated she intends to appeal her conviction. The judge's decision to allow for parole was influenced by the harsh prison conditions she faces, including extended periods in solitary confinement for her own safety.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing 528 mammal species reveals that females live longer than males in 72% of species, a trend that extends to humans. Researchers attribute this longevity gap to a combination of genetics, such as females' two X chromosomes, and behavioral factors. In many species, including humans, males tend to engage in riskier behaviors, which can shorten lifespans. The study also found a correlation between caregiving and longer life, suggesting that changing social norms and promoting preventive healthcare among men could help narrow the gap.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deploy National Guard troops from California and Texas to Portland, Oregon. The ruling follows a previous decision that barred the federalization of Oregon's own National Guard for the same purpose. Judge Karin Immergut stated there was no evidence that recent protests necessitated such a military presence, arguing it would risk state sovereignty and inflame tensions.

He asserted that the incidents should make European citizens "fear and tremble," potentially turning them against leaders who he claims are stoking conflict for political and financial gain. His remarks continue his pattern of hawkish, anti-Western rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged over 4% to a record high after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's next prime minister. The market rally was driven by investor optimism that Takaichi will maintain an accommodative monetary policy and pursue economic expansion. In response to the political shift, the Japanese yen weakened significantly, falling past the 150 mark against the U.S. dollar, raising concerns about potential government intervention to stabilize the currency.

          <p>An analysis of the NFL season after Week 5 highlights several teams whose performances have been particularly disappointing, separate from just being the worst in the league. The winless New York Jets (0-5) top the list due to devastating losses, poor execution, and a historic lack of defensive takeaways. The Baltimore Ravens (1-4) are also featured for their historically bad home loss and injury-plagued defense. Other teams noted for their underperformance and evaporating good vibes include the Cincinnati Bengals, Las Vegas Raiders, and even the 4-1 Philadelphia Eagles, who are facing internal and fan criticism.</p>

          <p>Both Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers are encountering significant obstacles in securing international distribution for their work, even for award-winning films. The Oscar-winning Palestinian documentary "No Other Land" failed to find a U.S. distributor, forcing a self-release, while other acclaimed films face similar challenges in politically polarized markets. Israeli filmmakers also report increased difficulty in obtaining co-production financing and international sales. The trend reflects a growing reluctance from distributors to handle films from the region due to the contentious political climate and fear of backlash.</p>

          <p>A group of 176 Zambian farmers has filed a lawsuit against two local subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned mining companies, alleging an "ecological catastrophe." The suit claims that a tailings dam collapse in February released acidic waste that contaminated local water sources and farmland, destroying livelihoods and causing health problems. The legal action presents a dilemma for the Zambian government, which maintains strong economic ties with China, a major funder of the nation's infrastructure projects. The petitioners argue the spill violated their constitutional rights and that they were not properly warned of the danger.</p>

          <p>Police in Western Australia have seized 135 firearms and revoked or suspended 44 gun licenses from individuals identified as holding "sovereign citizen" ideologies, which reject government authority.

Officials used strengthened gun laws to target owners who, by expressing that they do not abide by state laws, were deemed not to be a "fit and proper person" to hold a permit.

          <p>Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare condition affecting the brain and spinal nerves, leading to muscle weakening and eventual loss of function. While the exact cause is unknown, it is likely a mix of genetic and environmental factors, with a lifetime risk of about one in 300. There is no cure, but emerging treatments offer hope for slowing its progression. Several studies have suggested a correlation between elite contact sports and a higher risk of developing MND, though a direct causal link has not been proven, sparking ongoing research and debate.</p>

The collapse occurred last week at the Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school while students, mostly teenage boys, were gathered for afternoon prayers. Rescue efforts are ongoing, with excavators clearing debris to search for more victims in what is now Indonesia's deadliest single-building disaster of the year.

The MoD states the policy aims to minimize educational disruption for frequently moving service families. The practice has drawn criticism from Plaid Cymru, who called it an "insult to our language," while the Conservatives defended it as a matter of parental choice.</p>
