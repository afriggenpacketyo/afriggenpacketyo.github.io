          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts publicly defended the independence of the judiciary, cautioning against the impeachment of judges due to disagreements with their rulings. Speaking at an event in Buffalo, his hometown, Roberts emphasized that impeachment is not the proper way to register disagreement with judicial decisions. His remarks follow similar comments by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who denounced attacks on judges and harassment that undermine the Constitution. Roberts's defense of judicial independence comes amid scrutiny of federal judges and pressure on the Supreme Court, particularly in cases challenging the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States, under President Trump's policies, is mirroring the errors of past empires, such as Rome, by undermining international norms and fostering internal division. The article contends that Trump's tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, and embrace of nationalism are eroding Western economic and security dominance. It suggests that these actions are accelerating a loss of faith in the Western project, drawing parallels to historical instances where leaders' hubris and short-sightedness led to irreversible decline. The author urges the US to take heed and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>

          <p>The federal government released over 60,000 pages of records related to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, ordered by President Trump with support from RFK Jr. The documents include FBI investigation details and interviews with Sirhan Sirhan and eyewitnesses.

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), a mainland China-listed firm, is preparing for a significant share offering in Hong Kong, potentially the city's largest IPO of the year. This move reflects a growing trend of A-share companies seeking listings in Hong Kong, attracted by favorable valuations, strong liquidity, and supportive regulatory policies. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is streamlining the overseas listing process, further enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The regulatory support is expected to fuel the A-to-H listing trend.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has claimed it deployed Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets against India's air force during a recent military encounter, asserting the aircraft shot down Indian warplanes. Pakistani officials stated that the J-10C jets were responsible for downing multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafale fighter jets. If confirmed, this would mark the first known air-to-air combat kill for the Chinese fighter jet and the first combat loss of a Rafale aircraft. India has yet to comment on the claim.</p>
