          <p>President Trump addressed the timing of his decision regarding sanctions on Russia, stating that the deadline is "in my brain." He compared the Russia-Ukraine war to two boys fighting in a park, questioning whether it's best to break them up or let them fight. Trump also mentioned his phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, indicating ongoing discussions regarding the conflict and potential actions. The President's comments suggest a cautious approach to sanctions, weighing the potential impact on both countries. Optimism for this situation is low given the war, but there is stability in that Trump has an idea of what to do.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court blocked Mexico‚Äôs suit against U.S. gun makers, focusing on whether the Mexican government could sue U.S. manufacturers over claims that they shared blame for violence by drug cartels. The case centered on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005, which generally shields gun manufacturers from liability. The Supreme Court's decision effectively ends Mexico's legal effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for the flow of weapons into Mexico. The ruling is a setback for Mexico's efforts to combat cartel violence.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its popular V-8 Hemi engine for its Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a decision to discontinue it amid tightening fuel economy regulations. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted the decision to cancel the Hemi was a mistake. The return of the Hemi is part of a new product turnaround plan that includes 25 product announcements over an 18-month period. The decision reflects a shift in automakers' plans, as EV adoption has been slower than expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kash Patel, a longtime critic of the FBI, is now the director of the agency and is beginning to implement changes. He and his deputy, Dan Bongino, are redeploying agents and analysts out of Washington, D.C., to field offices and shifting the FBI from traditional law enforcement to immigration enforcement. Senior FBI agents have been pushed out, depriving the agency of experience. Patel has also disbanded the premier public corruption squad, which investigates public officials.</p>
