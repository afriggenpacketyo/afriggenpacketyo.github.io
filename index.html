          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech in San Francisco criticizing the Trump administration's policies, particularly his trade war, which she described as a man-made economic crisis. Harris accused the administration of abandoning American ideals and instilling fear, while also addressing immigration concerns. She highlighted the courage of judges upholding the law and called on Americans to stand together, emphasizing that the country belongs to its people. The speech did not include an announcement of a run for California governor, though she is considered a potential candidate. The article notes Harris's increased public presence since the election.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amidst concerns over President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the Japanese economy. While inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for an extended period, allowing room for rate increases, the central bank acknowledged that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to global economic slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. The BOJ expects inflation to remain between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025 and 1.5-2% in fiscal year 2026, while also monitoring trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has significantly lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the global economy and domestic corporate profits. The BOJ now expects the Japanese economy to grow by only 0.5%, a sharp decrease from its previous forecast of 1.1%. This decision reflects concerns that tariffs are disrupting economic recovery and complicating the BOJ's efforts to normalize monetary policy, potentially leading to a decline in prices and hindering overall economic stability.</p>

          <p>Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, reported that Chinese online retailers have reduced their advertising spending on Facebook and Instagram, citing President Trump's trade policies and the end of de minimis trade exemptions.

          <p>Ray Dalio warned of a decline in U.S. economic dominance, suggesting that the global order is shifting away from American influence, but Elon Musk challenged Dalio's claim that the U.S. remains the world's primary consumer. Musk asserted that China has surpassed the U.S. as the leading consumer of manufactured goods, particularly in the automotive industry. Dalio's warning rests on the idea that the U.S. is still the main consumer and debtor at the center of global economic gravity—but Musk's data point upends that. This difference in perspective highlights a debate over the current economic power balance between the two nations.</p>

As Japan aims for net-zero emissions by 2050, LNG is expected to play a crucial role in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, due to its lower carbon emissions compared to other fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>A Maryland judge has criticized the Trump administration for its handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Xinis has ordered the government to provide information and has accused them of acting in bad faith. Senator Chris Van Hollen has also spoken out against the administration's actions, arguing that they threaten the constitutional rights of all Americans. The Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia is an El Salvador citizen and has accused him of being a member of the MS-13 gang, allegations his lawyers deny.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly hesitant to engage in serious trade talks with the United States due to internal divisions within the Trump administration regarding trade policy. With conflicting views among Trump's top advisers, Beijing is waiting to see which faction will gain influence and how other countries will respond to the temporary pause on tariffs. This uncertainty makes China reluctant to reveal its negotiating position until a clear direction from the U.S. emerges, as there are divergent views on how to deal with China.</p>

Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson expressed concerns that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the separation between church and state.
