          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump is now open to meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, even if a separate meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy does not occur. This marks a shift from a previous stance that suggested a trilateral meeting was preferred to address the ongoing war in Ukraine. Kremlin officials have claimed that a bilateral summit between Trump and Putin has already been agreed upon and is in the planning stages, a detail the White House is still working to confirm. Zelenskyy has maintained that Ukraine and Europe must be included in any substantive peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, describing him as "highly conflicted" in a post on Truth Social. The demand followed a letter from Senator Tom Cotton, which raised concerns about Tan's investment ties to numerous Chinese companies, including some allegedly linked to the Chinese military. The senator's letter also referenced a prior case where a company led by Tan pleaded guilty to illegally exporting technology to China. Intel's stock price declined following the president's statement, and the company has not yet issued a public response.</p>

After restricting the Fire to a manageable total of 143-9, the Superchargers' chase was powered by a strong opening partnership between Crawley and Dawid Malan. Despite a couple of dropped catches by the Fire, Crawley capitalized on the opportunities to secure his highest score in the tournament on his team debut.

Miran, who requires Senate confirmation, is a known critic of past Fed policies and has advocated for controversial economic strategies. His appointment is seen as a move to install a dissenting voice on the board to pressure for lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers in Texas have left the state in an effort to block a special legislative session aimed at passing a new congressional map. The proposed map, pushed by Republicans at the behest of President Trump, is designed to create five additional GOP seats in the U.S. House. By leaving Texas, the Democrats deny the legislature the quorum needed to vote, a tactic they have used in the past. In response, Republican state leaders have threatened the absent lawmakers with arrest, escalating the situation into a national showdown over redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing all further construction at the controversial immigrant detention center in Florida known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was being built without required environmental impact studies, threatening the sensitive Everglades ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees for now, the 14-day halt on construction prevents immediate further harm to the area.

The unanimous decision sends the case back to an appeals court, which had previously dismissed it by arguing that courts must defer to the Public Utilities Commission's expertise. The groups contend that the commission violated state law in 2022 when it drastically reduced the credits solar panel owners receive for sending excess power to the grid.

          <p>Shares of rocket and lunar lander manufacturer Firefly Aerospace soared more than 30% in their Nasdaq debut, achieving a valuation of approximately $8.5 billion. The company priced its shares above the expected range, raising $868 million in a sign of strong investor interest in the space technology sector. Firefly has secured key customers like Lockheed Martin and a recent $177 million contract from NASA, and its successful Blue Ghost lunar landing has boosted its profile. The strong IPO performance reflects a warming market for tech debuts and growing momentum for private space exploration companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at increasing the inclusion of alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies, in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs the Department of Labor to review and clarify guidance for plan fiduciaries regarding these non-traditional investments. While advocates argue this could offer investors greater diversification and higher returns, some financial advisors express concern about the associated risks, high fees, and lack of transparency for less sophisticated investors. The move is considered a significant victory for the alternative asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again raised the possibility of a federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s government, citing crime and mismanagement as justification. However, the president does not have the unilateral authority to federalize the city; doing so would require an act of Congress to overturn the 1973 Home Rule Act. While Trump can command the D.C. National Guard and potentially take temporary control of the city's police in an emergency, a full takeover is legally complex and unlikely. The threat comes despite D.C. police data showing that violent crime in the city has been declining for the past year and a half.</p>

An ICE official confirmed Cain will be sworn in as an honorary officer.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is denying early retirement requests from all transgender service members with 15 to 18 years of service, according to an internal memo. This decision forces these long-serving individuals to either resign or be discharged without retirement benefits, receiving only a lump-sum payment. The move aligns with the Trump administration's broader policy to bar transgender people from serving in the military, which the Pentagon justifies by deeming them medically unfit. Advocacy groups have called the decision a betrayal, as some service members had already received early retirement approvals that were subsequently rescinded.</p>

          <p>The new film "Freakier Friday" reunites Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan for a sequel to their 2003 body-swap comedy, this time involving a four-way switch with their respective daughter and step-daughter. The review notes that while the chemistry between the original stars remains the film's biggest charm, the plot itself is thinly sketched and primarily serves as a vehicle for their reunion. The performances of Curtis and Lohan are praised for holding the screen with confidence, but the overall story lacks the emotional insight of the original. The film is described as a disposable but delightful experience for fans, filled with comedic cameos.</p>

While captain Bruno Fernandes is expected to play a deeper role, his natural tendencies are more offensive. The article analyzes the current midfield options, including Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro, and concludes that a new signing may be necessary to provide the needed energy and defensive stability.</p>
