          <p>Defense company stocks in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. experienced a rally following a significant policy shift from President Donald Trump. In a statement, Trump expressed confidence that Ukraine could win back all of its territory from Russia, citing Moscow's economic troubles. This marks a major departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to concede territory for peace. The comments, which also included a call for NATO to shoot down Russian jets violating its airspace, were seen by industry leaders as a reaffirmation of the ongoing security challenges posed by Russia.

          <p>A comprehensive report has revealed that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) engaged in unlawful surveillance practices against journalists between 2011 and 2024. The investigation, led by lawyer Angus McCullough KC, found 21 instances of illegal attempts to uncover reporters' sources, double the number previously admitted. Furthermore, the PSNI systematically checked journalists' phone numbers, obtained from its press office, against police systems to detect unauthorized contact with officers in what were termed "defensive operations" against leaks. The report deemed this practice disproportionate and raised significant data protection concerns.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal of his previous stance, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine is capable of winning back all its territory from Russia. Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump posted on social media that Kyiv could reclaim its original borders, citing Russia's economic difficulties and labeling the nation a "paper tiger." This new position contrasts sharply with his earlier suggestions that Ukraine would likely need to cede land for a peace agreement. Zelensky praised the development as a "big shift" and a positive signal of U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Returning to his show after a brief suspension by Disney, late-night host Jimmy Kimmel delivered a defiant monologue addressing the controversy over his recent comments. While expressing regret that his words were perceived as making light of a tragedy, he did not apologize and instead intensified his criticism of President Donald Trump. Kimmel framed the issue as a defense of free speech against government threats, stating that the president's attempts to silence him were "anti-American."

          <p>In a significant ruling for the trial of Soldier F, a judge has determined that witness statements given by other soldiers in 1972 can be used as evidence. Soldier F, a former paratrooper, is accused of two murders and five attempted murders during the Bloody Sunday massacre in Londonderry. The prosecution argued that the statements from two fellow soldiers, one deceased and one unwilling to testify, are the only evidence capable of proving Soldier F fired at civilians. The defense had challenged the reliability of these decades-old statements, but the judge allowed their submission, moving the historic trial forward.</p>

          <p>A number of influential podcasters and content creators, who were instrumental in building support for Donald Trump, are now showing signs of disillusionment with his second term. While some hosts remain loyal, prominent figures like Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Andrew Schulz have grown more critical of the administration's policies on issues like tariffs, government transparency, and foreign policy. This shift within the so-called "manosphere" could present a challenge for the MAGA movement, as these hosts command large audiences of young, male voters. The article suggests this fragmentation reflects a potential weakening of the unconventional coalition that helped Trump win reelection.</p>

Shaw, who was friends with Kirk, defended his decision, stating that their connection was through their shared Christian faith and that he felt it was important to be there.

In contrast, the author notes, Trump used the platform to reiterate messages of hate and retribution against his political opponents, explicitly stating, "I hate my opponent." The piece argues that Trump's rhetoric of incitement stands in stark opposition to the role of a uniter and comforter in chief during a national tragedy.</p>

Sanders contends that this extreme inequality is undermining democracy and pushing the country towards an oligarchy.

          <p>Chris Francis, a custom shoemaker in East Los Angeles, has become the custodian of a massive archive from Pasquale Di Fabrizio, the legendary "shoemaker to the stars." The collection contains the shoe lasts, patterns, and foot tracings of thousands of celebrities from the 1960s to the 2000s, including Frank Sinatra, Anjelica Huston, and Liza Minnelli. Francis acquired the archive, which was stored in thousands of shoe boxes, and is now working to preserve the legacy of Di Fabrizio and the history of handmade shoemaking in Los Angeles. He hopes to eventually find a public space to share this unique collection of Hollywood history.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while society has rightly focused on advancing opportunities for girls and women, a significant and often ignored crisis is affecting boys and men. The author points to widening gender gaps in education, where women now earn nearly 60% of college degrees, and severe disparities in health outcomes, with men facing higher rates of suicide and drug overdoses. The article calls for a more balanced approach, urging leaders to address the systemic issues failing boys, from educational methods to the lack of federal offices for men's health. It suggests that true equality requires supporting both sexes.</p>

          <p>A California woman was swindled out of her life savings and tricked into selling her home by a scammer using artificial intelligence to impersonate a soap opera actor. The fraudster cultivated a romantic relationship with the victim, using deepfake videos to profess his love and convince her to send tens of thousands of dollars for supposed shared expenses. This type of romance scam, where criminals use AI to clone celebrities' voices and likenesses, is becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Experts warn consumers to be highly skeptical of unsolicited contact from famous individuals online, as the technology makes such impersonations alarmingly convincing.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 70-year-old man who spent 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit, has accepted a $25 million settlement from the city of Inglewood, California. Hastings was declared factually innocent in 2023 after long-ignored DNA evidence was finally tested, identifying the true perpetrator who died in 2020. His lawsuit alleged that Inglewood police detectives fabricated evidence and ignored witness descriptions that pointed away from him. While stating that no amount of money can restore his lost years, Hastings expressed that the settlement marks a welcome end to his long ordeal.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has ordered an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments following a BBC investigation. The report found instances of asylum seekers being taken on long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment reportedly costing £600. While asylum seekers receive a weekly bus pass, taxis are booked for other necessary travel without public transport being presented as an option. The practice has drawn criticism for its high cost at a time when public services are strained.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bangkok are responding to a large sinkhole that emerged after a 50-meter section of a busy road collapsed. The incident occurred in a residential neighborhood near major hospitals, prompting the evacuation of nearby residents and workers. Officials believe heavy rain likely eroded a large underground water pipe, causing the initial collapse, which was then exacerbated by sliding dirt from a nearby subway construction project. Footage showed the hole slowly expanding as more of the road gave way. Fortunately, no deaths or injuries were reported, but the area remains dangerous as crews work to stabilize the ground.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a TikTok ad for Au Vodka featuring former "Love Island" contestant Lucinda Strafford. The regulator ruled that the ad, which showed Strafford promoting the alcoholic beverage, was inappropriately directed at people under 18. The ASA cited the popularity of "Love Island" among young people and argued that insufficient care was taken to prevent the ad from reaching an underage audience on the platform. The ruling is part of a broader crackdown by the ASA, which also banned two other Au Vodka ads for featuring influencers who were, or appeared to be, under 25.</p>

          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced that all suppliers in England, Scotland, and Wales must offer customers a tariff with a lower standing charge by the end of January. This move addresses complaints from consumers who have little control over the fixed daily fees for being connected to the grid. However, these new tariffs will feature higher rates for each unit of energy used, meaning overall bills are unlikely to decrease. While the plan provides more choice, consumer advocates and charities have expressed disappointment, warning that it does not solve the fundamental problem of high energy costs for households.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are highlighting the connection between climate change and the increasing frequency and intensity of powerful storms like Super Typhoon Ragasa. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for typhoons, allowing them to intensify more rapidly and grow larger in size. Experts note that climate change also causes these storms to stall along coastlines, leading to colossal amounts of rainfall in one area instead of moving inland and dissipating. The United Nations Environment Programme reports that average temperatures in the Pacific Ocean have already risen by approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius over the last century, fueling these more destructive weather events.</p>

          <p>Retailer JD Sports has announced a 13.5% drop in profits for the first half of the year, attributing the decline to "strained consumer finances." The company saw sales at established stores fall across all its major markets, with North America and the UK experiencing the most significant downturns. In response to the challenging economic environment, the company is focusing on cost control and operational discipline. While the acquisition of other brands boosted overall sales figures, the underlying performance reflects cautious consumer spending. The retailer also noted that the impact of U.S. tariffs is expected to be limited in the short term.</p>
