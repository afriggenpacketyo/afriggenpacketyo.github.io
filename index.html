        <p>Binance CEO Richard Teng anticipates that President Trump's pro-crypto legislation in the U.S. will encourage global crypto adoption.  He contrasts this with the previous administration's stricter regulatory approach.  Teng highlights Trump's executive order establishing a U.S. cryptocurrency reserve as a significant factor, although recent market pullbacks have been attributed to macroeconomic concerns and details of the reserve plan falling short of expectations.  HashKey Capital CEO Chao Deng shares a similar positive outlook on the current administration's stance toward crypto.</p>

        <p>Despite a 73% increase in annual profits, the John Lewis Partnership will not reinstate staff bonuses for the third consecutive year.  The company cites investment in its business and worker pay as the reason.  While shop workers received a 7.4% pay rise, the bonus freeze marks the fourth time in five years.  The company acknowledges the challenging economic environment but remains confident in its ability to improve profits in the future.  Job losses are anticipated, but the company aims to minimize redundancies through attrition and redeployment.</p>
