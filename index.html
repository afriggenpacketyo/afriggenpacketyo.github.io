          <p>MicroStrategy's bitcoin treasury strategy, which propelled its market cap beyond $80 billion, is inspiring other companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates, to adopt similar approaches. Trump Media and GameStop have announced plans to allocate significant portions of their assets to bitcoin. Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, believes this trend signifies a global shift in corporate finance, driven by the increasing popularity of bitcoin as a long-term store of value. The Trump administration has also taken steps to treat bitcoin as a strategic asset, establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve funded through seized assets and Vice President JD Vance has voiced his support for crypto as a hedge against inflation.

          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have decided to appoint ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a thaw in their strained relationship. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing where the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China discussed improving bilateral ties. Relations between the two countries have been tense due to accusations of harboring the Pakistani Taliban and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees.

Separately, President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, offering support for the Japanese company's $14 billion investment into the American producer, and Japan and the U.S. are reportedly making progress towards a potential tariff deal as early as June.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece accuses National Public Radio (NPR) of partisan bias and criticizes media coverage of NPR's lawsuit against President Trump over defunding attempts. The article claims NPR routinely violates the Public Broadcasting Act's requirement for objectivity and balance, citing examples of alleged anti-Trump bias and favoritism towards Democratic viewpoints. The piece highlights a lack of conservative perspectives in NPR's reporting and suggests the lawsuit is an attempt to force conservatives to fund speech they oppose. The author argues that NPR's CEO denies bias despite evidence to the contrary.</p>

          <p>Workers at the U.S. Department of Energy are raising concerns that budget cuts and deregulation efforts will undermine the department's ability to function effectively, leading to higher energy costs for consumers. A report by the Rhodium Group suggests that repealing energy tax credits could increase household energy costs by as much as 7% by 2035. Proposed budget cuts of $19.3 billion and the elimination of 47 regulations, mainly energy efficiency standards, are expected to exacerbate the issue. Critics argue that these changes will disproportionately affect low-income households and hinder the development of renewable energy technologies.</p>

          <p>Georgia, a key swing state with a substantial economy, is serving as a bellwether for the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs on U.S. businesses. The wine industry faces potential disruptions as distributors struggle to secure shipments before tariffs restart, while the film industry remains uncertain about the implications of proposed tariffs on foreign-produced films. Industrial manufacturers, however, argue that well-positioned businesses may profit from the tariffs. Unpredictability and volatility are affecting businesses, as demonstrated by fluctuating shipping volumes and logistical challenges, and the state's ports anticipate a decrease in shipping volumes.</p>

          <p>A rare, gold-colored lobster was saved from being cooked at a restaurant in Charlestown, Rhode Island, after a cook noticed its unusual coloring. The lobster, named Calvin, has a genetic mutation that occurs in only about one in 30 million lobsters, resulting in a yellowish-orange shell. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center in North Kingstown, where it is now on display. Despite the rarity of gold lobsters, the center director noted that he has encountered about 10 in his career, underscoring the vast number of lobsters caught.</p>

The columnist highlights the case of Evan Anzoo, a 5-year-old boy with HIV in South Sudan who relied on American antiretroviral medicines.

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is entering the Atlantic hurricane season with significant staffing shortages due to recent cuts and buyouts, raising concerns about the agency's ability to provide accurate and timely forecasts.

Former Weather Service directors have urged the Trump administration to replenish resources to avoid potential loss of life.

          <p>The situation has eased overnight following a rock fall and glacier collapse in the Swiss Lötschental valley. Water that had accumulated behind the collapsed glacier has begun to flow downstream, alleviating fears of a potential flood wave. Construction machinery has been deployed to manage the runoff of accumulated water, and residents, who were on alert and ready to evacuate, will likely have to remain vigilant due to forecast rain. The village of Blatten, which was buried by the landslide, will be rebuilt.</p>

Jewish-led organizing has broadened in recent months, with groups like Jewish Voice for Peace mobilizing against the war in Gaza and authoritarianism in the U.S. Many Jewish Americans are invoking their Jewishness in a public way for the first time to challenge the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has sparked controversy by issuing pardons to convicted drug dealers, even as he advocates for escalating the U.S. drug war and imposing harsher penalties for drug offenses. Among those pardoned is Larry Hoover, a leader of the Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences. While the White House defends these decisions as instances where "the punishment does not always fit the crime," critics point to a mixed message that undermines efforts to combat drug trafficking. Some observers suggest Trump's pardons are transactional, influenced by powerful individuals or political considerations.</p>
