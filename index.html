          <p>An explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems factory near McEwen, Tennessee, has left no survivors among the 18 people who were inside the building at the time of the blast. The powerful explosion, which was felt for miles, completely leveled a building at the 1,300-acre facility that manufactures explosives for military and commercial use. Officials have transitioned the operation from rescue to recovery, stating that the process of identifying the victims will require DNA testing. The cause of the explosion is currently under investigation by multiple agencies, including the FBI and ATF.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team maintained their undefeated record in the World Cup with an 89-run victory against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a magnificent 117 runs after being dropped early in her innings, guiding England to a total of 253-9. In response, Sri Lanka's batting lineup faltered against Sophie Ecclestone's exceptional bowling, which yielded four wickets for just 17 runs. The win places England at the top of the tournament table ahead of their next match against Pakistan.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops for patrols in Memphis, Tennessee, coincided with an incident near Chicago where two U.S. senators were barred from entering an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth sought to tour the Broadview facility and deliver supplies to protestors but were denied entry, which they described as "shameful" stonewalling. Meanwhile, the Memphis deployment, supported by the state's governor, is part of a federal crime crackdown, contrasting with recent court rulings that blocked similar troop deployments in Chicago and Portland over concerns of federal overreach.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London in April 2024, has been retired to a sanctuary in the countryside. The 15-year-old horse sustained significant injuries after being spooked by construction noise, an incident that also injured five soldiers and four civilians. Due to the severity of his injuries, Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. He will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, a decision made for his long-term welfare.</p>

The Florida-based carrier, which operated a fleet of Cirrus SF50 Vision jets for short-haul flights, had accumulated over $38.7 million in liabilities. The company's collapse was compounded by the sudden death of its founder in September and multiple lawsuits from customers and creditors over unfulfilled services.

The plan, endorsed at the party conference in Aberdeen, states that winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election will constitute a mandate to negotiate for another vote on independence. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. An alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum by winning over 50% of the popular vote was rejected by the party leadership.</p>

          <p>Two women in Jacksonville, Florida, have become the first to be arrested under the state's new "Halo Law," which creates a 25-foot buffer zone around first responders. The arrests of Anita Gibson and Jasmine Jefferson occurred during a chaotic scene where another woman, Erika McGriff, was being arrested for allegedly battering a police officer. According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Gibson and Jefferson were charged because they entered the buffer zone and acted in a harassing or impeding manner. Sheriff T.K. Waters stated that while recording is permitted from beyond 25 feet, the law will be enforced against those who interfere with officers' duties.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has begun a course of radiation and hormone therapy to treat an aggressive form of prostate cancer. The diagnosis, which was first revealed in May, indicated that the cancer had metastasized to the bone but was considered hormone-sensitive, suggesting it would respond well to treatment. This new stage of his care follows a successful Mohs surgery in September to remove cancerous cells from his skin. According to his spokesperson, the 82-year-old former president is currently doing well as he undergoes the five-week radiation treatment plan.</p>

          <p>Spanish police have arrested an individual after discovering a horrific scene at an illegal animal breeding facility in Meson do Vento, where the corpses of 250 animals, mostly dogs, were found. The warehouse was described as having "extremely poor" hygiene conditions, with cages covered in excrement and dead animals in various stages of decomposition. Authorities rescued 171 surviving animals, including exotic birds, which were found in life-threatening conditions and had resorted to feeding on the dead for survival. The site manager faces charges of animal abuse, illegal possession of protected species, and practicing veterinary medicine without a license.</p>

          <p>The continent of Africa, which has the world's youngest population with a median age of 19, is ironically home to numerous aging leaders, a phenomenon exemplified by Cameroon's 92-year-old President Paul Biya. Biya, who has ruled for 43 years, is seeking an eighth term in office, joining other long-serving octogenarian leaders in countries like Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Zimbabwe. This trend of "third-termism" and gerontocracy creates a stark contrast with the continent's youthful demographic. However, there are signs of change as youth-led protest movements gain traction and some younger leaders begin to rise to power.</p>

Local activists reported that the Dar al-Arqam camp, located within a university, was hit by two drones and multiple artillery shells, killing and burning children, women, and the elderly. The attack has overwhelmed the city's struggling hospitals and adds to a worsening humanitarian crisis as the RSF continues its 17-month siege to capture the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region, trapping 250,000 civilians.</p>

          <p>Political analysts are highlighting President Donald Trump's role as a critical factor in brokering the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which aims to end the war in Gaza. According to reporting from a "Washington Week" panel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long prided himself on understanding American politics, likely yielded to U.S. pressure due to his fundamental need for American support. This perspective suggests that as American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, direct pressure from the U.S. president became a decisive element in bringing the parties to an agreement.</p>

          <p>According to BlackRock's Jay Jacobs, a significant trend in 2025 sees investors moving away from traditional, broad technology sector funds and into more targeted, thematic ETFs focused on artificial intelligence and blockchain. Investors are seeking more granular exposure to the entire AI ecosystem, from semiconductor manufacturing to large language models, through funds like BlackRock's iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI). Similarly, enthusiasm for blockchain technology, particularly surrounding Ethereum, is driving interest in cryptocurrency-related ETFs, a trend further supported by new stablecoin legislation signed into law.

          <p>Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops, Hamas has reportedly recalled around 7,000 members of its security forces to re-establish control over parts of Gaza, raising concerns about potential internal violence. The mobilization aims to counter "outlaws and collaborators" and comes after a violent clash where members of the powerful Dughmush clan killed two Hamas operatives. This move to reassert authority, including appointing new governors with military backgrounds, could complicate the next phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm, and has led to fears of a civil war in the war-torn territory.</p>

Others, such as New York's Metrograph, have found success as for-profit ventures by offering a premium experience with a restaurant, bookstore, and curated programming.

While discussing his first-term achievement of lowering drug prices by "one-eighth of 1 percent," he claimed that prices would soon be going down by "100 percent, 400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent in some cases." A price reduction of 100 percent would make a product free, and any reduction greater than 100 percent is not possible. Trump asserted these massive, impossible cuts would have a huge impact on programs like Social Security and Medicare.</p>
