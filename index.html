          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been ruled out of the final Test match against India due to a shoulder injury sustained in the previous game. Despite the setback, Stokes expressed confidence that the injury is minor and will not affect his availability for the upcoming Ashes series. Ollie Pope will take over as captain in his absence, while the team has also made three changes to its bowling lineup to bring in fresh players for the decisive match.</p>

          <p>A gunman who killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building was apparently targeting the NFL's headquarters, according to New York City's mayor. Investigators found a note in which the shooter, Shane Tamura, referenced the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. Tamura mistakenly took an elevator to a different company's office, where he carried out the attack before taking his own life. The investigation is ongoing, focusing on his past mental health incidents.</p>

These firms are bracing for higher import taxes on materials like steel and aluminum, which affects everything from tools to food packaging. While some companies are absorbing the costs for now, there are growing concerns that these financial pressures will soon be passed on to consumers through higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Adidas dropped over 7% after the German sportswear giant warned that U.S. tariffs would have a significant financial impact, potentially costing the company an additional €200 million. In response, Adidas confirmed it will raise prices for its products in the U.S. market. The company, which sources a large portion of its goods from Asian countries affected by the levies, maintained its full-year guidance but noted elevated uncertainty due to the trade situation.

          <p>Global support for the recognition of a Palestinian state is gaining momentum, highlighted by a joint appeal from 15 countries following a UN conference. The statement affirmed an "unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution." Notably, several signatories that have not yet recognized Palestine, including Australia, Canada, and the UK, expressed their willingness to move toward recognition, increasing diplomatic pressure on Israel and its allies to re-engage with the peace process.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How a 1930s Black Fascist's Critique of Liberalism Echoes in Modern Political Discourse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the work of Lawrence Dennis, a Black American intellectual who advocated for fascism in the 1930s, believing liberalism was doomed to fail. The author draws parallels between Dennis's arguments and those of contemporary right-wing critics of liberalism, identifying common rhetorical patterns. These include declaring liberalism's inevitable collapse based on a recent crisis and idealizing illiberal alternatives, a line of reasoning the author warns against repeating today.</p>

          <p>The women-only dating safety app Tea has suspended its direct messaging service after a major cybersecurity breach exposed user data, including private messages and thousands of images.

          <p>New research indicates that Elon Musk's rightward political alignment has negatively impacted not only Tesla's appeal among U.S. liberals but also their overall willingness to purchase any electric vehicle. The study found that as Musk allied himself with Donald Trump, liberals' intent to buy an EV dropped significantly, suggesting the CEO's persona has become synonymous with the entire product class. Meanwhile, conservatives' skepticism toward EVs has remained largely unchanged despite their more favorable view of Musk.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer's newest expansion team, San Diego FC, is achieving historic success in its debut season with an unusually high-risk, possession-based style of play. The team emphasizes building up from the back, with goalkeepers rarely playing long passes—a statistical anomaly in MLS and top European leagues. This brave tactical approach, executed by a very young and budget-conscious defensive line, has unexpectedly vaulted the team to the top of the Western Conference standings.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece uses the massive data breach of the women's dating app Tea to illustrate the precarious state of online privacy. The author argues that the hack, which exposed highly sensitive user conversations and verification photos, demonstrates how platforms designed for safety can become tools for harm. The breach is framed as particularly malicious, as it was reportedly instigated by misogynistic trolls on 4chan who were specifically targeting the women-only community.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the cumulative stress of living through the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a subtle but measurable acceleration of brain aging. This effect was observed even in individuals who were never infected with the virus, suggesting that factors like prolonged isolation, stress, and disrupted routines contributed to the changes. The study also found that those who did contract COVID-19, even mild cases, showed small declines in cognitive performance, particularly in processing speed.</p>

          <p>Despite official policies limiting direct cooperation, the Los Angeles Police Department is indirectly assisting federal immigration enforcement by routinely sharing fingerprint data. When an undocumented person is arrested, their information can trigger an alert to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), leading to deportation proceedings even if no criminal charges are filed. This practice has drawn criticism from city officials and activists, who argue it erodes trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A significant number of U.S. states are considering new laws to ban or require warning labels for synthetic food dyes and other chemical additives. This legislative trend is fueled by consumer frustration with perceived federal inaction and has gained support from a broad political spectrum, including the conservative "Make America Healthy Again" movement. While some laws have already passed, the food industry raises concerns about the logistical challenges of navigating a patchwork of different state regulations.</p>
