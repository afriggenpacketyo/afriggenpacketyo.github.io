          <p>The Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles has issued a safety advisory urging Chinese citizens in the area to be vigilant due to ongoing law enforcement actions targeting immigration-related protests. The advisory emphasizes monitoring official announcements and media reports, taking safety precautions, avoiding gatherings and crowded areas, and refraining from going out at night or traveling alone. This comes as approximately 300 California National Guard troops were deployed in Los Angeles to support federal law enforcement amid escalating clashes between protesters and immigration agents. The White House stated that President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address what he termed "the lawlessness" in California.</p>

The Home Office is arguing for maintaining police numbers to deliver on neighborhood policing commitments, which they claim current proposals would hinder. The review is expected to include extra money for the NHS, potentially at the expense of other departments as the Chancellor aims to meet fiscal rules. (not investment advice)</p>

The government claims the pay rise will bring new starter nurses' earnings to over Â£30,000 for the first time, but the RCN argues nursing continues to be undervalued.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has initiated a nationwide strategy to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings as they leave courtrooms, focusing on those who have been in the United States for less than two years. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to have immigration cases dropped, placing migrants in expedited removal proceedings for swift deportation. This initiative has sparked controversy, with concerns that it will discourage migrants from attending asylum hearings and lead to arrests of individuals with no criminal history aside from illegal entry. Some legal experts argue that immigration judges can restrict such arrests by refusing to dismiss cases.</p>

The command structure varies, with state governors assuming command during in-state deployments, while the US president serves as commander-in-chief during nationwide deployments.

          <p>A search is underway for six people missing after a small plane crashed in the ocean off the coast of San Diego. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report that a twin-engine Cessna 414 crashed approximately three miles west of Point Loma. Multiple agencies are involved in the search, including air and marine Coast Guard crews, Customs & Border Protection crews, San Diego Harbor Police, and San Diego Lifeguard crews.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that the Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s (RBI) unexpected rate cut will pressure foreign exchange forward premiums, leaving the rupee vulnerable to depreciation. The rupee has already underperformed its Asian peers due to weak capital flows, and a narrowing interest rate differential with the U.S. Federal Reserve could further weaken the currency. A drop in dollar/rupee forward premiums makes the rupee less attractive for carry trades and reduces incentives for exporters to hedge receivables. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant decline of 34.5% in May, marking the sharpest drop since February 2020, according to Wind Information. Overall exports rose 4.8% but missed expectations, while imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. The decrease in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. The decline in exports of rare earths indicates China's tightening of export controls during trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters to protect marine life and the seabed. The proposal would expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas, covering 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The announcement comes as a UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with Sir David Attenborough warning about the destructive impacts of bottom trawling.

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a significant backlash in response to President Trump's escalation of immigration enforcement, including the deployment of National Guard soldiers. Trump's administration has promised to quell protests and warned local leaders to brace for increased immigration enforcement. Federal agents have been conducting raids, leading to arrests and protests, with union leader David Huerta among those arrested. The escalating force and bypassing of the governor have fueled anger, with communities mobilizing against the raids.</p>
