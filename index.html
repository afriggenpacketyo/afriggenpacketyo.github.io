          <h2>Trump Officials Crafting Rule to Prevent Asylum-Seekers from Getting Work Permits</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump administration officials are developing a rule that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially disrupting longstanding U.S. immigration policy. The proposal by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials would effectively pause the policy of allowing migrants with pending asylum claims to work lawfully while their cases are decided. This move is part of President Trump's broader immigration crackdown, targeting a backlogged asylum system that his aides believe is exploited by economic migrants. However, advocates argue that halting work permits could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, driving them to work illegally. This change could significantly impact asylum-seekers and the U.S. economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating a regulation that could prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering long-standing U.S. immigration policy. Officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services propose suspending the issuance of new work permits until asylum claims are decided within an average of 180 days, a challenging timeframe given existing backlogs. Advocates worry this could hinder migrants' ability to support themselves, pushing them into the underground economy. The proposed changes aim to address what the administration views as exploitation of the asylum system for economic migration. Optimism about the situation is low, considering the potential negative impacts on asylum seekers and the already strained immigration system.</p>

Zhongman used air-foam drilling to tackle unstable aquifers, a technique now adopted by many Egyptian drilling companies. This initiative is part of China's broader effort to export agricultural technology to emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East, reflecting a strategic alignment to address development challenges.

Senate Bill 243 requires operators of companion chatbot platforms to remind users every three hours that the virtual characters aren't human and disclose that the chatbots might not be suitable for some minors. Platforms would also need to implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation or self-harm expressed by users, including providing suicide prevention resources.

Other vessels on the renaming "recommended list" include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman.

          <p>A New Mexico appeals court has rejected a lawsuit alleging that the state failed to meet constitutional provisions for protecting against oil and gas industry pollution. The court found it beyond the judiciary's authority to weigh whether pollution controls are adequate, deferring to the Legislature's balancing of environmental regulation with natural resources development. Environmental advocates vowed to appeal the matter to the state's top court, arguing that the ruling renders the constitution's pollution-control clause meaningless. The challenge comes as New Mexico experiences record income from oil development in the Permian Basin, highlighting the ongoing tension between economic interests and environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Pornhub, along with RedTube and YouPorn, has temporarily blocked access to its adult content in France to protest new age verification regulations. The company is displaying a statement on its French site regarding the new rules, which require porn sites to verify users are 18 or older. The French government is pushing to shield minors from inappropriate content, requiring sites to verify age using credit cards or government-issued IDs. Aylo, Pornhub's parent company, argues that age verification should be done on devices rather than websites, calling the government's measures potentially privacy-infringing and ineffective. The move highlights the ongoing debate over how to protect minors online.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" and reflecting wider tensions within the Republican Party. Musk stated that the bill will "massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit" and burden American citizens with unsustainable debt. He ended his term in the Trump administration on May 31 and has previously called the plan "disappointing." The bill proposes extending tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration, increased defense spending, and funding for mass deportations. Musk's comments suggest a rift with Trump, despite his past support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aid distribution centers in Gaza are closed for a day as the Israeli military warns that roads leading to the sites will be considered "combat zones." The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US- and Israel-backed aid network, is also temporarily ceasing operations for organizational improvements. This decision follows a deadly incident where at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near a distribution center. The UN has called for an investigation, and concerns are growing about the safety and effectiveness of the GHF's aid distribution model, which relies on armed contractors and requires civilians to travel long distances in militarized zones. The safety and accessibility of aid for civilians are in question.</p>

          <p>The UK has been temporarily spared from President Donald Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. This exemption depends on the US-UK tariff pact signed in May, which would eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs but has yet to take effect. The order raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries from Wednesday, but the levy remains at 25% for the UK. The UK government said it is "committed to protecting British business and jobs" and will "continue to work with the US to implement our agreement." Uncertainty remains over the timings and final tariff rates.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that President Donald Trump's actions, particularly tariffs and a jingoistic approach, distort market valuations. He suggests that investors are more inclined to take short positions, anticipating market declines due to Trump's unpredictable statements. Cramer believes Wall Street underestimates the necessity of artificial intelligence infrastructure, pointing to Nvidia's fluctuating stock performance as an example. He asserts that Trump has revived the short selling business, with hedge funds betting against stocks like Nvidia. Cramer concludes that short sellers are overconfident and can suffer losses when businesses perform well, particularly when the White House is less disruptive.</p>
