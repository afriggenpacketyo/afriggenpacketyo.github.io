          <h2>Musk to Reduce DOGE Involvement Amid Tesla's Financial Struggles</h2>

          <p>Elon Musk announced he will significantly reduce his time commitment to the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in May, shifting focus back to Tesla. This decision comes as Tesla faces a 71% drop in profits and a 9% decrease in revenue, partly attributed to a consumer backlash against Musk's political activities and Trump's tariffs. Analysts suggest Musk's political involvement has tarnished the Tesla brand, impacting sales and stock value. The company also faces increasing competition from other electric vehicle manufacturers and potential harm from tariff retaliation from China.</p>

          <p>Tesla's profits experienced a significant decline of 71% in the first quarter of 2025, coinciding with a slump in sales and stock value, as well as protests against CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. Revenue from car sales decreased by 20% compared to the previous year, prompting Musk to defend his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and announce a shift of focus back to Tesla. The company acknowledged that "changing political sentiment" and the "current tariff landscape" could negatively impact demand and business operations. Shareholders have been calling for Musk to step down from his White House role to fully dedicate himself to Tesla.</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Ed McCaffrey believes that NFL prospect Travis Hunter should prioritize playing cornerback over wide receiver in the pros, despite Hunter's success at both positions in college. McCaffrey argues that Hunter currently provides greater value as a cornerback due to his refined mechanics, while Hunter himself insists he would quit football if forced to choose one position. The Cleveland Browns, a team favored to draft Hunter, have indicated they primarily view him as a receiver. Last season, Hunter played extensively on both offense and defense, showcasing his versatility and productivity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before Powell's term ends next year, marking a significant shift from his recent rhetoric. Trump had previously ramped up criticism against Powell and suggested he might remove him, expressing frustration over interest rates. This reversal comes after Trump had been pressuring the Fed chair to cut interest rates in an effort to stimulate economic growth.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The FDA will work with food companies to remove dyes from products, citing studies linking synthetic dyes to health conditions like ADHD, obesity, and cancer. The plan involves revoking authorization for two synthetic food colorings and eliminating six others, while also authorizing four new natural color additives. This initiative follows previous efforts to ban Red No. 3 and aims to encourage the food industry to transition to natural alternatives.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year, despite the UK facing higher-than-expected inflation. The IMF predicts UK inflation to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1% in 2025, largely due to increased energy and water bills. The UK's economic growth forecast was also downgraded to 1.1%, attributed to global fallout from US trade tariffs. The IMF expects the spike in inflation to be temporary, allowing for future rate cuts, and anticipates UK inflation to slow to 2.2% by 2026.</p>

          <p>A jury concluded that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial, rejecting Palin's claim that the error damaged her reputation. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun violence that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to the 2011 shooting of Gabby Giffords. The Times issued a correction less than 14 hours after publication, and the former editorial page editor apologized for the error.

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed inclined to rule in favor of parents who object to LGBTQ-themed books in public schools, suggesting that school districts must allow parents to opt their children out of classes where the material conflicts with their religious beliefs. The case involves a school system in Montgomery County, Maryland, which adopted a curriculum promoting respect for LGBTQ+ parents and children. The justices questioned the school board's decision to eliminate opt-out options for parents who found the material objectionable, raising concerns about religious freedom and parental rights.</p>

The universal tariff rate on goods imported into the United States is currently 10%, with tariffs on imports from China reaching as high as 145%.</p>
