          <p>Meta is implementing layoffs impacting approximately 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit, a move designed to streamline operations and consolidate Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang's leadership. The cuts, which spare top-tier hires in Superintelligence Labs, reflect CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push for greater agility and faster AI development, following previous lukewarm responses to Meta's Llama models. This strategic overhaul comes as the company continues to pour billions into AI infrastructure and recruitment to stay competitive with rivals. The layoffs are part of Meta's broader efforts to trim the department and cement Wang's role in steering its AI strategy, despite projecting increased expenses for upcoming years.</p>

          <p>The White House East Wing is slated for complete demolition within days to accommodate President Donald Trump's $250 million ballroom addition, marking a substantial increase in the project's scope. Initial plans suggested the ballroom would not interfere with the existing structure, but officials now cite structural reasons for the full demolition, which Trump called "music to my ears." This decision has drawn "deep concern" from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a non-profit organization advocating for a public review process for changes to the historic landmark. The new ballroom is intended to provide a grand space for state visits and parties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's insufficient commitment to a peace process in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced these measures, urging an immediate ceasefire and indicating readiness for further action to support President Trump's efforts to end the conflict. These sanctions are designed to hinder the Kremlin's revenue generation for its war against Ukraine. A senior White House official linked these new restrictions to the collapse of plans for a meeting between President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Budapest, suggesting a hardening stance from the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the process of hair turning gray might be surprisingly linked to the body's defense against melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. Scientists at Tokyo Medical and Dental University found that pigment-producing stem cells in hair follicles react to DNA damage in two distinct ways: either by dying off, leading to gray hair, or by surviving and multiplying, which could potentially trigger melanoma. This indicates a biological trade-off where graying could be the body's method of eliminating damaged cells, thus preventing them from becoming cancerous. The study, conducted in mice, offers new insights into aging and cancer prevention.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in an intensified effort to compel Moscow towards a peace agreement in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explicitly linked these measures to President Putin's refusal to end the conflict, emphasizing their role in funding Russia's war machine. The announcement coincided with a visit from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte to the White House to discuss peace negotiations and followed intense Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine.

          <p>Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon 22-hour and 37-minute speech on the Senate floor, protesting President Trump's administration policies. Merkley vehemently criticized the administration's deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, and the deployment of National Guard troops to cities like Portland, Oregon, which he represents. He characterized the current political climate as the most perilous moment for the republic since the Civil War, accusing Trump of "shredding our Constitution" and attempting to strengthen an authoritarian grip. This extended address, among the longest in Senate history, provided a significant platform for Democrats to voice their strong opposition amidst an ongoing government shutdown.</p>

She expressed disagreement with the current administration's broader goal of "making everything in America," suggesting a more targeted approach.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented a new policy, outlined in a memo, that mandates formal approval for nearly all Department of Defense correspondence and interactions with Congress. This directive extends to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commanders, and military department secretaries, channeling all legislative affairs activities through the assistant secretary. The memo asserts that "unauthorized engagements" could compromise departmental legislative objectives. This move, which includes a limited carve-out for the Inspector General, raises significant concerns regarding government transparency, oversight, and the Pentagon's accountability to congressional bodies.</p>

          <p>Data from the FDIC reveals that traditional savings accounts offer negligible returns at an average of 0.40%, falling short of inflation. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts still typically offer rates between 4.20% and 4.30%, with potential for even higher online. This article calculates the potential interest earnings for various deposit amounts over different periods, assuming a constant 4.30% rate, showing that savers can still accumulate hundreds of dollars. It also suggests considering Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts for fixed rates, as they offer stability against predicted future rate cuts, despite requiring funds to be locked away.

          <p>President Donald Trump reportedly dined at the White House with Rupert Murdoch and his media executives last week, despite Trump's ongoing $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. The lawsuit stems from a Journal report alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" 50th birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump vehemently denies. This dinner highlights the complex relationship between Trump and Murdoch's conservative media empire, which often supports him. Trump's legal team recently filed a strong response to Murdoch's lawyers' motion to dismiss the case, emphasizing the dispute's contentious nature.</p>

The proposals, one for Maale Adumim and another for the entire West Bank, were supported by far-right ministers who advocate for full Israeli sovereignty.

          <p>Wholesale prices for frozen turkeys are estimated to reach $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. This surge is primarily attributed to a reduced supply of turkeys, impacted by slightly weakened demand and ongoing avian flu outbreaks, which have affected over 3 million birds this year. Despite the wholesale increase, retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering competitive deals, such as a 10-person meal for under $40, using turkeys as "loss leaders" to attract customers. Experts anticipate consumer prices will see a smaller increase than wholesale costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many Americans could receive significantly larger tax refunds next year, primarily due to new provisions in the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act, which are retroactive to the start of the current year. An Oxford Economics analysis estimates total taxpayer savings could reach an additional $50 billion through bigger refunds or lower 2026 tax bills. The new law extends 2017 tax cuts and introduces breaks like eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, and raising the SALT deduction cap. While the IRS hasn't updated withholding tables, many taxpayers will have overpaid, leading to a "windfall at tax time" in 2026, disproportionately benefiting higher-income households.
