          <p>British number one Jack Draper has withdrawn from the US Open before his second-round match, citing an arm injury, a significant blow for the fifth seed who was a semi-finalist last year. The 23-year-old had already endured a challenging four-set victory in his opening round, indicating the strain he was under. His decision, announced via a statement on X, underscores the immense physical demands placed on elite tennis players and the difficult choice to prioritize long-term health over major competition, even when it means sacrificing a promising tournament run. This unfortunate development leaves a void in the men's singles draw, impacting the overall competitive landscape and disappointing fans who had high hopes for his performance in New York.</p>

          <p>Nine Panamanian lawmakers have joined the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), a global group Beijing has labeled an "anti-China front," sparking a strong rebuke from China. State media and diplomats accused Washington of coercion and attempting to drive a wedge between the two nations, particularly after the U.S. ambassador attended the announcement. The Panamanian legislators emphasized their commitment to defending democracy and human rights against external interference, with IPAC planning an international meeting in November to further scrutinize China's regional influence. This development underscores the intensifying geopolitical competition between the United States and China for diplomatic and economic sway in Latin America.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the latest Covid vaccines in the U.S., but with new limitations, clearing them only for individuals at higher risk of severe illness, such as those aged 65 and up or younger adults with underlying conditions. This policy shift, influenced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, marks a departure from previous broad recommendations for annual shots for all ages. The change could complicate vaccine access for millions and raises questions about insurance coverage for healthy adults. Kennedy emphasized patient choice with doctor consultation, but the new framework signals a more cautious approach to widespread immunization.</p>

          <p>Lego reported record earnings in the first half of 2025, with revenue increasing by 12% to $5.44 billion, fueled by popular botanical-themed brick sets and successful partnerships. Collaborations with major brands like Formula 1, the animated series "Bluey," and upcoming Pokémon sets significantly boosted consumer sales, which grew by 13%. CEO Niels Christiansen attributed this growth to the company's innovative and diverse product range appealing across various age groups and interests. Lego also expanded its global retail presence, opening 24 new stores and solidifying its position as the world's largest toymaker amidst evolving consumer trends.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani met with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Yvette Clarke, as prominent New York Democrats continue to withhold endorsements for the self-described democratic socialist. The meeting focused on issues like the affordability crisis and the exodus of Black New Yorkers, with Mamdani sharing his agenda. While some progressive leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have endorsed him, Jeffries and Clarke have yet to, with Clarke having previously raised concerns about Mamdani's past rhetoric. The situation highlights internal divisions within the Democratic Party regarding progressive candidates and their broader appeal.</p>

          <p>Israeli tanks have advanced into Gaza City's outskirts, prompting further displacement, as the military prepares for a major offensive against what it calls Hamas's last stronghold. This push occurs despite tens of thousands of Israelis protesting, urging their government to accept a ceasefire deal to secure the release of 50 remaining hostages. Protesters criticized Prime Minister Netanyahu for seemingly prioritizing military action over a potential deal, which Hamas has already accepted. The ongoing conflict has led to over 62,000 Palestinian casualties, with international mediators awaiting Israel's formal response to the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal.</p>

          <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson will not face charges in connection with an alleged assault at St Pancras railway station in London on July 28. British Transport Police (BTP) stated that the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, partly because the alleged victim declined to provide a statement. Robinson, 42, had been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after footage showed him near a person lying motionless on the floor. He maintained he was acting in self-defense, and the decision closes the criminal investigation into the incident.</p>

Goldman Sachs analysts share this bullish outlook, forecasting increased iPhone revenues and reiterating a buy rating, citing form factor updates, potential price increases for the Pro model, and carrier promotions.
