          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.3 billion for the upcoming Wednesday drawing, with a cash value of approximately $589 million, after no tickets matched all winning numbers in Monday's $1.2 billion drawing. This marks the sixth time in the game's 33-year history that the top prize has surpassed the billion-dollar mark, highlighting the rarity and excitement surrounding such a large sum. The previous drawing saw nine tickets win $1 million by matching five white balls across several states, though none secured the grand prize. With no winner since May 31, anticipation is building for the next drawing, where tickets are available for $2 in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

          <p>Three people, including a six-year-old boy now in critical condition, were hospitalized after a minivan drove through a barricaded section of the Kipona Festival in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The incident unfolded just after 6 p.m. on Monday, as the annual Labor Day weekend event was concluding. Police have taken the driver into custody and are actively investigating the circumstances, including whether the act was intentional. Two adults, one a city traffic engineering department employee and another a woman in a wheelchair, sustained stable injuries. This developing story has prompted a swift response from local authorities, who are working to understand the full scope of the event.</p>

          <p>Belgium's Foreign Minister, Maxime Prevot, announced the country's intention to recognize an independent Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly this month, alongside imposing "tough sanctions" on the Israeli government. Prevot condemned both antisemitism and Hamas's glorification of terrorism, emphasizing the need for decisive action to pressure both Israeli and Hamas entities. This move comes as Israeli strikes in Gaza City killed 13 people, and the UN estimates nearly a million people reside in the area facing an Israeli offensive. Several other nations, including France and Australia, have also indicated similar intentions to recognize Palestinian statehood.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pickleball is seeing a significant surge in popularity in China, mirroring the U.S. craze, with online sales of equipment skyrocketing over six-fold this year to an average of $1.2 million monthly. This growth is attributed to a broader shift towards active lifestyles, social media influence, and a resurgence of racquet sports following Chinese tennis player Zheng Qinwen's Olympic gold. Unlike the U.S., China's urban density means private businesses are driving court development for profit, and the sport's ease of learning is appealing. Despite challenges like language barriers for foreign brands, the market is ripe for expansion, with many eager to be first movers.</p>

India's markets were particularly in focus after President Trump claimed India offered to reduce its tariffs to zero, a statement he paired with criticism of the U.S.-India trade relationship. Meanwhile, Australia's market was flat, and a local unit of Societe Generale received a fine for failing to prevent suspicious orders in commodity futures markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox initiated an ambitious plan to build 35,000 lower-cost starter homes in five years, addressing the state's soaring housing prices and record-high median age for first-time homebuyers. Despite legislative incentives like low-interest construction loans, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. Housing experts suggest bolder zoning changes are needed, but lawmakers rejected such proposals. One developer, Jed Nilson, has successfully built starter homes under $400,000 by leveraging state aid and smaller plot sizes, offering a glimmer of hope for young couples like Miranda and Cole Potokar, who recently purchased one.</p>

Nadler, who chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as a manager for Trump's first impeachment, made the decision in December 2024.

          <p>Significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), stemming from President Trump's tax law, are now taking effect, marking what some estimate as the largest reduction in SNAP history. These changes are projected to remove 2.4 million Americans from food stamp benefits monthly, with families potentially losing $72 to $231 in support. While independent grocers anticipate severe negative impacts, larger discount retailers like Walmart and Costco may paradoxically benefit as consumers "trade down" to stretch their reduced dollars.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in China by train to attend a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, marking his first visit since 2019. He is expected to join Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, potentially for a trilateral meeting to discuss their deepening ties. This visit occurs as U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung express hopes for renewed talks with Pyongyang, which has so far refused. North Korea has actively supported Russia in Ukraine, reportedly in exchange for economic and military assistance.</p>

          <p>A computer scientist at Bradford University used a unique algorithm to analyze a photo of a decomposed body from a secret Libyan mortuary, showing a "high probability" it belongs to Musa al-Sadr, a revered Shia cleric who vanished in Libya in 1978. The finding suggests Sadr, whose disappearance has fueled decades of conspiracy theories and significantly impacted the Middle East, was likely killed, possibly by a blow or bullet to the head. The BBC investigation, which included the journalist who took the original photo, faced detention in Libya due to the sensitivity of the case. Sadr's family and the political party he founded, Amal, still maintain he is alive.</p>

          <p>Prominent intellectuals and mainstream media outlets are increasingly drawing parallels between the current state of Western nations, particularly Britain, and the late Soviet Union of the 1980s. This article explores arguments suggesting a similar political rigidity, a pervasive fear of questioning obsolete dogma, and a managerial class that seems to ignore impending systemic changes. While the ultimate historical accuracy of these comparisons is yet to be determined, the author stresses that such warnings demand serious consideration. The potential decline of the West, even without outright collapse, carries significant implications for global stability and warrants critical reflection on institutional adaptability.</p>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, is advocating for improved accessibility within the Houses of Parliament, describing parts of the building as "inaccessible to me." She highlighted issues like heavy doors, difficult door handles, and the distance to accessible toilets, despite the Equalities Act being passed 15 years ago within the same complex. Tidball, who missed years of school due to surgeries, believes the composition of Parliament should reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. The House of Commons Modernisation Committee is addressing these concerns, with a report and plans for bigger changes due later this year.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning of a surge in Vibrio vulnificus infections, a bacterial pathogen thriving in warm, low-salinity waters, with rising temperatures and warming seas identified as the primary culprits. Vibriosis, often contracted through raw shellfish consumption or open wounds in affected waters, has historically been associated with the Gulf Coast but is now appearing further north on the East Coast. The CDC reports a frightening 1 in 5 fatality rate, sometimes within days of illness, and can lead to necrotizing fasciitis. Health officials advise avoiding raw shellfish and swimming with open wounds in warm waters to mitigate risk.</p>

The judge's intervention came after lawyers argued the expedited deportations would bypass legal protections for minors, potentially exposing them to abuse or persecution upon return. The Justice Department claimed the repatriations were requested by the Guatemalan government and families, but this was disputed. The ruling, deemed "extraordinary," ensures these children remain in U.S. custody under the Department of Health and Human Services for now.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stark warning, claiming that a record $15 trillion in planned U.S. investment would be "immediately cancelled" if courts invalidate his tariff policies, leading the nation to become a "Third World Nation." This statement follows a U.S. appeals court ruling that deemed his administration's broad use of tariffs unconstitutional, stating the Emergency Powers Act does not explicitly grant such authority. Trump has consistently argued tariffs generate "trillions" and are vital for national strength. Economists, however, note the ruling focuses on executive authority, not the economic merits, and suggest Congress could still approve tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
