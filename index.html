          <p>Despite securing major trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing record low approval ratings, particularly among Labour voters, with many expressing unfavorable views of his leadership. While the government touts its success on trade deals, British voters remain concerned about cost-of-living pressures, exacerbated by a higher-than-expected inflation rate of 3.5% in April, and businesses grapple with tax increases. Critics suggest Starmer's lack of charisma and perceived anti-growth domestic policies are contributing to his unpopularity, despite positive developments in foreign policy, while business leaders remain optimistic about the government's overall direction. The article explores the disconnect between economic progress and public perception of the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine conducted a major prisoner exchange, releasing hundreds of soldiers on both sides, marking a rare moment of cooperation amidst ongoing conflict. The exchange occurred shortly after Kyiv experienced a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack, resulting in casualties and damage to residential areas, including a student dormitory. Both sides have agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees, and further releases are anticipated, though the attacks underscore the continued need for increased sanctions pressure on Moscow to accelerate the peace process. Despite the prisoner swap, battles continue along the front line, and both countries remain far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in the UK's rail industry. The government hails this move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure, although it refrained from promising lower fares. SWR trains are now under the responsibility of the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure pending parliamentary approval. The Transport Secretary described the nationalization of SWR as a "real watershed moment," emphasizing the government's commitment to providing passengers with "great value for money."</p>

          <p>South Western Railways in the UK has been returned to public ownership, marking the first step in the Labour government's plan to renationalize the country's rail services. The move is intended to improve services and save compensation fees paid to rail operators, ending what the government describes as "30 years of fragmentation." While the first service under public ownership was a rail replacement bus, the nationalization aims to address issues such as frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. The Labour government plans to bring all 14 rail operators under public control by 2027.</p>
