          <p>Three former senior managers at the Countess of Chester Hospital, where nurse Lucy Letby murdered seven babies, have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. The arrests are part of a wider investigation into potential corporate manslaughter and the hospital leadership's response to the increased infant mortality rate between 2015 and 2016. These developments are separate from Letby's ongoing efforts to appeal her convictions, which are supported by some politicians and a panel of medical experts who have re-examined the trial evidence.</p>

          <p>A viral social media post claiming to show an Iranian missile strike on Israel's Weizmann Institute has been proven false by a DW Fact Check. A reverse image search revealed the satellite photo actually depicts an Iranian missile base in Tabriz that was damaged by an Israeli attack, a fact verified by coordinates and visual evidence from Maxar Technologies. The article clarifies that while the Weizmann Institute was a target in Iran's retaliatory strikes, the widely circulated image is being used to spread misinformation by misrepresenting the event.</p>

The controversial center, located at a remote airport, is designed to house up to 5,000 individuals for processing and deportation, with officials touting its isolation as a key security feature.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where individuals misjudge public opinion and remain quiet, thereby reinforcing the status quo. It argues that a key function of public protest is to break this spiral by providing a visible signal of collective belief, which helps people more accurately perceive the views of their fellow citizens. Citing research on public reactions to Supreme Court rulings like Dobbs and Obergefell, the analysis shows how widespread demonstrations can correct false social realities and build common knowledge.</p>

          <p>In response to growing confusion and fear among doctors, several Republican-led states are passing legislation to "clarify" the medical exceptions in their strict abortion bans. States like Texas and Tennessee are specifying conditions that qualify for a legal abortion, such as ectopic pregnancies, and removing requirements that a threat to the patient's life be "imminent." However, many abortion rights advocates and medical groups argue these clarifications are insufficient and politically motivated, failing to resolve the fundamental legal risks physicians face when providing emergency care.</p>

This analysis dismisses common excuses like salary cap constraints and injuries, pointing instead to a severe collective underperformance of key players who had career-best seasons in 2024. The article also questions the club's off-field decisions, including a contract extension for the coach amid a winless streak, and notes the limited options for fixing the roster due to long-term contracts.</p>

Its passage remains uncertain as Republican leaders struggle to secure enough votes from their own party members, who are split over the extent of welfare cuts and the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national debt.</p>

          <p>The public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk has intensified, with Trump threatening to have his administration investigate the government subsidies received by Musk's companies. This threat came after Musk renewed his strong criticism of the president's "One Big Beautiful Bill," a massive spending package the billionaire has labeled as fiscally irresponsible and a form of "debt slavery." The conflict marks a sharp break between the two influential figures, who had previously maintained a close working relationship.</p>

          <p>This analysis posits that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary offers a hopeful blueprint for the progressive wing of the party. His success is attributed to a platform of practical socialist policies like a rent freeze and free childcare, a principled stance on foreign policy, and a campaign fueled by young, diverse volunteers rather than corporate money. The author argues that Mamdani's ability to mobilize voters around civic pride and economic stability, rather than fear, demonstrates a viable path forward for Democrats nationally.</p>

          <p>The article contrasts the precarious state of children's healthcare in the U.S., where programs like Medicaid and CHIP face significant budget cuts, with the system in Sweden, where access to care is a protected legal right.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has agreed to plead guilty to all charges, thereby avoiding the death penalty. According to a letter sent to victims' families, the plea deal includes four consecutive life sentences for the murder counts and will waive all rights to appeal. While the agreement ensures a conviction and spares the families from a lengthy trial and appeals process, the family of one victim expressed frustration over how the deal was handled.</p>
