        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the trial of three former Memphis police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, a cybercrime expert testified that one officer took a cellphone photo of Nichols as he struggled with serious injuries and shared it 11 times. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, died three days after a January 2023 traffic stop where he was beaten by five officers. Testimony also included details about Nichols' autopsy, the search of his car, and statements from other officers involved in the incident. The U.S. Justice Department previously concluded that the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed a minerals deal granting the U.S. preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources in exchange for the creation of a reconstruction investment fund. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that this economic partnership aims to accelerate Ukraine's recovery and help end the war. President Trump said the deal represents payback for U.S. support during the conflict, while Ukraine's Minister of Economic Development, Yulia Svyrydenko, emphasized that Ukraine retains control over extraction decisions and that the fund will be managed equally between both nations. However, some analysts view the deal as potentially reducing Ukraine to a dependent status.</p>

          <p>A decades-long wellness study has identified a formula for happiness centered around strong relationships. Sonja Lyubomirsky's research, along with the Harvard study of adult development, emphasizes the importance of deep trust and connection with spouses, family, and friends as predictors of well-being. Robert Waldinger's TED Talk on the subject has garnered over 40 million views, underscoring the significance of this finding. Researchers have found that even brief social interactions can improve happiness, suggesting that overcoming reluctance to connect with others is crucial for enhancing overall life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have identified two 18th-century shipwrecks off the coast of Costa Rica as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which were shipwrecked in 1710. The ships were previously believed to be pirate vessels, but analysis of wood samples and cargo, including yellow bricks produced in Denmark, confirmed their origin and purpose. Marine archaeologist David Gregory stated that the findings align perfectly with historical accounts of one of the ships burning. The discovery provides missing pieces to the history of Denmark and the transatlantic slave trade.</p>

          <p>A new bill introduced by Representative Hank Johnson seeks to increase accountability for federal judges accused of misconduct, ensuring that investigations continue even if the judges retire or resign. The legislation aims to close a loophole allowing judges to collect pension benefits despite credible abuse accusations. The bill, called the Transparency and Responsibility in Upholding Standards in the Judiciary Act (TRUST), follows an NPR investigation uncovering issues with the federal judiciary's reporting system. It addresses concerns about the lack of recourse for judicial employees facing abuse, as federal courts are exempt from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, joined by some Democrats, voted to block California from implementing stricter clean air standards for trucks and a ban on gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. These votes challenge California's authority to set pollution standards that exceed federal regulations. Governor Gavin Newsom accused Republicans of prioritizing fossil fuel interests over public health. The measures now move to the Senate, where legal challenges are expected.</p>

After-tax contributions allow for additional savings beyond these limits, which can then be converted to Roth accounts for tax-free growth.

          <p>Attorneys representing clergy abuse survivors are intensifying efforts to depose Archbishop Gregory Aymond of New Orleans as a judge considers dismissing the archdiocese's bankruptcy case. The survivors' lawyers filed a motion to end the bankruptcy protection, alleging mismanagement and bad faith. They argue that Aymond's deposition is necessary to address these allegations and that dismissing the bankruptcy would allow individual lawsuits against the church. The archdiocese argues that dismissing the bankruptcy would benefit only a select few lawyers and delay potential recovery for individuals.</p>
