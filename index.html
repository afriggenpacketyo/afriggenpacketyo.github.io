          <p>President Trump announced a significant trade deal with the European Union, reached just before a looming August 1 deadline for imposing new tariffs. The agreement reportedly includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods, a substantial reduction from the threatened 30% rate. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing $600 billion in the United States. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as a "good deal" following tough negotiations aimed at rebalancing the trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has ignited discussions about the viability of the late-night television format. While Paramount cites financial pressures, with the show reportedly losing $40 million annually amid declining linear TV ad revenue, the timing has raised questions. The industry now looks to Disney's upcoming decision on Jimmy Kimmel's contract as the next major indicator for the genre's future. Despite being the highest-rated show in its time slot, Colbert's cancellation highlights the economic challenges forcing media companies to re-evaluate expensive, traditional programming.

          <h2>White House Budget Director Considers Further Spending Cuts Before September</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 14:02:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has indicated that the administration is considering more rescission packages to cut congressionally approved funding, and did not rule out doing so before September. This follows a recent $10 billion clawback, the first of its kind in decades. Vought specifically mentioned a review of Education Department and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, alleging wasteful spending. The move is viewed by Democrats as an infringement on Congress's power of the purse, creating tension as lawmakers work to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denise Huskins, whose 2015 kidnapping was initially dismissed by police as a hoax, is now collaborating with law enforcement agencies to reform interrogation techniques. Huskins, whose story was featured in the Netflix series "American Nightmare," now speaks to officers about science-based interviewing to help them better support victims and avoid false accusations. After her kidnapper was caught and she was vindicated, Huskins and her husband sued the Vallejo Police Department, reaching a $2.5 million settlement. Her advocacy work aims to turn her traumatic experience into a positive force for change in policing.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic contends that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent move to weaken his country's anti-corruption bodies was influenced by a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump. The article argues that the Trump administration has dismantled mechanisms promoting good governance abroad, signaling to global leaders that pressure against corruption is off. Zelensky's actions, which he later partially reversed after public outcry, are presented as evidence of this new paradigm. The author suggests that without U.S. leadership, the global fight against kleptocracy is weakening, leaving local civil society groups as the last line of defense.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to cease funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private organization distributing food in Gaza. Citing "grave" concerns over the GHF's methods, which involve armed contractors and have been linked to hundreds of civilian deaths, the senators are demanding a return to UN-led aid mechanisms. The letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio questions a $30 million U.S. pledge to the group amid a worsening hunger crisis.

Horneman believes a valuation correction could occur if expected interest rate cuts do not materialize and trade issues remain unresolved.

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would have "great pause" about President Trump granting a pardon to Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. His comments come after Trump's deputy attorney general met with Maxwell, fueling speculation. In contrast, Rep. Thomas Massie suggested a pardon could be considered to compel her testimony about Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, an idea opposed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna due to Maxwell's history of perjury charges. Johnson defended his decision to adjourn the House early, citing the need to protect victims' identities from uncorroborated information in the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri claimed victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, extending his championship lead after a decisive overtake on his teammate Lando Norris. The race began behind a safety car after a long delay due to heavy rain. On the first racing lap, Piastri swept past Norris and controlled the race from there, expertly managing his medium tires to the end without an additional pit stop. Norris, on a different hard-tyre strategy, finished second, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc secured the final podium position ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen.</p>

          <p>This poem, titled "Preamble to the West," by Iris Jamahl Dunkle, explores themes of forgotten history, ancestral survival, and the painful truths underlying the myth of the American West. The speaker invokes the image of a grandmother who sold a precious ring for gas, questioning how to animate this erased history against the backdrop of sanitized pioneer narratives. The poem confronts the natural desire to lie about one's past crimes, asserting that truth is the missing harmony. It concludes with a powerful call for the grandmother's story to be spoken and recognized as an emergency.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party would introduce legislation to ban all NHS doctors from striking if they win the next election. The proposal would place doctors under the same restrictions as police and the military by enforcing minimum service levels during industrial action. The move comes as resident doctors began a five-day strike over pay, which the British Medical Association (BMA) says has declined by a fifth in real terms since 2008. The BMA condemned the proposal as a "desperate intervention" and an inappropriate response for a modern democracy.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched new direct passenger flights between Moscow and Pyongyang, marking another step in the deepening relationship between the two nations. The first flight, operated by private carrier Nordwind Airlines, was scheduled to depart Sunday, re-establishing a direct air link that has been absent since the mid-1990s. This development follows the recent reopening of a direct train connection and comes amid increased diplomatic, economic, and military cooperation since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

          <p>A growing cybersecurity threat known as "quishing" involves scammers using fake QR codes to dupe people into visiting malicious websites or sharing private information. Hackers exploit the ubiquity of QR codes on everything from parking meters to utility bills, relying on a victim's sense of urgency. The FTC has issued warnings about the practice, which can lead to stolen financial data or malware being installed on a device. Experts note that as traditional email phishing becomes more difficult, criminals are increasingly turning to QR codes, with one study finding they are now used to send 26% of all malicious links.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that Israel's recent announcement of aid measures for Gaza, including airdrops and a "tactical pause," is likely a gesture to appease international allies rather than a fundamental policy shift. The article notes that the moves follow stark condemnation from the UK, France, and Germany, who have blamed Israel for the humanitarian catastrophe. The UN and other agencies have criticized Israel's previous aid system, the GHF, as inhumane and militarized. An expert from the UN's humanitarian office stated that for the new measures to be effective, Israel must significantly improve aid transit and ensure the safety of civilians.</p>

Recent earnings reports from companies like Chipotle and Hilton have reinforced this thesis, showing weakness among price-sensitive shoppers. In contrast, firms like JPMorgan and American Express, which cater to wealthier clients, have pointed to continued spending strength. (not investment advice)</p>
