Munson Medical Center confirmed it received 11 victims from the attack, though their conditions were not immediately disclosed. The Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office is leading the investigation and has asked the public to avoid the area while they continue their work.</p>

          <p>Following his passing, this article reflects on Ozzy Osbourne's significant but often overlooked role as a reality television pioneer. Before the rise of shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," MTV's "The Osbournes" offered a unique blend of celebrity life and mundane family antics, effectively creating the "reality sitcom" genre. The show, which ran from 2002 to 2005, captured a massive audience by humanizing the rock legend, portraying him as a lovable, albeit eccentric, father figure. It set a precedent for celebrity-focused reality programming that continues to influence television today.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear issue during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely removed from the Boeing 737 MAX 8. The incident, described by the airline as a maintenance issue with a tire, resulted in one person being transported for a minor injury. The FAA is investigating, and airport operations, which were briefly halted, have since returned to normal.</p>

          <p>After nearly 80 years, the remains of U.S. Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Henry J. Carlin have been identified, bringing closure to a long-standing mystery. Carlin was part of a six-member crew on a B-25C bomber that crashed in Burma in 1943. His remains, along with others, were buried unidentified until a 2022 disinterment and subsequent DNA analysis by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency confirmed his identity. He is scheduled to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England fans prepare for the Euro 2025 final, this article explores the intense physical and emotional reactions that watching sports can trigger. Psychologists explain that high-stakes games cause a surge in hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, leading to increased heart rates and a "fight or flight" response. This stress reaction is a sign of deep emotional investment and can affect behavior, sleep, and even eating habits after the match. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by reframing the anxiety as excitement and focusing on the communal joy of the experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing one of its coldest summers in decades, with average July temperatures running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system, which has allowed a low-pressure system to persist over the region, leading to increased cloud cover and cooler weather. This has also enhanced coastal upwelling, where cold ocean water is brought to the surface, further lowering land temperatures. While some residents enjoy the break from extreme heat, experts caution that the region's hottest months are often September and October.</p>

The government hopes these measures will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry.

Since winning a parliamentary majority, the opposition has blocked President William Lai's agenda and cut defense spending amid rising pressure from Beijing.

          <p>Mobile provider EE has been working to resolve a technical issue that left many customers across the UK unable to make or receive calls for several days. This follows a major outage earlier in the week that affected both mobile and landline phones, including calls to emergency services. Despite the company, owned by BT, stating that the network is "running as normal" after overnight maintenance, some customers continue to report service problems. EE has apologized for the disruption and says it is continuing to monitor the network.</p>

          <p>In a unique public relations move, actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for Astronomer, a tech company recently embroiled in a viral scandal. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert. Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a short video to address the company's newfound attention. The move is an attempt to steer the narrative away from the scandal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that both Cambodia and Thailand are seeking an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly border fighting. Trump stated he had spoken with the leaders of both nations and that talks were being arranged to de-escalate the conflict, which has killed at least 33 people. The fighting is centered on disputed territory along their shared border, particularly around the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Trump also linked future U.S. trade deals with both countries to the successful resolution of the conflict.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis by USAID officials found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza. The report, which examined over 150 incidents between October 2023 and May 2024, contradicts claims by the Trump administration and Israel used to justify restricting aid and supporting an alternative distribution system. The findings indicate that in most cases of aid loss, the perpetrator could not be identified. Both the State Department and the Israeli military have strongly disputed the report's conclusions.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has signed Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting in a major move to address their long-standing need for a prolific goalscorer. The 27-year-old arrives with an impressive record, having scored 97 goals in 102 appearances in Portugal. This article analyzes whether Gyokeres can be the final piece for Arsenal to win the Premier League after three consecutive second-place finishes. While his goal-scoring rate is elite, questions remain about whether he can replicate that success in the more competitive English league. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that one of two "military-style" grenades is missing following an explosion that killed three veteran Los Angeles County deputy sheriffs at a training facility. The sheriff stated the officers were working on the devices, which had been seized a day earlier and were believed to be inert, when one detonated. An extensive search of the area has so far failed to locate the second grenade. The incident has prompted a review of explosive handling procedures.</p>
