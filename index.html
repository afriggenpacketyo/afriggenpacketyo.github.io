          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plummeted over 7% after Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion acquisition offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. In response, Seven & i expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian company's statements, highlighting the significant hurdles foreign takeovers can face in Japan. The failed deal underscores challenges related to Japanese corporate protectionism and national security concerns for major companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Continuing the humanitarian work of his late mother, Princess Diana, Prince Harry visited Angola to support the Halo Trust's landmine-clearing efforts. He emphasized the ongoing danger that explosive remnants of war pose to civilians, particularly children, long after conflicts have ended. The visit mirrored his mother's famous 1997 walk through an Angolan minefield, which brought global attention to the cause. The Halo Trust has cleared over 120,000 landmines in the country, and the prince's involvement helps maintain focus on the critical need for continued demining operations.</p>

          <h2>Justice Department Dismisses Federal Prosecutor Maurene Comey</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 22:55:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources indicate she was dismissed under Article 2 of the Constitution, which outlines presidential powers, a move seen as politically charged. Comey was a key prosecutor in high-profile cases against Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs, and her termination follows her father's own firing by President Trump in 2017. The action adds to a series of significant leadership changes within the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and raising fears of a potential recession for the export-dependent economy. The decline was driven by weakening shipments to major partners, including an 11.4% drop in exports to the United States, exacerbated by a new 25% U.S. tariff. Automobile exports, a critical sector for Japan, have been hit particularly hard, with automakers appearing to absorb the tariff costs to maintain market share. The ongoing trade friction and lack of a breakthrough in negotiations with the U.S. are placing significant pressure on Japan's economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the administration's focus on deporting "the worst of the worst," newly obtained ICE data reveals that a small fraction of those deported have convictions for violent crimes. Of the approximately 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions, and many documented offenses were for traffic or immigration violations. This data suggests the administration's broad enforcement push has primarily affected undocumented immigrants without serious criminal records.

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant negative consequences for the markets should President Trump attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Such a move would likely trigger an equity selloff, a spike in long-term yields, and create a "mess" of legal and procedural uncertainty. Experts speculate that Powell would likely sue to prevent his removal, leading to a court battle that could reach the Supreme Court to decide if the president has the authority. The unprecedented nature of firing a Fed chair for policy disagreements is seen as a threat to the central bank's independence and overall economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts argue that E-Verify is easily fooled because it vets documents, not people, allowing fraudulent use of stolen identities to go undetected. The incident demonstrates how the system can fail to prevent the hiring of unauthorized workers while simultaneously exposing employers to raids and workers to exploitation.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of bipartisan cooperation, Congress has passed legislation to create a new safety net for veterans at risk of losing their homes. The bill addresses a crisis that emerged after the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a key homeowner assistance program, leaving thousands without affordable options to manage missed mortgage payments. The new law will allow veterans to move delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, enabling them to become current and avoid foreclosure. This fix is being praised by mortgage industry and veterans' groups as a crucial, proven method to provide stability for service members facing financial hardship.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued from a remote California forest after she cleverly left a trail of handwritten notes for search teams to follow.

The notes, which pleaded for help and provided contact information, guided rescuers directly to their location. Authorities praised the mother's resourcefulness and her crucial decision to inform someone of their travel plans beforehand, which was instrumental in initiating the successful search and rescue operation in the challenging terrain.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for illegally shutting down a key FEMA program that funds pre-disaster mitigation projects. The suit argues that the administration overstepped its authority by terminating the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a power that belongs to Congress. The states claim the "devastating" cuts jeopardize hundreds of critical infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters like floods and hurricanes. The legal action seeks to block the reallocation of the program's funds and restore the vital support for community resilience efforts across the country.</p>

          <p>An $8 billion class-action lawsuit filed by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders has gone to trial. The suit alleges that executives misled shareholders by failing to disclose the risks of user data misuse, specifically in relation to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Plaintiffs claim the company repeatedly violated a 2012 FTC consent decree, leading to massive fines and legal costs for which they are now seeking reimbursement from the executives personally. The trial, which will feature testimony from Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, will scrutinize the company's privacy practices and leadership decisions during that period.</p>

Health experts warn that social isolation is a major risk factor for dementia, heart disease, and premature death.

His remarks highlight a significant division within the Republican party on the issue.

          <p>The Trump administration's rationale for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid is facing intense scrutiny, with critics questioning the claims of widespread "waste, fraud, and abuse." Former and current officials report that the review process used to justify the cuts was superficial, targeting programs with keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than assessing their effectiveness. The former USAID inspector general stated he saw no evidence of rampant issues and that the administration has provided little proof for its assertions. This has led to accusations that the rescission is politically motivated and threatens life-saving humanitarian programs under a false pretext.</p>

A preliminary report confirmed the switches were moved but did not assign blame, noting one pilot denied doing so.

Cramer contended that with mixed economic signals, including some signs of inflation, Powell has no compelling reason to cut interest rates other than to appease political pressure.
