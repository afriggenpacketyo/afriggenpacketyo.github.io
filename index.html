          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to exit the stock market, even if it appears frothy, arguing that the current environment is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble. He stated that today's market has more rational factors, such as strong performances from companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly, which overwhelm the irrational speculation seen in some recent IPOs. Cramer suggested that while there is some irrationality, the legitimate growth in solid companies provides a stable foundation for continued investment. He believes the runs in good stocks can't happen without some speculation in others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are holding a summit in Alaska to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. Experts note the historical significance of the meeting's location, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was excluded from the talks, insists that any decisions made without Kyiv's input will be invalid. The meeting is seen by some as a major diplomatic opportunity for Putin to influence Trump's strategy for the conflict. There are mixed expectations, with some observers fearing Putin will deceive Trump, while others see a slight possibility of moving closer to a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined an emergency request to block a Mississippi law requiring parental consent for minors to use popular social media platforms. The tech industry group NetChoice had challenged the law, arguing it violates First Amendment free speech protections. While the law can now be enforced, the case will continue in lower courts and is expected to return to the Supreme Court for full consideration. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, suggested the law is likely unconstitutional but agreed that NetChoice did not meet the high standard required for emergency relief at this stage.</p>

          <p>The California Coastal Commission has voted unanimously to oppose SpaceX's proposal to nearly double its rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base to 95 per year. The commission cited significant environmental concerns, including the impact of sonic booms on wildlife and residents, and questioned whether the launches primarily serve commercial purposes rather than federal government needs. Although the vote does not halt SpaceX's activities, as the company operates as a federal contractor, it represents a formal objection from the state regulator. The commission has urged the Air Force to conduct more thorough environmental monitoring.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their summit in Alaska, an analysis of past meetings between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin reveals key aspects of their relationship and diplomatic styles. Their interactions, from their first meeting at a 2017 G20 summit to later talks in Helsinki, have often been marked by mutual admiration despite underlying political tensions. Former officials note Putin's tendency to dominate conversations with lengthy monologues and Trump's more freewheeling, less-prepared approach. Experts suggest Putin will likely use his KGB training to try and manipulate Trump, who believes a strong personal relationship is key to state-to-state relations.</p>

Ouattara had a successful season with the Cherries, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances across all competitions. This move comes after Brentford's previous bid for another player was rejected, and after Nottingham Forest, another interested party in Ouattara, pursued a different target.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, a 21-year-old Washington woman accused of fatally shooting U.S. Border Patrol agent David Maland in Vermont. A grand jury indicted Youngblut on a murder charge for the January incident, which occurred during a traffic stop and also resulted in the death of her companion. The shooting is reportedly linked to the Zizians, a cult-like group associated with several deaths across three states. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti stated that such attacks on law enforcement will not be tolerated by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>As economic growth slows and spending in major Chinese cities tightens, the country's smaller, lower-tier counties are emerging as a new engine for consumption. Residents in these areas often have lighter economic burdens, faster income growth, and greater confidence, leading to stronger purchasing power. This expanding middle class is fueling a consumption upgrade, purchasing items like Teslas and imported goods through robust e-commerce networks. Experts believe the consumption potential in these previously overlooked markets is largely untapped, offering a path for China to shift its economy toward a more consumption-driven model.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, dropped nearly 16% after it announced that U.S. tariffs will significantly impact its profits in the coming fiscal year. The company projects that higher duties will cost it $160 million, leading to a full-year earnings forecast below Wall Street expectations. The financial headwinds are partly due to the suspension of the de minimis rule, which had allowed items under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. Despite the profit warning, Tapestry still expects low single-digit revenue growth for the year.</p>

          <p>Ulta Beauty and Target have announced the end of their partnership, which placed Ulta shops inside hundreds of Target stores and on its website. The deal, which began in 2021 and established over 600 in-store locations, will conclude in August 2026. For Target, the loss of the popular beauty brand could be another challenge as it struggles with declining sales and store traffic. Analysts suggest that issues with Target's in-store operations and staffing may have contributed to the decision, creating another problem for the retailer's next CEO to address.</p>

          <p>A group of prominent religious leaders in Washington, D.C., has strongly criticized President Trump's decision to implement a federal takeover of the city's police force. They condemned the president's rhetoric, in which he described the city as being "overrun" by criminals, as inflammatory and dehumanizing. The leaders argued that such fear-based governance is counterproductive and that true safety comes from long-term collaboration and addressing root causes of crime like addiction and mental health issues. They called on political leaders to reject what they termed "political theater" and work together with dignity and respect.</p>

After signing with the Kansas City Chiefs and later the Jacksonville Jaguars, he was unable to secure a breakthrough and has decided to come back to rugby.

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, its trust funds are projected to face a shortfall that could lead to benefit cuts within a decade. According to trustees, the program may only be able to pay about 77% of scheduled benefits starting in 2033 unless Congress intervenes. Lawmakers are considering various reform proposals, including a bipartisan plan to create a new $1.5 trillion investment fund to cover the shortfall. Another proposal focuses on increasing taxes on high earners to fund benefit enhancements, reflecting a public desire for legislative action to ensure the program's long-term solvency.

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, retirees are increasingly considering annuities to create guaranteed income streams, raising the question of whether owning multiple annuities is a wise strategy. It is possible to own several annuities to diversify and leverage different features, such as combining a fixed annuity for stable income with a variable one for growth potential. However, this approach increases complexity, fees, and paperwork. Prospective retirees must carefully coordinate liquidity, manage varied tax implications, and weigh the benefits of diversification against the added administrative burden.

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending more aggressive and earlier treatment. Under the new advice, individuals with systolic blood pressure in the 130-139 range should first adopt lifestyle changes; if those are ineffective after three to six months, medication is recommended. A significant change from the 2017 guidelines is the new recommendation to abstain from alcohol, citing growing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure.

          <p>Ukrainians and their European allies are reportedly appalled by the diplomatic summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, viewing it as a naive and poorly handled affair. Many in Ukraine feel let down, believing Trump is being manipulated by Putin and is failing to hold Russia accountable for its invasion. The Ukrainian government is seeking a ceasefire, security guarantees, and reparations, but there is little confidence these goals will be achieved. Critics point to the lack of Russia specialists in Trump's delegation as evidence that he is unprepared for negotiations with Putin's experienced team.</p>

While soldiers meticulously prepare pallets of aid for delivery, the process is wildly inefficient and costly compared to overland truck deliveries, which remain heavily restricted. On the ground, the airdrops create chaos and desperation, as only the strongest can secure the scattered supplies, often leading to deadly scrambles.

For Trump, the primary motivation appears to be positioning himself as a global peacemaker, a legacy he has openly desired, though his vacillating statements have made his precise aims unclear. While Trump hopes for a breakthrough, Putin may offer a superficial concession that allows Trump to claim progress while advancing Russia's own strategic terms.</p>
