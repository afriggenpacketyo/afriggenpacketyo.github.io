          <p>An independent report concerning BBC's MasterChef has substantiated 45 allegations against presenter Gregg Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate sexual and racist comments. The inquiry, initiated by production company Banijay after a BBC News investigation, reviewed 83 total claims. In response to the findings, both Banijay and the BBC issued apologies for failing to address the behavior sooner and confirmed they have no future plans to work with Wallace, who was recently dismissed from the show.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a significant overnight attack on Ukraine, deploying 136 drones and four missiles across the country, with Ukrainian air defenses neutralizing 108 of the drones. The assault occurred as President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would provide Kyiv with more Patriot surface-to-air missile systems to bolster its defenses. Trump specified that while the U.S. would send the crucial defensive equipment, the European Union would be responsible for the payment, reinforcing his "peace through strength" approach.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the U.S. government's reliance on outdated technology and legacy vendors creates a critical vulnerability that adversaries like China are exploiting. The author, a Navy veteran, contends that entrenched bureaucracy and resistance to change prevent the adoption of innovative commercial technologies. To maintain its strategic edge in areas like AI and cybersecurity, the government must break free from vendor lock-in and embrace the agility and continuous improvement of the commercial sector.</p>

          <p>A growing healthcare movement known as "social prescribing" involves doctors prescribing community activities like art classes, exercise groups, or nature exposure to improve patient well-being. This approach complements traditional medicine by addressing loneliness and promoting healthy habits, focusing on "what matters to you" rather than just "what's the matter with you." Studies and patient experiences show significant benefits, including better management of chronic diseases like diabetes, improved mental health, and reduced healthcare costs, with programs now active in around 30 countries.</p>

Analysts note this initiative differs significantly from the 2015 supply-side reforms, which targeted state-owned heavy industries. Today, China faces a weaker economy, a market dominated by private firms, and limited government funds, making it more challenging to regulate low-price competition and manage the orderly exit of outdated production capacity across various sectors.
