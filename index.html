          <p>Following days of clashes between protesters and law enforcement due to immigration enforcement operations, President Trump ordered the National Guard to Los Angeles, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as inflammatory. Protests escalated with demonstrators clashing with federal agents, vandalizing Waymo vehicles, and blocking freeways. ICE stated that the operations resulted in arrests, including a "domestic abuser" and a "child sexual assaulter," while officials like Maxine Waters condemned the deployment as disruptive. The situation remains tense, with ongoing debate over the federal government's role in local law enforcement and the rights of protesters.</p>

Thunberg and others aimed to protest Israel's blockade and wartime conduct, but were stopped in international waters. This incident follows previous attempts by the Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza, highlighting ongoing tensions and the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles amidst protests over immigration raids, calling it an abuse of power. The board argues that local law enforcement had the situation under control, and Governor Newsom opposed the deployment, deeming it inflammatory. The editorial highlights the historical context of federalizing the National Guard over a governor's objections, noting the last instance was during the civil rights movement. The board contends that Trump's actions are creating chaos rather than preventing it, and that the situation does not constitute a rebellion against the U.S. government.</p>

Despite government stimulus measures, sluggish consumption and trade tensions with the U.S. continue to weigh on the economy.

          <p>Almost 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, with the possibility of strikes looming. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the award as inadequate, citing over a decade of pay erosion and rising numbers of nurses quitting. The vote is crucial in determining the next steps, potentially including a ballot for strike action. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action over pay, casting a shadow over the government's 10-year plan for the NHS.</p>
