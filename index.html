          <p>Hamas has submitted a response to the latest US-backed ceasefire proposal, describing it as positive and expressing readiness for immediate negotiations. However, the group has requested several amendments, including a US guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail. The proposal reportedly involves a phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations and Palestinian casualties continue, underscoring the urgency of reaching a final agreement.</p>

          <p>A software engineer named Soham Parekh has gained notoriety after being exposed for simultaneously working for multiple tech startups, a practice some are calling an extreme example of "hustle culture." While some in the tech community criticized the ethics of his actions, others were intrigued by his ability to manage several roles, a phenomenon known as "overemployment" that has grown with remote work. In an interview, Parekh admitted to the arrangement, citing dire financial necessity rather than greed, and noted the grueling lifestyle it required. The incident highlights a broader conversation about job security and employee-employer dynamics in the tech industry.</p>

          <p>A recent emotional display by a UK politician has reignited the debate over whether crying at work is professionally damaging or simply a human response. The article explores various perspectives, with some viewing it as a sign of weakness, particularly in male-dominated fields, while others see it as a mark of emotional intelligence and strength. Career coaches suggest that employers who respond with compassion are more likely to foster motivated and happier staff. Ultimately, while some bias against workplace emotion persists, many now argue that authenticity and the ability to handle complex emotions are valuable leadership traits.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations against deportations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles led to multiple arrests on Friday following clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The Los Angeles Police Department reported that while most demonstrations were peaceful, some "outside agitators" caused issues as the evening progressed. Federal authorities reportedly deployed less-lethal munitions after demonstrators confronted Federal Protective Security Personnel and National Guard members. The protests are part of ongoing opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies, which have included the deployment of National Guard troops to the city.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has established himself as a key operative in the Trump administration, playing a crucial role in advancing the president's legislative and foreign policy agendas. He was instrumental in navigating a major tax and spending bill through Congress, personally negotiating with holdouts and casting tie-breaking votes in the Senate. Vance has also become a prominent defender of Trump's foreign policy decisions, including those concerning Iran and Yemen, despite his previous non-interventionist stance. This active, multi-faceted role aligns with expectations that he would serve as the president's "eyes and ears" and a potential MAGA successor.</p>

          <p>The appointment of registered nurse Vicky Pebsworth to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee has sparked controversy due to her long-standing, publicly expressed belief that vaccines caused her son's autism, a claim refuted by extensive scientific research.

Critics, including medical experts, worry that her personal beliefs and association with anti-vaccine organizations will compromise the committee's scientific integrity.

          <p>An opinion article from a Tehran-based researcher argues that Israel's recent attacks on Iran, and the perceived tacit support from Western nations, have profoundly damaged any remaining trust in the West among the Iranian populace. The author observes that while many Iranians dislike their government, the aggression has fostered a sense of national unity and patriotism against foreign intervention. The West's response, seen as hypocritical and indifferent to Iranian lives, has fueled anger and even increased support for Iran developing a nuclear deterrent. This erosion of trust may irreparably harm the West's ability to act as a credible mediator in the region.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced it will begin including data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans in some of its credit score models, a significant change reflecting the payment method's growing popularity. This move is intended to provide lenders with a more complete financial picture of consumers, potentially preventing them from offering more credit than a person can afford. For consumers, this means that making on-time BNPL payments could help build their credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their score. Consumer advocates note that while this adds transparency, BNPL services still lack some of the consumer protections offered by traditional credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

While the White House promotes the bill as a catalyst for economic growth, polls indicate it is unpopular, and Democrats hope to capitalize on the tangible impact of healthcare cuts.

The long-standing relationship between Trump and UFC CEO Dana White has provided the president with a platform to celebrate a brand of machismo and defiance.

          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the site of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility on Tuesday left seven people unaccounted for, and officials are now working to identify the remains.

          <p>Several prominent LA Galaxy supporter groups, including the Angel City Brigade, staged a protest during the team's July 4th match to voice their frustration with the club's silence on recent ICE raids in Southern California. Fans displayed banners with messages like "Stop the Raids" and "Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants" before walking out of the stadium in the 12th minute. The groups, whose fanbases are largely Latino, feel the team has failed to support its community, especially in contrast to other Los Angeles sports teams that have spoken out. The protest highlights the growing expectation for sports franchises to engage with social and political issues affecting their supporters.</p>

          <p>Despite attracting over a million people, Pride in London and other Pride events across the UK are facing significant financial challenges due to a drop in corporate sponsorships and volunteer numbers. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that a majority of organizations have seen reduced funding, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or begin charging for previously free events. Organizers attribute the decline to a pullback in corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) budgets, particularly from US-based companies. While the movement remains resilient, the current financial climate poses a serious threat to the scale and accessibility of these vital community celebrations.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in the journal *Science*, identified a "genetic switch" that controls organ regeneration, which they were able to reactivate. The scientists found that the mice's inability to regenerate was linked to a failure to produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this pathway, they achieved complete restoration of the lost tissue, offering hope that this mechanism could one day be applied to help regenerate organs in humans.</p>

The 18-year-old Brazilian, who will join Chelsea next season, scored a brilliant equalizing goal for Palmeiras, showcasing the skill that prompted the London club to sign him for a potential £52m fee. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca called Estêvão a "huge talent" and a "fantastic player," acknowledging the need to help him adapt to European football.

          <p>Taiwan's new administration under President William Lai is facing criticism for its approach to commemorating the Republic of China's (ROC) role in World War II. Critics, particularly from the opposition KMT party, accuse the government of selectively honoring the ROC's wartime victory while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This reflects the ruling DPP's broader political stance, which emphasizes Taiwan's distinct identity, separate from the mainland. The debate highlights the ongoing political and historical complexities surrounding Taiwan's identity and its relationship with the ROC's pre-1949 legacy.</p>

The author points to tactics like the use of military force on domestic protesters, loyalty tests, anti-intellectualism, and self-aggrandizing projects as echoes of regimes led by figures like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The article posits that since the US supported many of these autocrats as anti-communist allies, it is a startling reversal to see the US now imitating their authoritarian models.</p>
