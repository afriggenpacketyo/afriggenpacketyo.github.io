          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 18:02:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has recommended a one-day prison sentence for Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer convicted of civil rights violations during the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor. Hankison fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment, though none struck her, with some bullets entering a neighboring unit. The DOJ's sentencing memo argued that a lengthy sentence would be "unjust," a position that has drawn sharp condemnation from Taylor's family attorneys, who called it a betrayal of justice and a dangerous precedent. A federal judge will make the final sentencing decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts anticipate that the fentanyl crisis will become a significant item on the U.S.-China trade agenda after a prolonged absence from bilateral discussions. The issue is viewed as a potential "third stage" in negotiations, leveraging a critical U.S. national security and public health concern to potentially ease broader economic tensions. Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Addressing its trafficking could foster greater cooperation and potentially relax trade frictions between the two global powers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Officials Tour Alcatraz to Assess Reopening as Federal Prison</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 17:56:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured Alcatraz Island as part of the Trump administration's initiative to convert the historic site back into a federal penitentiary. The plan, announced by President Trump, aims to house the nation's most violent offenders in a rebuilt and enlarged facility. The proposal has been met with strong criticism from California officials, including San Francisco's mayor and Nancy Pelosi, who cited prohibitive costs and the loss of a major tourist attraction that generates significant revenue. Alcatraz was closed in 1963 due to its high operational expenses.</p>

          <p>Bryan Braman, a former linebacker who won Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles, has passed away at the age of 38 following a battle with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. Braman, who also played for the Houston Texans, was remembered by former teammates and the Eagles organization as a loyal and devoted father. His death highlights a concerning trend of increasing cancer diagnoses in individuals under 50, with experts noting that causes are likely multifactorial, involving lifestyle, genetics, and environmental exposures.</p>

          <p>Amazon is implementing another round of layoffs, this time affecting some employees in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division, including the training and certification unit. The company stated the cuts are part of an ongoing effort to streamline operations and refocus on key priorities, rather than a direct result of AI investments. This move is consistent with CEO Andy Jassy's broader cost-cutting strategy, which has seen over 27,000 jobs eliminated since 2022. The company noted it continues to hire in other strategic areas within AWS.</p>

This shift suggests that ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be rerouting global supply chains through other economies. While Brazil's total exports to China decreased, the significant increase in rare earth compounds highlights China's strategy to diversify its access to critical resources.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and state Democrats are threatening to redraw the state's congressional districts in a bid to gain more seats for their party. This controversial proposal is a direct response to a Republican plan in Texas, prompted by Donald Trump, to gerrymander its own maps to secure more GOP seats. The California plan faces significant legal and political hurdles, as the state's redistricting power was given to an independent commission by voters over a decade ago.

While generally benign, doctors must first rule out more serious causes like heart disease or blood clots using tests like ultrasound exams.

          <p>Ian Cleary has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a fellow Gettysburg College student in 2013, a case that gained new life after he sent the victim a Facebook message in 2019 stating, "So I raped you." Cleary, who was extradited from France last year, now faces a potential sentence of four to eight years in prison. The victim, Shannon Keeler, has been a public advocate for her case for over a decade, pushing authorities to pursue charges. The plea marks a significant development in a long and arduous journey for justice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced new rules giving Interior Secretary Doug Burgum final review power over all federal permitting aspects for wind and solar projects on U.S. lands. The Interior Department claims this move is "levelling the playing field" with fossil fuels, but renewable energy industry groups have condemned it as politically motivated obstruction. Critics argue the added layers of bureaucracy will slow the growth of clean energy production at a time when demand is increasing. This action follows other administration efforts to roll back incentives for the renewable sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has launched a sustained social media campaign criticizing President Trump and his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. On his platform X, Musk has repeatedly posted and reposted content suggesting a cover-up, questioning the administration's claim that no client list exists and mocking Trump's dismissal of the issue as a "hoax." The attacks mark a renewed focus on the topic for Musk, who previously feuded with the president after stepping down from a government efficiency role.

According to the agreement, ICE will use the data, which includes addresses and social security numbers, to locate immigrants for enforcement actions. The move has been condemned by critics like Rep. Pramila Jayapal as a "weaponization of data" and a betrayal of privacy, as it could deter people from seeking necessary medical care.

Officials stated there was no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis, and an echocardiogram showed normal heart function.

Johnson was convicted of wire fraud for allegedly 'front-running' a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client, a practice he and industry groups maintained was a standard risk-management technique known as 'pre-hedging.' After serving time in both U.S. and UK prisons, Johnson was granted a full acquittal following a 2023 court decision that overturned the specific law used in his prosecution.

          <p>This article explores the history of air travel, challenging the popular notion of a mid-century "golden age" of glamour. While early flight was a source of wonder, it was also dangerous and uncomfortable, with unpressurized cabins and loud engines. Even as mass travel began post-war, the experience was expensive, more dangerous than today, and plagued by issues like segregation and, later, jet lag. The essay argues that the perceived glamour was more about the revolutionary idea of flight itself than the actual in-air experience, which has always been characterized by a series of trade-offs and indignities.</p>
