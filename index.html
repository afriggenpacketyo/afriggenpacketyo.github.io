          <p>Eleven inmates, deemed armed and dangerous, escaped from a New Orleans jail early Friday morning. Authorities discovered their absence during a routine headcount. One inmate was quickly apprehended using facial recognition technology after trying to flee on foot, but the remaining escapees are believed to still be in New Orleans. The Orleans Parish Jail is on lockdown, and a search involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies is underway to return the inmates to custody. Police are notifying victims of the escapees, some of whom face murder charges, and have relocated one family for their safety.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has significantly increased his presence in Washington, D.C., becoming a prominent figure in the MAGA movement. Since his father's election, he has joined several corporate boards and advisory committees, leveraging his family name for business ventures. He co-founded an exclusive private club called "Executive Branch" with a hefty membership fee, raising concerns about potential pay-to-play culture. Trump Jr. defends his activities, stating he is a private citizen and businessman providing for his family. Critics argue that he is cashing in on his father's presidency, while allies claim his high membership fees deter influence peddling.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an image on Instagram that was interpreted by some as a call for violence against President Trump. The image, showing seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," was seen by administration officials as a reference to removing the 47th president. Comey deleted the image and claimed he didn't realize the numbers' violent associations. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the issue is under investigation, while President Trump accused Comey of knowing exactly what the post meant and calling for his assassination.</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to objections from Republican hard-liners. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, arguing that the savings in the legislation don't take effect until after Trump leaves office. This move is a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump, who had called on Republicans to unite behind the bill. House Republican leaders will continue negotiations to address the concerns of the holdouts.</p>

          <p>Chad's former prime minister, Succes Masra, was arrested for allegedly inciting hatred that led to deadly clashes, resulting in the deaths of dozens. Masra's party claims he was "kidnapped" by the judicial police, while the public prosecutor stated he is being investigated for inciting hatred, complicity in murder, and desecration of graves. The investigation points to Masra's involvement in a clash that killed 42 people in the southwest province of Logone Occidental. Masra previously served as premier under President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno.</p>

The Penn Wharton Budget Model found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall beginning in 2026. The plan to slash federal spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps could disproportionately affect the poorest.
