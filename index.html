          <p>French scientists have discovered a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, naming it "Gwada negative." The discovery occurred 15 years after receiving the woman's blood sample for routine surgery tests. The French Blood Establishment (EFS) announced this as the 48th blood group system, officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The woman, now 54 and living in Paris, inherited the mutated gene from both parents and is the only known person compatible with herself, with scientists hoping to find others with the same blood type to improve care for patients with rare blood types. The discovery of new blood groups, accelerated by DNA sequencing, enhances the level of care for patients with rare blood types. </p>

          <p>Jack Draper's bid for the Queen's title ended in a semi-final defeat against Jiri Lehecka, with Draper struggling with tonsillitis. Despite feeling unwell, Draper insisted on playing, driven by his childhood dream of reaching the final on home soil. After losing the first set, he battled back to win the second, but Lehecka secured a crucial break in the third, leading to Draper smashing his racquet in frustration. Draper, who was diagnosed with tonsillitis on Friday, will now rest before preparing for Wimbledon, which begins on June 30, as he remains determined despite his health setback.</p>

          <p>This week, the stock market experienced minimal fluctuations despite significant geopolitical events and Federal Reserve updates. The intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran caused investors to monitor safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as risk assets like oil. The Fed decided to keep interest rates unchanged, considering lackluster consumer and housing market data alongside lower-than-expected inflation. While the Fed anticipates two rate cuts in 2025, some officials suggest starting as early as July to prioritize labor market resilience, but investors are encouraged to focus on individual company fundamentals and industry trends rather than higher-level dynamics.

          <p>A pilot died in a plane crash near Sugar Valley Airport in Mocksville, North Carolina, after attempting to avoid a turtle on the runway. According to a preliminary NTSB report, the pilot raised a wheel after landing to avoid the turtle, leading to the crash that killed him and a passenger, while seriously injuring another. Witnesses reported seeing the pilot raise the right wheel, after which the plane rocked, took off again, and crashed in a heavily forested area near the runway. The NTSB's final report, which will include the probable cause of the accident, is expected in one to two years.</p>

While Gamboa did not fire his weapon, witnesses claim he was moving toward the crowd with it raised, but the circumstances surrounding the incident remain uncertain, prompting police to seek video footage.

          <p>Hundreds of journalists at Voice of America (VOA) have been fired by the Trump administration, effectively shutting down the US-funded news outlet. The layoffs, affecting most of the remaining staff, are attributed to the administration's claim that the agency is "riddled with dysfunction, bias, and waste." Kari Lake, appointed by Trump to run VOA, announced the layoffs, stating that over 85% of the agency's employees have lost their jobs since March, leaving only 50 employees across VOA, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, and the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). This move has been criticized as the death of independent journalism that upholds US ideals of democracy and freedom.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island criticized President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested Trump is disavowing the intelligence community for political reasons, especially as he contemplates potential military action against Iran. National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified weeks ago that Iran has not authorized a nuclear weapons program since suspending it in 2003, and Reed believes Trump's stance is influenced by his desire to justify a potential attack. Reed emphasized the need for immediate correction if Gabbard's testimony was false, rather than dismissing it after Israeli actions.</p>

          <p>Former Scotland captain and British and Irish Lions great Ian McLauchlan has died at the age of 83. McLauchlan, known as 'Mighty Mouse,' led his country 19 times and was celebrated for his fearsome scrummaging. He played a crucial role in successful Lions tours to New Zealand and South Africa in the 1970s, and he was inducted into Scottish Rugby's Hall of Fame in 2013, later receiving an OBE in 2017. Scottish Rugby expressed immense sadness at his passing, recognizing his significant contributions to the sport.</p>

          <p>Despite publicly condemning Israel's attacks on Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have indirectly intervened in the conflict. Jordan shot down Iranian missiles and drones to protect its airspace, while Saudi Arabia likely allowed Israel to use its airspace for defense, although both countries have expressed opposition to Israel's actions. This intervention highlights the complex balancing act these nations face, given domestic tensions and historical antipathy towards Israel. Both countries also have concerns about Iran's destabilizing influence in the region, which makes their positions all the more delicate.</p>

          <p>Speculation about regime change in Iran is growing as Israel's attacks continue, but experts warn of the disastrous consequences historically associated with foreign-imposed regime change. The concept violates international law, often leads to power vacuums, violence, and instability, and newly installed governments struggle to resolve the country's problems. Examples from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya illustrate the potential for long-term conflict and devastation following regime change efforts, and experts suggest that a ground force would be required to force a change of government in Iran. This consideration highlights the complex and potentially dangerous implications of regime change in the region.</p>

The vessel will be transported to Termini Imerese for investigators to determine the cause of the sinking, as Italian authorities conduct a criminal investigation. The recovery operation involved slowly raising the yacht from 165 feet below the surface, requiring specialized divers and equipment due to the depth.

Senator Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar confronted Lee, leading to him deleting the posts, and Smith's deputy chief of staff sent a message expressing the additional pain caused by Lee's remarks.

          <p>Steve Bannon, despite holding no official position, has been playing an outsized role in President Trump's decision-making process regarding Iran. Bannon advised Trump against military action, questioning the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs. Other influential conservatives, like Senator Lindsey Graham, advocate for supporting Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat, but Trump ultimately decided to hold off on a strike for at least two weeks. The influence of Bannon reflects a MAGA "America First" noninterventionist stance, and this decision has been influenced by concerns about the political repercussions of a direct attack on Iran.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say that US sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. The FDA's regulatory process, which classifies sunscreen as an over-the-counter drug, has slowed the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients, while countries like France, South Korea, and Japan have approved a wider range of ingredients. This regulatory gap has led to American sunscreens generally providing weaker UVA protection, and experts recommend wearing broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher and considering mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for the safest options.</p>

Analysts suggest that if Iran feels its existence is threatened, it may target regional oil facilities, and further political destabilization in Iran could lead to sustained higher oil prices. Historically, regime changes in major oil-producing countries have resulted in significant price spikes, potentially triggering economic recession. (not investment advice)</p>
