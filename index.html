Yan emphasizes the need to build momentum and acknowledges that a qualitative shift is yet to be achieved in cross-strait relations, while not ruling out the possibility of rapid escalation if pro-independence forces push too far.</p>

            <p>Leicester City faces relegation after a tumultuous season marked by managerial changes and declining performance. The club struggled to adapt after Enzo Maresca's departure, and subsequent managers failed to improve results. Despite some positive early impressions, the team's form deteriorated, leading to a club-record run of defeats and a severe goal drought. Growing tensions within the squad and concerns over training standards further contributed to the team's struggles, leaving the club at a crossroads.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing bipartisan criticism for the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who resided in Maryland, to a prison in El Salvador due to an "administrative error." Senator John Kennedy, a Republican, called the deportation a "screw up," while Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, described the case as a "constitutional crisis." The Trump administration has refused to bring back Abrego Garcia despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return.</p>
