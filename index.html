          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have charged a 26-year-old child care worker with over 70 offenses, including multiple counts of sexual assault against eight children. The man worked at more than 20 child care centers between 2017 and 2025, prompting fears of more victims. As a precaution, authorities have contacted 2,600 families and recommended that 1,200 children undergo testing for infectious diseases due to the nature of the alleged crimes.

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra while it reviews a petition for her removal from office. The case follows public outrage over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, which critics claim undermined national interests. This development continues a pattern of political instability in Thailand, where the court previously removed her predecessor and disbanded the progressive Move Forward party. The suspension also coincides with a separate legal case against her influential father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, is expected to enter a guilty plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors to avoid the death penalty. According to media reports citing a letter sent to the victims' families, the deal would result in a sentence of life in prison without parole. While the family of victim Kaylee Goncalves expressed anger at the decision, the father of Madison Mogen supported the deal to avoid decades of appeals. Kohberger, a former criminology student, was arrested after DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European analysts express concern that escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel, could have destabilizing effects across Africa. The Horn of Africa is considered especially vulnerable due to interconnected alliances, such as Iran's support for Houthi rebels who in turn collaborate with Somalia's Al-Shabab militia. While direct military fallout may be limited, the geopolitical effects could include trade disruptions, increased market instability, and security gaps as international attention is focused elsewhere. The conflict could also weaken the diplomatic and mediating roles of other Middle Eastern players, like Qatar, in African disputes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has issued a directive for federal attorneys to "prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings" against naturalized citizens who have committed certain crimes. A memo from Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate lists ten priority categories, including individuals linked to terrorism, human rights abuses, gang activity, and serious financial fraud. The policy aims to revoke the citizenship of those who pose an ongoing threat to the United States or who illegally procured their naturalization.

However, the jewelry category has been a notable exception, consistently outperforming other sectors like leather goods and apparel. In May, luxury jewelry spending surged over 10% year-over-year, and it was the only category to see an increase in the number of individual customers. Analysts suggest this resilience is due to jewelry's perceived value as an investment and its sentimental worth. (not investment advice)</p>

Jassy framed the transition as a way to free employees from "rote work" and make jobs more interesting, a sentiment echoed by other tech leaders.

          <p>Ryland Headley, 92, has been sentenced to life in prison for the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old widow Louisa Dunne in 1967, solving what is believed to be the UK's longest-running cold case. Headley was 34 when he broke into Dunne's Bristol home and strangled her. The case went unsolved for 58 years until a 2023 review of evidence led to new forensic testing on the victim's skirt, which produced a DNA profile matching Headley. The judge told Headley he would die in prison for the "pitiless and cruel" attack.</p>

          <p>This article explains the differences between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke, providing guidance for emergency situations. Heat exhaustion is a less severe illness with symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and can be treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. However, if left untreated, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition where the body's temperature regulation system fails, potentially causing body temperatures to rise to 41Â°C (106Â°F) and requiring immediate emergency medical attention. The best prevention is to stay hydrated and avoid midday sun.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown novel by the acclaimed German journalist and historian Sebastian Haffner has become an instant bestseller nearly a century after it was written. Titled "Parting" ("Abschied"), the autobiographical love story was penned in 1932 when Haffner was a 24-year-old law trainee witnessing the rise of fascism. The manuscript was discovered by his son after Haffner's death in 1999 but was only published recently. The book captures a sense of hope and youthful freedom against the backdrop of the impending doom of the Nazi era, offering a different perspective on the author.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" moves through Congress, Americans are anticipating how its sweeping changes will affect their lives.

Conversely, provisions like eliminating federal income tax on tips and overtime have been met with excitement by some workers, such as firefighters. The legislation also phases out green energy tax incentives, worrying small business owners in the solar industry, and includes a controversial ban on state-level AI regulation.

          <p>This article argues that the actions of the Trump administration have spurred an unprecedented and defensive form of Canadian nationalism. Faced with economic threats and questions about America's reliability as an ally, Canada is being forced to reconsider its long-held dependence on the U.S.-led global order. This new nationalism is not about cultural identity but about survival, prompting urgent questions about Canada's economic, political, and military independence. As a result, Canada is increasing defense spending, re-arming with European partners, and seeking to reduce its economic reliance on a southern neighbor it now views with deep uncertainty.</p>

DeSantis also eliminated funding for a study on high school cellphone use, a university nursing program expansion, and an innovation center at Pinellas County schools.

          <p>This essay argues that a key function of political protest is to combat the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. This silence can be misinterpreted as approval of the status quo, reinforcing the spiral. Public demonstrations, like those after the Dobbs Supreme Court ruling, can correct these misperceptions by providing a visible signal of collective opinion. By creating "common knowledge" where people see dissent and see others seeing it too, protests can reveal the true extent of public sentiment.</p>
