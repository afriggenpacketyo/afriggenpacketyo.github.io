          <p>The FBI has executed a court-authorized raid on the Maryland residence of John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor under former President Donald Trump. This action is part of a national security investigation reportedly focused on the search for classified records. The investigation was initiated by FBI Director Kash Patel, who has emphasized that no one is above the law. This event occurs in the context of previous legal battles between Bolton and the Trump administration over the publication of his tell-all memoir, which the Justice Department had previously tried to block, alleging it contained classified information.</p>

          <p>Wang Lixia, the chairwoman and deputy Communist Party chief of China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, is currently under investigation for "serious violations of discipline and laws." The probe is being conducted by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission, China's top anti-corruption bodies. Wang, who is of Mongol ethnicity, is the fourth senior official from an autonomous region to be investigated this year. This action is part of a broader, ongoing anti-corruption campaign that has targeted high-level officials across the country in recent years.</p>

          <p>As the United States signals a retreat from global clean energy investments, Chinese companies are increasing their presence in emerging markets across Asia and Latin America. These firms are embedding their proprietary technologies, such as those for solar power and electric vehicles, into local supply chains through joint ventures and infrastructure projects. This strategy not only expands China's economic influence but also promotes its technical standards, gradually aligning regional energy systems with its own. The trend is highlighted by the Trump administration's recent criticism of wind and solar power, creating a vacuum that Chinese enterprises are actively filling.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Home Office is seeking to appeal a High Court ruling that granted a local council a temporary injunction, preventing a hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers. The council argued the hotel's use posed a risk of escalating community tensions, particularly after an asylum seeker residing there was charged with sexually assaulting a teenager. The court ordered the 140 asylum seekers to be moved by September 12, a decision that could set a precedent for other councils considering similar legal action. The Home Office maintains it needs to use such accommodations in a managed way to address the asylum system's needs.</p>

The summit will bring together over 20 world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, for significant high-level discussions. This gathering provides China a platform to position itself as a major world power and leader of a bloc that offers an alternative to Western-led alliances.

          <p>A large-scale emergency response was triggered at Villanova University following 911 calls reporting an active shooter, which authorities later determined to be a "cruel hoax." The false alarm caused widespread panic during the university's opening day events, leading to a campus-wide lockdown and a significant mobilization of local, state, and federal law enforcement. No victims or evidence of a shooting were found, and the incident is now being investigated as a potential "swatting" attempt. A similar false threat was reported at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga on the same day, highlighting a concerning trend targeting educational institutions.</p>

          <p>A new Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rule making an email address mandatory for disaster aid applications is drawing criticism from current and former officials. Critics argue the policy could create significant barriers for elderly, low-income, and rural victims who may lack reliable internet access, especially in the aftermath of a disaster. This change is particularly concerning as it coincides with FEMA reducing in-person outreach and closing field offices, which previously helped bridge such technological gaps.

The piece contends that these actions often violate legal and constitutional norms and create an arbitrary, vindictive style of governance corrosive to democracy.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 100 people and seized numerous weapons, including 11 firearms and over 40 knives, in an operation to enhance safety at the upcoming Notting Hill Carnival. The intelligence-led interventions targeted individuals believed to pose a significant risk of violence, with police aiming to deter criminality at the major cultural event. In addition to the arrests, authorities will deploy Live Facial Recognition technology and screening arches at entry points.

          <p>A large-scale randomized experiment in rural Kenya by the charity GiveDirectly found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 to impoverished households led to a remarkable 48 percent reduction in infant and child mortality. The study suggests potential mechanisms for this outcome, including increased hospital births, better nutrition, and mothers working fewer hours around childbirth. However, while the life-saving effect is significant, the program's cost-effectiveness at nearly $300,000 per life saved is not competitive with other top global health interventions. The findings underscore that cash transfers have powerful benefits but may not be the most efficient tool specifically for saving lives.</p>

The image displays the aircraft from the rear with its landing gear down, featuring a design that combines the wings and fuselage for low observability. While details are scarce due to the photo's low resolution, the drone bears a resemblance to the Rainbow CH-7, a stealth reconnaissance aircraft developed by a state-owned aerospace corporation. The CH-7 was anticipated to have its maiden flight this year, and this image could be the first public glimpse of its development.</p>

          <p>In the 19 states with significant abortion restrictions following the Dobbs decision, pregnant women are facing increased health risks due to delays and confusion in emergency medical care. Doctors in these states report hesitating to perform medically necessary procedures that could be construed as abortions, fearing legal repercussions. This can lead to dangerous delays in treating conditions like ectopic pregnancies or severe hemorrhaging, with data showing increased rates of sepsis and a higher maternal mortality rate in states with bans. While laws contain exceptions for the mother's life, their vague language forces physicians to wait until a patient's condition becomes critical.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent economic interventions, such as revenue-sharing deals with corporations and pressuring companies on pricing, are prompting questions about a shift toward "state capitalism." This article explores the trend through an interview with Bhaskar Sunkara of The Nation, who distinguishes these actions from socialism. Sunkara notes that while state intervention is not inherently right or left-wing, Trump's approach appears to be ad hoc favoritism rather than a coherent long-term industrial strategy. He argues that this chaotic, self-serving use of economic tools could create a backlash that ultimately harms the country and makes future industrial policy more difficult.</p>

          <p>U.S. lawmakers and regulators are considering a test that would allow investors to qualify as "accredited" based on knowledge rather than wealth, granting them access to private investments like venture capital. Currently, access is largely restricted to individuals with high income or net worth. Experts say designing an effective test is challenging, as it must assess an investor's understanding of complex risks, including illiquidity and subjective valuations. The proposal is part of a broader push to democratize access to private assets, but it also raises significant questions about ensuring adequate investor protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has dismissed actor Noel Clarke's libel case against the publisher of the Guardian newspaper. Clarke had sued over a series of 2021 articles that contained allegations of sexual misconduct from numerous women.

In her judgment, the judge described Clarke as not being a credible witness and rejected his claim that there was a conspiracy against him.
