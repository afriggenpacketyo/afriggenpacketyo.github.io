            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has kept its loan prime rates unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, signaling a focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This decision aligns with better-than-expected economic data from China, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter, allowing the central bank to maintain steady rates. The PBOC's move was anticipated by economists, reflecting a broader strategy to balance economic growth with currency stability in the face of international trade pressures.</p>

            <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing renewed calls for his dismissal after being linked to a second group chat about sensitive military operations, reportedly shared with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The messages, sent via the Signal messaging app, are understood to have contained details of an attack on Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis in March. Despite the controversy, the White House has consistently defended Mr Hegseth, dismissing concerns and accusing "leakers" of misrepresenting the truth.</p>

With Trump raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% and China retaliating with a 125% tariff on US goods, the tariffs would cripple a Chinese airline taking delivery of a Boeing jet.</p>

The rollout of the scheme, which aims to provide 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents, has been hampered by a shortage of places and staff.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law, acting overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union.

            <p>WWF and Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences have developed AI-powered cameras to detect snow leopards and warn villagers via text message to move livestock to safety. The cameras, deployed in Gilgit-Baltistan, aim to reduce retaliatory killings of snow leopards by farmers who lose livestock to the predators. The project has faced challenges, including technical difficulties and gaining community buy-in, but shows promise in protecting the endangered species.</p>
