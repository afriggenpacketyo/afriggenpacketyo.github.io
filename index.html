          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell underwent a "very productive" interview with US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche regarding Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. Her lawyer stated she answered every question, indicating a willingness to cooperate and hoping officials would view her statements with an open mind. This high-profile meeting occurred amidst escalating public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release more files related to the late financier, despite the Justice Department previously stating no such "client list" existed. Congressional committees have also subpoenaed Maxwell for testimony, intensifying scrutiny on the ongoing investigation and raising questions about potential clemency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League clubs are dominating the summer transfer window with unprecedented spending, with Liverpool leading the outlay at £269m. Other major clubs like Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, and Tottenham have also made significant investments, with several deals exceeding £50m. Despite the high figures, football finance experts note that when "football inflation" is considered, Liverpool's spending is not as historically lavish as it appears. The article details how top clubs maintain strong financial positions through various revenue streams and adherence to profit and sustainability rules, raising questions about the league's competitiveness as a few teams account for nearly two-thirds of total summer spending.

          <h2>Expert Outlines Potential Outcomes for Ghislaine Maxwell Following DOJ Meetings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 11:02:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Ghislaine Maxwell continues her interviews with US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a legal expert suggests three possible outcomes for the convicted sex trafficker. These include a potential motion from the Department of Justice to reduce her sentence for cooperation, a defense request for reduction based on new evidence, or a presidential commutation towards the end of Donald Trump's term. Maxwell's legal team is also appealing her 2021 conviction to the Supreme Court, arguing a previous plea agreement should have protected her. These discussions occur amidst a Congressional subpoena for her testimony and persistent calls for transparency in the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Daniel Born, deputy speaker of Baden-Württemberg's parliament, resigned after admitting he drew a swastika on a ballot paper next to a far-right AfD lawmaker's name. Born called it a "serious mistake" made in "rash emotion" due to deep concern over the AfD's conduct. The incident, deemed a criminal offense by the state parliament president, has prompted a police complaint, as the use of unconstitutional symbols is punishable by law in Germany. Despite stepping down from his role and party group, Born has not relinquished his parliamentary seat, facing calls for full resignation.</p>

          <p>Many Americans claim Social Security benefits early, often out of necessity, despite knowing that delaying can significantly increase monthly payments. This article outlines three key strategies to avoid early withdrawal: investing in immediate or deferred income annuities to bridge income gaps, utilizing a reverse mortgage loan for homeowners aged 62 and older with substantial home equity, and maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and HSAs in later working years. These methods aim to provide financial flexibility, allowing individuals to defer Social Security claims and secure larger lifetime benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

Reports from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal detail the book's contents, deepening anger over the Trump administration's failure to release Epstein investigative files. Trump has vehemently denied contributing to the book, suing the Wall Street Journal for libel and barring its reporters from his trip. This ongoing "drip of evidence" continues to fuel questions about the extent of their relationship and the political fallout for the president.</p>

          <p>Germany is lagging behind global competitors like China, India, and Gulf states in capitalizing on Africa's economic dynamism and crucial raw materials, risking missed opportunities. Despite Africa's robust growth and rising demand for infrastructure and energy, German exports to the continent have stagnated for over a decade. While German companies have a good reputation for sustainable investments, experts like Christoph Kannengiesser argue that a coherent and ambitious Africa strategy is sorely lacking. Obstacles include a prevailing perception of Africa as too risky, hindering financing and diplomatic support, underscoring the need for integrated foreign trade and development cooperation.</p>

This move comes despite the Department of Justice officially shutting down the program in 2023 due to widespread criticism regarding racial bias and its ineffectiveness. Experts and over a thousand US researchers warn that reviving the initiative would deter top global talent, harm innovation, and inadvertently benefit China's own recruitment efforts, potentially weakening national security rather than strengthening it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his "media war" by filing a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over a story describing a sexually suggestive birthday note allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. This action is part of Trump's broader strategy to use courts to punish media outlets and discredit critical reporting, a tactic he has employed since his first term. The lawsuit follows his public denials of the Journal's report and the barring of its reporters from his Scotland trip. Critics view this as an attempt to control independent information and warn other news organizations.</p>

Peltola Jr.'s Piper PA-18 was nearly 120lbs over its maximum certified weight due to moose meat, and he had tied antlers to the wing strut.
