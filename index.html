          <p>Authorities have identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the "intentional act of terrorism" involving a car bomb explosion outside the American Reproductive Centers (ARC) fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. Bartkus, who died in the explosion, reportedly expressed opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The blast injured four others and damaged the clinic's office space, though the IVF lab and stored embryos remained secure. The FBI is investigating the incident, and local law enforcement is increasing patrols at fertility centers in the San Bernardino county region. The bomber tried to record video or stream the blast, according to an official speaking anonymously to the Associated Press.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has launched a "go-team" to investigate after a Mexican Navy training vessel, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge. The incident resulted in two deaths and 19 injuries among the 277 people on board. Initial reports suggest the ship lost power and drifted into the bridge during a departure maneuver, causing its masts to snap. The bridge was temporarily closed but has since reopened after inspections revealed no structural damage. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed condolences for the deceased crew members, and New York City Mayor Eric Adams offered support and gratitude to first responders.</p>

          <p>Above the Law, a legal industry website, has experienced a surge in readership by publishing leaks and criticisms of elite law firms that have made deals with President Trump. These firms, dubbed "The Yellow-Bellied Nine," pledged $1 billion in free legal work after Trump threatened them with punitive measures. The website, founded by David Lat, allows anonymous tipsters to expose internal conflicts and decisions within these firms. Joe Patrice, one of the site's writers, explores whether the site is being unfair in its coverage, ultimately concluding that the real intellectual leaders of the conservative legal movement are more incensed than they are. The site has also exposed law firms quietly stripping pronouns from email signatures and halting diversity initiatives.</p>

She believes the U.S. should increase pressure on Russia through sanctions in the energy and banking sectors to bring Putin to the negotiating table. Brink also emphasized the importance of maintaining a clear and accurate stance against aggressors and supporting a peace that keeps Ukraine free, deters Russia, and sends a strong message to China.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Walmart will "eat some of the tariffs" after President Trump demanded the company not raise prices for consumers. This assurance came after Bessent spoke with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, although a Walmart spokesperson declined to comment on the conversation. Walmart had previously announced it would need to raise prices due to the impact of Trump's tariffs on international trade. Trump criticized this position, stating the company should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to customers. Bessent believes that any price increases will not be severe, and that Walmart was simply giving a worst-case scenario during its earnings call.</p>

The National Intelligence Council determined that the Maduro regime does not direct Tren de Aragua, contradicting the Trump administration's justification for deporting suspected gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. Rubio cites an FBI assessment that supports his claim that the Venezuelan government is actively encouraging the gang to leave the country and uses them to destabilize other nations.
