          <p>Three Republican-led House committees have subpoenaed the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue, alleging it accepted fraudulent or illegal donations. Investigators claim the platform initially cooperated with their inquiry into its security practices and potential acceptance of foreign funds but has since ceased its voluntary cooperation. The subpoena demands that ActBlue provide documents related to internal misconduct and whistleblower retaliation by August 12. ActBlue has previously dismissed the probe as based on inaccuracies and asserted its commitment to security and anti-fraud measures.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage aimed at health-conscious consumers. The drink, available this fall, will feature three grams of prebiotic fiber, five grams of cane sugar, and contain 30 calories per serving. This move follows PepsiCo's recent acquisition of the popular prebiotic soda brand Poppi and reflects a broader industry trend toward functional, gut-healthy beverages. The company is also reformulating other products and introducing protein-enhanced snacks to adapt to shifting consumer preferences for healthier options.</p>

He also stated that the two nations will enhance their military cooperation. The announcement was made shortly after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. visited the White House; however, officials in Manila have not yet confirmed the details of the agreement.</p>

          <p>US House Speaker Mike Johnson has adjourned the chamber for its summer recess a day early, effectively delaying a vote on releasing documents related to Jeffrey Epstein until September. The move comes amid bipartisan pressure for transparency and follows a committee vote to subpoena Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Johnson defended the decision, accusing Democrats of political maneuvering, while the adjournment allows him time to manage divisions within the Republican party on the issue. Separately, the Justice Department has requested a meeting with Maxwell to inquire about her knowledge of the case.</p>

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's experienced a dramatic and volatile surge, at one point more than doubling before settling around 40% higher. The rally, which occurred without any specific corporate news, is being attributed to meme stock-style trading, driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. Analysts note that Kohl's exhibits characteristics of a meme stock, including high short interest and strong brand recognition. Despite the stock's wild trading, experts caution that the company's underlying business fundamentals remain weak, with falling sales and leadership instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" for keeping interest rates high, but appeared to back away from threats to fire him. Trump told reporters that Powell has done a "bad job" but noted his term would be over in about eight months anyway, seemingly dismissing the idea of removal. The comments come amid ongoing speculation about Powell's job security and legal questions over the president's authority to dismiss the central bank leader. The White House has also raised questions about a multi-billion dollar renovation project at the Fed's Washington buildings.</p>

Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, allowing people to feel less economic anxiety.

This article argues that in the Trump era, late-night shows, and Colbert's in particular, served a vital function beyond comedy.

          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old athlete and avid Peloton user, has successfully campaigned for the fitness company to add new age brackets for its oldest riders. After discovering that the competitive age categories topped out at 60-plus, Dorion launched a 14-month effort, including letters and legal assistance, to advocate for change. In response to her persistence, Peloton has now introduced 90-plus and 100-plus age categories. Dorion, a veteran of approximately 250 marathons and triathlons, continues to ride her Peloton daily and serves as an inspiration for active aging.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of completing a deal to sign striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting. The transfer, valued at approximately £63.5 million, has been delayed by negotiations over the structure of add-on payments between the two clubs. Gyokeres, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season, has already agreed to personal terms and a five-year contract with Arsenal. The signing is seen as a crucial move for manager Mikel Arteta, who has been keen to add an elite center-forward to his squad.</p>

While his supporters see him as a defender of the community against the new Syrian government, critics accuse him of escalating the conflict with a belligerent and uncompromising stance. Al-Hijri's rejection of ceasefire agreements and calls for international protection have deepened sectarian tensions.

          <p>In a detailed analysis, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen notes that nearly two years into the war initiated by Hamas's attacks, Israel is facing growing isolation as its allies lose patience with its conduct in Gaza. There is clear evidence that Israel has committed a series of war crimes, including the starvation of civilians and the disproportionate killing of tens of thousands of innocents. Western allies, including the UK and EU members, have issued strong statements condemning the suffering and the failing aid delivery system, signaling a significant shift in international posture toward the conflict.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that a growing number of retirees are heavily dependent on Social Security for their income, with two-thirds now saying they rely on it substantially, up from half in 2005. The findings highlight the program's increasing importance amid challenges like potential funding shortfalls and declining public confidence in its long-term stability. The survey also indicates that many Americans lack basic knowledge about the program, such as the optimal age to claim benefits for maximum payout. Despite concerns, 96% of Americans across all demographics agree that Social Security is an important program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that the estate of the late tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his former business partner, Sushovan Hussain, owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's software firm, Autonomy, with the court finding that the company's finances were misrepresented during the sale. Lynch, who died in a yachting accident last year, and Hussain were accused of fraudulently inflating Autonomy's value.

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic uses the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show as a lens to examine the nature of comedy under the Trump administration. It argues that comedy has become a tool of coercion, where what is considered funny is dictated by political power, and laughter is often a sign of allegiance rather than genuine amusement. The piece suggests that the project of Trumpism is to create an environment where only one perspective is validated, and jokes serve to reinforce power dynamics. This turns comedy into a serious business where you must laugh to avoid becoming the punchline.</p>
