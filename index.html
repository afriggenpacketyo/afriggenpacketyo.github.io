          <p>Following President Trump's return, new tariffs on Chinese imports have significantly increased.  A Citi research note estimates the effective tariff rate on Chinese goods is now around 65 percent,  a result of multiple tariff increases and the phasing out of duty exemptions. This substantial increase has major implications for the Chinese economy and global trade.</p>
