          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported strong first-quarter operating profits but cautioned that ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China could negatively impact global container market volumes. The company, considered a bellwether for global trade, revised its 2025 container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Maersk's CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the first quarter benefited from robust demand, but the company remains wary of the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite the revised outlook, Maersk maintained its 2025 profit guidance.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling closer economic cooperation between the two countries. The deal, teased in a social media post, would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on trading partners. While details are unclear, discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. tech companies. The agreement could offer Prime Minister Keir Starmer a political win and vindication for his cultivation of Trump.</p>

The study also highlights concerns about staffing shortages at the National Weather Service, which provided crucial early warnings.</p>
