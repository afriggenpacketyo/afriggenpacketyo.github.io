          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 15:08:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills supported by President Trump failed to pass a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives. The measure was defeated 196-223, with thirteen Republicans joining Democrats to block it, marking a significant setback for the crypto industry during its "Crypto Week" legislative push. Despite Trump's public urging for all Republicans to support the legislation, which he claimed would make America a leader in digital assets, the unexpected opposition has stalled its progress. House leadership may attempt another vote to advance the bills. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the Trump administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume selling AI chips to China involves only the company's "fourth best" technology. This strategic move aims to keep China reliant on the American technology ecosystem without providing access to top-tier chips used by U.S. companies. The resumed sale of the H20 chip, which is less powerful than Nvidia's premier models, is seen as a way to maintain a competitive edge while still profiting from the Chinese market. The policy reversal followed a meeting between President Trump and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>William "Rick" Singer, the central figure in the "Varsity Blues" college admissions scandal, has been granted permission by a federal judge to launch a new college counseling service. The ruling stipulates that Singer must prominently disclose his criminal history of bribery, fraud, and money laundering to all potential clients on his website and in writing. Singer, who was released from prison to a halfway house in 2024, has stated his intent to be transparent about his past mistakes. The new venture, named ID Future Stars, already lists him as its "Master Coach & Lead Advisor."</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, claiming the California Democrat falsely listed a Maryland property as his primary residence to secure a more favorable mortgage. Trump amplified claims, first raised by a real estate investigator, that Schiff misrepresented his residency on multiple forms over several years. Schiff has dismissed the accusations as "baseless" and a politically motivated attack intended to distract from other issues, framing it as retaliation for his role in Trump's first impeachment. A spokesperson for Schiff stated that lenders were fully aware of his circumstances as a congressman with residences in both states.</p>

Trump deflected questions about whether his name appeared in the files and baselessly claimed they were fabricated by political opponents.

While the House has already passed the measure, it faces resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about the impact on specific programs.

          <p>David Kaff, the British musician and actor known for his role as keyboardist Viv Savage in the 1984 mockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap," has passed away at the age of 79. Before his iconic film role, Kaff, who performed under the name David Kaffinetti, was a co-founder of the British prog-rock band Rare Bird. He also played piano for Chuck Berry on the live album that featured the hit song "My Ding-a-Ling." As Viv Savage, Kaff was part of the satirical heavy metal band that became a cult phenomenon, expertly parodying the excesses of the rock genre.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is set to announce a $70 billion investment plan for artificial intelligence and energy in Pennsylvania at a summit with tech and oil executives. The plan, which aims to position the state as an AI leader powered by fossil fuels, has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups. Activists argue that boosting fossil fuel production to power energy-intensive AI data centers will have severe consequences for the climate and local communities. The summit's focus on oil and gas comes despite many tech leaders, including heads of Microsoft and OpenAI, stating that affordable clean energy is essential for AI's growth.

          <p>Following President Trump's recent shift in Ukraine policy, this analysis argues that for the new approach to succeed, it must fundamentally convince Vladimir Putin that a military victory is unattainable. The article suggests that merely providing more arms or threatening tariffs is insufficient; the strategy must alter the dynamics on the battlefield itself. To achieve this, the author proposes empowering a dedicated White House team to overcome internal resistance and execute a robust plan. This would involve creative solutions for arms procurement, such as a megadeal with European allies, and a concerted effort to weaken Russia's position until a genuine peace negotiation becomes possible.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new policy to deny bond hearings to millions of immigrants facing deportation who entered the U.S. from Mexico without legal status. An internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) memo states that the administration has determined these individuals are subject to mandatory detention and may not be released from custody during their removal proceedings, which can last for years. This marks a significant shift from previous practice where such immigrants could request a bond hearing before a judge.
