          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed off the coast of South Carolina, prompting storm warnings for coastal regions of both North and South Carolina. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm to make landfall early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall of two to four inches, with localized amounts up to six inches. While some slight strengthening is possible before it reaches the coast, the storm is expected to weaken rapidly after moving inland. State emergency management divisions are on alert for potential impacts including flash flooding, gusty winds, and high rip currents through Monday.</p>

          <p>A family vacation in the Bahamas turned tragic when a 42-year-old Texas man was struck and nearly dismembered by a boat propeller while snorkeling close to shore. The boat, which was operating illegally close to the beach, fled the scene after the incident. The victim, a former Army Ranger, was airlifted to a hospital in Miami with life-threatening injuries, including multiple leg fractures and deep lacerations. His family is now seeking to identify the individuals responsible for the hit-and-run while highlighting the importance of travel medical insurance for international trips.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara's ceremonial first pitch at a Chicago Cubs game went humorously awry, prompting him to ask for a second attempt. His initial throw was wildly off-target, nearly missing the mascot catcher entirely and drawing boos from the crowd when a do-over was granted. Kamara’s second pitch was significantly better, and he celebrated with the mascot afterward. The lighthearted moment provided a brief diversion for the eight-year NFL veteran, who is expected to be a key player for the Saints in the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) reported that an F-16 fighter jet intercepted a civilian aircraft that violated restricted airspace over President Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. This was the fifth such airspace incursion reported on Saturday. The F-16 pilot performed a "headbutt maneuver" to gain the civilian pilot's attention before safely escorting the plane out of the restricted zone. NORAD has noted a recent increase in these incidents and is urging general aviation pilots to be more vigilant about checking airspace restrictions before flying.</p>

          <p>The recent devastating flood in Texas Hill Country, which killed at least 32 people, occurred in a region known as "Flash Flood Alley," one of the most dangerous areas for such events in the U.S. According to a hydrology expert, the area's steep hills, shallow soil, and unique geology contribute to rapid water runoff that can cause rivers to surge dramatically. The Balcones Escarpment, a geologic fault line, can force warm, moist air from the Gulf to rise and condense, leading to intense downpours. This article explains the geographical factors that make the region so susceptible to catastrophic flash flooding.</p>

China's firms are world leaders in the industry, and their products are deeply integrated into global supply chains. Analysts and commercial drone operators note that there are very few non-Chinese alternatives, and a ban would likely lead to significantly higher costs and operational challenges.

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage exchange, stating it is ready for further negotiations on implementation. The proposed deal reportedly involves the release of 10 living hostages and the return of 15 bodies held by the group. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declared that the changes Hamas requested to the framework are "unacceptable." Despite this, Israel will send a negotiating team to Qatar to continue talks, indicating that diplomatic efforts to halt the 20-month conflict are ongoing.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point and disqualified one of its trustees for three years. The action follows an "inflammatory and divisive" sermon delivered by trustee Harun Abdur Rashid Holmes just days after the October 7th Hamas attacks. The sermon included a hadith about Muslims fighting Jews, which the regulator found was delivered without appropriate context and at a sensitive time, amounting to mismanagement. The commission emphasized that charities should unite people, not stoke division, especially during times of conflict.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, performed 350 rescues on the July Fourth holiday due to hazardous surf conditions and strong rip currents. One particularly dangerous "monster rip current" pulled more than ten swimmers far from shore, requiring a large-scale rescue effort involving lifeboats and helicopter support. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous swimming conditions along the Southern California coast for the holiday weekend. The incident serves as a stark reminder of ocean dangers as hot weather draws large crowds to the beaches for summer holidays.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents continued to conduct raids in Southern California on the July 4th holiday, making several arrests as part of a larger operation. In West Hollywood, agents detained two longtime workers at a car wash, a move criticized by city officials as "federal overreach" on a day meant to celebrate liberty. Another raid targeted a popular food vendor in Eagle Rock, prompting community outcry and a fundraising effort. The ongoing enforcement actions have sparked protests, including from fans at a Los Angeles Galaxy soccer game who object to the raids.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has unilaterally halted a shipment of air defense missiles and other munitions to Ukraine, reportedly due to concerns about low U.S. stockpiles that Democrats say are baseless. This marks the third time Hegseth has paused aid, surprising Congress and allies. Ranking House Armed Services Committee Democrat Adam Smith stated that a review of the numbers shows no justification for the suspension. The delay of critical weapons like Patriot interceptor missiles comes as Russia intensifies its bombardment of Ukrainian cities, a decision a Ukrainian lawmaker called "painful."</p>

          <p>At 5-foot-4, Sonay Kartal is the shortest player in the women's singles main draw at Wimbledon, but she is using her other attributes to make her best-ever run at a Grand Slam. The 23-year-old British player, now in the fourth round, says she has worked to make up for her lack of height with exceptional speed and power. Kartal, who will make her Centre Court debut, has seen a rapid rise in the world rankings after overcoming injuries and a period of being self-funded. Her success is seen as a testament to her hard work and determination.</p>

          <p>Facing a seemingly impossible target of 536 runs on the final day of the second Test against India, England's "Bazball" era commitment to avoiding draws is being put to its ultimate test. The team's aggressive, win-or-lose mantra, established under coach Brendon McCullum, may need to be flexible to salvage the match and preserve their series lead. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick hinted for the first time that the team is not "stupid enough" to ignore the possibility of playing for a draw if winning becomes unattainable. The final day's play will reveal if England adapts its strategy.</p>

Activists from the network Grupa Granica provide essential aid like food, water, and medical care to people hiding in the forest, often for weeks.
