          <p>Pharmaceutical companies received temporary relief from reciprocal tariffs, but the reprieve is expected to be short-lived. The Trump administration is considering a 232 investigation into the pharmaceutical sector, which could result in import duties.  While healthcare stocks initially rose, they later declined as investors anticipated further uncertainty.  The industry is lobbying for a phased approach to allow time for manufacturing relocation.</p>
