          <p>Renowned author Sir Philip Pullman has called on the UK government to revise copyright laws concerning the 'scraping' of literary works by artificial intelligence (AI) software. He argues that writers are not compensated or recognized when their books are used to train AI, describing the practice as immoral theft that threatens creative fields. Pullman, known for his 'His Dark Materials' series, advocates for immediate legal changes to ensure fair compensation and protect creators' intellectual property in the evolving digital landscape. He believes the current system is 'wicked' and demands government intervention to fight back against unauthorized AI use.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets experienced a downturn on Wednesday as investors evaluated Japan's latest trade figures and the implications of its new leadership. Japanese exports in September saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase, breaking a four-month decline, primarily driven by strong growth in shipments to Asia. However, this rebound fell short of analyst expectations, and exports to the U.S. continued to drop. The Nikkei 225 led regional losses, with SoftBank shares plunging over 5%, as the market reacted to the economic data and the recent swearing-in of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her new cabinet.</p>

          <p>New Orleans is preparing for the arrival of National Guard troops by late November, as confirmed by Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick. The deployment, requested by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, aims to bolster security for major events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. Kirkpatrick emphasized that the troops will operate in partnership with local law enforcement as a 'force multiplier,' not to take over, despite the city's police department facing understaffing issues. While acknowledging the need for support during large events, the superintendent expressed that she does not believe Guard troops should be deployed for general law enforcement functions outside of these specific circumstances.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 22:25:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Precious metals gold and silver witnessed their most significant daily decline in years, abruptly ending a remarkable rally. Spot gold plunged over 6%, its largest intraday fall since 2013, while silver tumbled more than 8%. This market correction is attributed to easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and indicators suggesting overbought conditions. Despite the sharp drop, some analysts remain bullish on gold for the coming year, forecasting higher price targets due to persistent inflation, low real interest rates, and ongoing geopolitical concerns, suggesting this might be a temporary dip rather than a sustained reversal.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has asserted that the national inquiry into grooming gangs will maintain its original focus and scope, addressing concerns raised by abuse survivors. Her statement follows the resignation of three survivors from the inquiry panel, who feared the scope was being diluted to include broader child sexual abuse and exploitation, and expressed frustration over delays in appointing a chairperson. Mahmood confirmed the inquiry would explicitly examine the ethnicity and religion of offenders, acknowledging the survivors' frustrations and inviting them to return. Critics, including Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp, have called for a senior judge to chair the inquiry to ensure impartiality.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters gathered in New York City's Chinatown after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted raids targeting the sale of counterfeit goods, resulting in multiple detentions. Federal agents, including FBI and Border Patrol, were seen detaining individuals and using an armored military vehicle, prompting outrage from community leaders and politicians. Local officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, distanced the NYPD from the federal operation, reiterating New York City's policy against cooperating with civil deportations. Critics condemned the aggressive tactics, viewing the raids as an abuse of federal power and a politically motivated action by the Trump administration that instilled fear rather than safety.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is grappling with a significant rise in copper wire thefts, leaving many communities in darkness and costing millions in repairs. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, targeting recyclers who purchase stolen metal. The legislation will mandate stricter identity verification for sellers and make it illegal to possess certain scrap metals from public infrastructure, increasing penalties for non-compliant recyclers. City officials are also exploring solutions like solar lighting and updating property assessment rates to fund streetlight maintenance, as the current backlog for repairs extends up to a year due to the pervasive theft.</p>

          <p>Samsung and Google have launched their new Galaxy XR mixed reality headset, powered by the Android XR operating system co-developed with Qualcomm. Priced at $1,799, the device aims to compete with Apple's Vision Pro and Meta's Quest 3, offering passthrough vision, eye-tracking, and hand gesture navigation. A key differentiator is the integration of Google's Gemini AI assistant, enabling users to ask questions about their real-world surroundings or on-screen content. Samsung views the Galaxy XR as a foundational step toward future 'AI glasses,' which will eventually include wired, then wireless, smart glasses with built-in displays, demonstrating a long-term vision for augmented reality technology.</p>

          <p>Japanese exports in September ended a four-month streak of declines, increasing by 4.2% year-on-year, primarily due to robust growth in shipments to Asia, especially mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped significantly by 13.3%, largely impacted by a 24.2% fall in auto shipments. This rebound in overall exports, driven partly by semiconductor exports, still missed analyst expectations. Despite a trade deal with Washington that lowered tariffs, the U.S. market remains challenging, while Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's loose monetary policy stance is anticipated to weaken the yen, potentially making Japanese goods more competitive globally.</p>

He contends that Democrats are instead pushing for immediate negotiations on health insurance subsidies and Medicaid restrictions, which Republicans believe should only occur after the shutdown ends.

Despite the pullback, which also saw silver fall sharply, Gross believes gold will likely 'hold up better than stocks' in the coming weeks.

They also refute the idea of 'self-cleaning' hair, stressing that regular washing is crucial to prevent oil and debris buildup, which can worsen scalp conditions.

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial that he never witnessed signs of drug use from his late teammate Tyler Skaggs before Skaggs' fatal overdose in 2019. Trout, a three-time MVP, spoke about his close friendship with Skaggs and his unawareness of his teammate's drug habits. The trial centers on whether the Angels organization is liable for its former communications director, Eric Kay, allegedly providing Skaggs with fentanyl-laced pills. While Trout acknowledged seeing Kay act 'wired' and suspecting drug use from him, he stated he did not know Kay was reportedly supplying opioids to players, and the cause of Skaggs' death was a shock.</p>

          <p>An article analyzes the contrasting outcomes of President Trump's diplomatic efforts in Gaza versus Ukraine, highlighting his unique leverage in the Middle East. In Gaza, Trump's long-standing support for Israel and economic ties to Arab nations gave him significant influence to broker a ceasefire and hostage release. Conversely, in the Ukraine war, Trump's fluctuating approach—alternating between pressuring Putin and Zelensky—has yielded little progress. The article suggests Putin may be exploiting Trump's desire for a deal to influence U.S. policy. Despite initial promises to end the Ukraine war quickly, Trump has acknowledged the limits of his power, finding a peace framework elusive when neither side is willing to concede.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study has for the first time ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing substantial differences between medications. Researchers from King's College London and the University of Oxford analyzed 151 studies covering 30 drugs, focusing on the first eight weeks of treatment. The findings show significant variations in weight changes, heart rate, and blood pressure, with some drugs causing up to a 2kg weight gain or a 21-beat-per-minute heart rate difference. The article emphasizes that these differences are clinically important and call for a more personalized approach to prescribing, matching antidepressants to individual patient needs and health conditions to improve adherence and outcomes.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Drivers Behind Skyrocketing UK Supermarket Prices, Using Orange Juice as Case Study</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 19:43:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An in-depth article examines the multifaceted reasons behind the significant surge in UK supermarket prices, using the dramatic increase in orange juice costs as a prime example. Factors contributing to this inflation include crop diseases, extreme weather, over-reliance on single-nation supply, new packaging regulations, and global trade tensions. The price of a liter of orange juice has risen 134% since 2020, leading manufacturers to substitute oranges with cheaper fruits like mandarins. This analysis suggests that while some price shocks may be temporary, the UK's high dependence on food imports and climate-related challenges in supplier countries indicate that consumers may need to brace for persistently high and volatile food prices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is demanding $230 million in compensation from the Department of Justice for its criminal investigations into him, dating back to before and after his first term. The New York Times reported that Trump submitted administrative claims related to probes into his 2016 campaign's ties with Russia and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents. Trump confirmed the amount, stating he was 'damaged very greatly' and would donate any received funds to charity. The situation raises significant ethical questions, as any payment would need approval from high-ranking DOJ officials, including his former personal lawyer, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, whom Trump appointed.</p>

Grijalva believes Johnson's delay is aimed at preventing her from signing a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, which currently needs one more signature.

The outage, which cost companies hundreds of billions of dollars and disrupted critical services like payments and medical appointments, serves as a stark reminder that the 'cloud' is a physical, fallible infrastructure. Critics argue that this centralization, while offering accessibility and cost savings, concentrates potential points of failure and grants enormous influence to a handful of digital landowners, underscoring the need for more decentralized alternatives.</p>
