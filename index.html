          <p>Fintech company Chime has filed paperwork for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq, planning to list under the ticker symbol "CHYM." Chime emphasizes its status as a technology company rather than a bank, deriving revenue from interchange fees on debit and credit card purchases. The company reported 8.6 million active members as of March, with an average revenue per active member of $251. While IPOs initially showed signs of recovery, recent tariff announcements have led Chime and other companies to delay their plans, indicating ongoing market volatility.</p>

          <p>Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg's appearance at an Iowa town hall has fueled speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. Buttigieg, who previously ran in the 2020 Democratic primary and served as a key surrogate for Biden and Harris, addressed a progressive veterans' group, VoteVets Action Fund. While he did not explicitly confirm his intentions, he mentioned assessing the office and his capabilities before making a decision. The Iowa visit, combined with other public appearances, suggests Buttigieg is keeping his options open for a future White House run, especially given other Democrats are also making appearances in key voting states.</p>

          <p>Despite repeated promises not to cut Medicaid, President Trump is facing scrutiny as House Republicans propose significant reductions to the program in their agenda. Trump has maintained that his administration will focus on eliminating fraud and abuse within Medicaid while preserving benefits for those who legitimately qualify. However, critics argue that the proposed changes, such as work requirements and stricter eligibility checks, will result in millions of Americans losing healthcare coverage. Senate Republicans are also expressing concerns, creating internal divisions over the proposed cuts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget cuts are causing alarm among state leaders, who fear they will be unable to compensate for reduced federal funding for essential public services. The administration aims to decrease federal aid for programs ranging from infrastructure and education to healthcare and housing, arguing that states should bear more financial responsibility. Governors and officials, particularly Democrats, worry that these cuts could force them to make difficult decisions, such as reducing Medicaid coverage or delaying infrastructure projects. The situation highlights the potential ripple effects of federal fiscal policy on state economies and public services.</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals of extreme food shortage warnings, an internal Israeli analysis indicates a looming crisis in Gaza due to blocked aid deliveries. Israeli military officials have privately warned commanders that many areas of Gaza will run out of food within weeks unless the blockade is lifted. This assessment contrasts with the Israeli government's stance that the blockade poses no major threat to civilian life. Aid agencies report that bakeries and charity kitchens are closing, and the UN's World Food Program has exhausted its food stocks, highlighting the urgency of the humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market's recovery to pre-tariff levels, investors remain cautious due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies. While the administration has eased its trade offensive, investors lack clarity on the final level of tariffs, making it difficult to predict the economy's direction. This uncertainty is causing businesses to delay investment decisions and consumers to reduce spending, potentially slowing economic growth. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a wait-and-see approach, holding off on further interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of the tariffs become clearer.</p>

The administration must decide whether to defend Biden-era regulations enforcing mental health parity, which requires insurers to cover mental health care comparably to physical health care. A trade association representing large employers has sued the government, arguing the regulations overstep authority and increase costs. Clinicians and advocates urge the administration to fight back, emphasizing the need to make parity a practical reality, while opponents argue the regulations are misguided and won't address the provider shortage.</p>

          <h2>Doctors Discuss Implications of Prostate Nodule Discovery in Former President Biden</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the discovery of a prostate nodule in former President Biden, urologists are discussing the potential implications, noting that the significance depends on various factors. While nodules can be benign, resulting from inflammation or nonthreatening conditions like nodular benign prostatic hypertrophy, they can also indicate cancer. Doctors debate the necessity of routine prostate exams for men of Biden's age, given the slow-growing nature of prostate cancers and the potential for unnecessary intervention. Further evaluation, including PSA tests, MRIs, or biopsies, may be required to determine the nature of the nodule.</p>

          <h2>Gold Prices Remain High Despite Cooling Inflation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While recent reports indicate cooling inflation, gold prices have remained strong, breaking records and surpassing $3,400 per ounce. Typically, gold acts as an inflation hedge, decreasing in price when inflationary pressures ease; however, geopolitical tensions, central bank demand, and recession fears are also influencing the market. As a result, analysts suggest gold prices could reach between $3,500 and $3,800 by year-end, though short-term volatility is expected. Investors should consider these broader economic factors when evaluating gold's potential in their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria during a state visit to Saudi Arabia, a decision praised by the new Syrian leadership as a step toward reconstruction.

Trump's decision coincides with increased Saudi investment pledges in the U.S. and is expected to facilitate international aid and investment to help Syria recover from years of civil war.</p>

A CBS News investigation identified errors, including a $38 million contract for wastewater monitoring that was modified, not canceled.
