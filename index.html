          <p>The Supreme Court has intervened in President Trump's deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants facing expulsion. The court criticized the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation, highlighting that this did not meet due process requirements. Legal scholars have praised the courts for upholding constitutional principles, while expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place. The Supreme Court's decision underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding the administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement and the judiciary's role in safeguarding immigrants' rights.</p>

          <p>Severe weather, including tornadoes, has caused significant damage and fatalities across the US Midwest, particularly in Missouri and Kentucky.

St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer described the storms as one of the worst in the city's history, with over 5,000 buildings damaged. The storms have also impacted infrastructure, damaging cellphone towers and disrupting traffic, while highlighting staffing shortages at the National Weather Service, which is facing staffing shortages after the Trump administration ordered cuts.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new social studies curriculum, influenced by State School Superintendent Ryan Walters, will require high school students to identify 'discrepancies' in the 2020 election results. This revision includes examining graphs and information related to the election, such as the halting of ballot counting and security risks of mail-in balloting. The curriculum changes have faced criticism, including concerns from fellow Republicans, who worry about last-minute additions, and a lawsuit from parents and educators who claim the standards are biased. The changes are expected to cost taxpayers $33 million in new textbooks and related materials.</p>

          <p>President Trump has endorsed the idea that the Supreme Court's decision to temporarily block his administration's ability to deport Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act is 'illegal'. Trump reposted comments from ally Mike Davis, who criticized the court's decision and suggested housing the affected individuals near the homes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This comes after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration's deportation plans, citing concerns about due process. Trump's remarks reflect a pattern of criticizing federal judges who rule against him, raising concerns about the independence of the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Tornadoes tore through parts of the US Midwest, resulting in at least 25 deaths and dozens of injuries across Missouri and Kentucky. Authorities in Kentucky reported 18 deaths, while Missouri officials confirmed seven fatalities, including five in St Louis. The storms caused widespread damage, with 5,000 buildings affected in Missouri, and left approximately 140,000 properties without power. St Louis imposed a curfew in the most heavily damaged areas, and rescue efforts are underway to search for survivors.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is launching its Memorial Day outdoor sales event, a crucial period for home improvement retailers, offering significant discounts on plants, landscaping materials, grills, and patio furniture. In fiscal year 2024, garden sales contributed $20.83 billion, about 13% of Home Depot's total revenue. Analysts anticipate a challenging first quarter due to unfavorable weather and weak consumer sentiment, but stronger outdoor sales and a recovering housing market could boost performance. The retailer remains cautious due to tariff uncertainty, but CEO Ted Decker is confident in the company's ability to navigate the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

The Mosura's body included 16 segments lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods, showcasing its complexity. The fossil also revealed the Mosura's open circulatory system and its swimming style, similar to modern stingrays.</p>
