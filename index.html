          <p>President Trump's tariffs, initially 25% and then doubled to 50%, have severely impacted India's shrimp export industry, a major supplier to the U.S. This policy, aimed at punishing India for purchasing Russian oil, has led to job losses for over a million people, including processing plant workers and farmers. The industry faces drastic drops in sales and struggles to diversify markets, threatening the livelihoods of many small enterprises and raising concerns about the long-term economic damage.</p>

          <p>In Gaza, the start of September brings not classrooms but bombed buildings, displacement, and worsening famine, profoundly disrupting children's education. Teachers volunteer in makeshift "educational tents" with minimal supplies, struggling to distract students from hunger and trauma. Most schools are damaged or destroyed, and virtual learning initiatives are largely inaccessible due to lack of electricity and devices. The article highlights the immense challenges faced by children trying to learn amidst the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal for a $100,000 application fee for the H-1B foreign worker visa program has caused "extreme chaos" and widespread dismay among economists, tech companies, and universities. Critics argue the move could lead to a significant loss of talent, dramatically handicap key industries like AI, and force multinational companies to relocate operations. While the administration claims the program is exploited, experts believe the fee is an astronomical penalty unrelated to addressing existing abuses, potentially damaging long-term American innovation.

          <p>A discussion at the Berlin International Literature Festival, titled "The US Under Trump 2.0," explored the state of freedom of speech and what authors perceive as President Trump's underlying authoritarian and racist ideology. Renowned authors, including Jamaica Kincaid, Elizabeth Kolbert, and William Hitchcock, expressed concerns over increased censorship, media lawsuits, and the erosion of established norms. Historian William Hitchcock argued that racism is central to understanding Trump's support, despite differing views on issues like climate change and abortion.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend four key strategies for homebuyers and refinancers to find lower mortgage rates this October, despite current elevated levels. These include comparing multiple lenders, improving one's credit score, considering adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or shorter-term loans, and buying mortgage points if financially sensible. The advice aims to help borrowers navigate the current market, especially as the real estate season slows, potentially increasing lender competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article challenges President Donald Trump's assertion that Tylenol (paracetamol) is dangerous for children and linked to autism and ADHD, stating he is wrong on both counts. It highlights that scientists have reached no firm conclusions on such a link, and medical consensus does not support his claims. The piece underscores the importance of relying on scientific evidence rather than unsubstantiated presidential statements regarding public health.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Noni Madueke is expected to be out of action for approximately six to eight weeks due to a knee injury sustained in a recent match against Manchester City.
