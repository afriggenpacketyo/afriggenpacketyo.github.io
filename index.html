        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing increasing regulatory and trade pressures in the U.S., Temu and Shein are strategically pivoting to Europe and the UK as key growth markets, increasing advertising spending and expanding warehouse capacity. However, these platforms are encountering similar regulatory scrutiny in Europe, including a proposed customs fee and investigations into deceptive business practices. A French bill targeting ultra-cheap platforms like Shein and Temu seeks to penalize fast-fashion products for their environmental impact. Consumer spending data indicates a slowdown in U.S. growth for Temu and Shein, with some customers shifting to traditional retailers, while growth is observed in the UK and EU, particularly in France. The challenges in Europe include stricter regulations on product safety and consumer protection, requiring significant investments in compliance and operational transparency. Optimism is somewhat tempered by the regulatory hurdles facing the companies.</p>

          <p>Two people were killed in Odesa, Ukraine, following a night of intense Russian drone and missile strikes targeting cities including Kyiv and Dnipro. Ukraine's air force reported that Russia launched over 300 air attack vehicles, including drones and missiles, with a significant number being neutralized. Civilian infrastructure in Kyiv sustained major damage, and a maternity hospital in Odesa was among the buildings hit. President Zelenskyy called for concrete action from the U.S. and Europe to pressure Russia into peace, condemning the attacks and emphasizing the need for a strong global response. The attacks come after Russia claimed to have downed 103 Ukrainian drones and as prisoner swaps occurred after peace talks in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>China's policy of non-interference is being tested by its relationship with Niger's military government, which initially received substantial financial support from Beijing. However, relations have soured following disputes over salary disparities between expatriate and local workers in Chinese oil companies. Niger has ordered China National Petroleum Corporation to terminate contracts of expatriate employees with over four years of service, highlighting the challenges of Beijing's regime-agnostic approach. Experts suggest that China's non-interference policy, while intended to avoid entanglement, can incur economic costs as nationalism rises in some nations, as China tends to invest heavily in the economic priorities of ruling regimes.</p>

          <p>At least 17 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded by Israeli gunfire near an aid distribution site in central Gaza, according to local health officials. The incident occurred as thousands of displaced people approached the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site. The Israeli military stated they are investigating the incident and had previously warned Palestinians not to approach routes leading to GHF sites during certain hours, describing them as closed military zones. Witnesses reported chaos and violence around the distribution sites, with many Gazans walking long distances to seek aid amidst warnings of famine. The war erupted after Hamas-led militants took hostages and killed civilians in an attack in 2023, leading to an Israeli military campaign that has resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan is behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report acknowledges insufficient efforts to close gender gaps by 2030, referencing Japan's low ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. Despite setting a goal in 2003 to raise the share of women in leadership roles to about 30% by 2020, the target has been delayed, as the proportion remains low. The government plans to intensify efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women in decision-making, focusing on local economies and small businesses to combat female brain drain in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Official figures suggest that UK companies are holding back on hiring and not replacing departing workers, causing a significant drop in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. Experts suggest that businesses are looking to offset rising employment costs through reduced headcount and slower hiring activity, potentially leading to a further increase in the unemployment rate. Average wage growth has slowed to 5.2%, remaining above the inflation rate, which increased to 3.5% for the year to April.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to Southeast Asian industrial centers have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have seen double-digit percentage growth compared to the same period in 2024. This shift is attributed to Chinese manufacturers rerouting exports through Southeast Asia to circumvent U.S. tariffs, with factories in these countries adding local content to qualify for re-export.

          <h2>Tighter Border Controls Strengthen People Smugglers in Europe</h2>

          <p>Europe's tighter border controls and anti-smuggling policies are inadvertently strengthening people smuggling networks, making them more profitable as migrants become increasingly reliant on their services. Violence linked to organized immigration crime is escalating in Serbia and along the Western Balkans route, with smuggling groups fighting over territory and clients. Smugglers are charging exponential prices, up to â‚¬15,000 for transit from Turkey to Germany and France, exploiting the closure of migrant reception centers and stricter border enforcement. Migrants are forced to use smugglers for every step of their journey, making them more vulnerable to exploitation and violence, with concerns rising over the safety of those hidden in private accommodations.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 meeting in Canada. Before the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator will visit Washington for further negotiations on Trump's tariffs. Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but may consider accepting reduced rates as the U.S. has consistently refused to eliminate the duties. Both countries aim to reach a deal quickly, focusing on boosting investment and reducing the trade deficit.</p>

          <p>A recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA due to a serious health risk, as cans labeled "zero sugar" were found to contain the full amount of sugar. The affected cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, have the product code XXXXRS05165 with a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses risks to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as it can lead to hyperglycemia.

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting Europe's legal loopholes to traffic ketamine, swapping it for substances like salt during transit across multiple borders. This allows them to profit from the booming market for the hallucinogenic drug, which is classified as a legal medicine in some countries but a narcotic in others. Investigations have uncovered numerous consignment switches involving tonnes of ketamine, with criminal gangs making more money from ketamine than other illegal drugs. The preferred smuggling route involves shipping ketamine from India through Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, before reaching the UK, where consumption has risen sharply.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to address elevated prices of the country's staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the goal of selling the 2020 rice at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, with the released rice going to smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops. The government aims to quickly deliver the stockpiled rice to consumers at lower prices, addressing public frustration over rising rice prices.</p>

A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries found that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children.
