          <p>The New York State Legislature has passed a bill that would allow terminally ill individuals to end their lives with medical assistance, now awaiting Governor Kathy Hochul's signature. This legislation, often referred to as medical aid in dying, permits eligible patients to request and receive medication to hasten their death, providing them with greater autonomy over their end-of-life care. The bill includes safeguards to ensure that patients are making informed decisions and are mentally competent. If signed into law, New York would join a growing number of states that have legalized this practice. The passage of the bill marks a significant shift in the state's approach to end-of-life care.</p>

          <p>China's development of two next-generation stealth fighter jets, the Chengdu J-36 and the Shenyang J-50, has garnered international attention. The J-36, nicknamed "Gingko leaf" due to its distinctive diamond shape and delta wing platform, is designed to reduce air drag at high speeds and enhance radar evasion. Key features include tailless design, trailing edge control surfaces, and split flaps for improved maneuverability. While official details remain scarce, observations and images have provided insights into the aircraft's aerodynamic advancements and stealth capabilities. The J-50 is also being closely watched for its potential impact on regional military dynamics.</p>

          <p>Victims of the January 6th Capitol riot and congressional Democrats have accused the Trump administration of hypocrisy in its response to recent protests in Los Angeles compared to the Capitol attack. They point to the administration's swift condemnation of the L.A. protests and deployment of the National Guard, contrasting it with Trump's previous downplaying of the January 6th events and pardons for rioters. Critics argue that Trump's differing reactions reveal a double standard, where violence is only condemned when it opposes his political interests. This perceived hypocrisy has fueled further controversy and accusations of rewriting history.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that the FBI has identified a suspect accused of assaulting a federal officer during protests in Los Angeles. The suspect, identified as Reyes, is accused of injuring an officer by throwing rocks at law enforcement vehicles, prompting a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Federal authorities are pursuing charges under the Hobbs Act, with potential penalties including up to 20 years in prison for looting and up to five years for spitting on federal officers. The FBI's swift action underscores the administration's commitment to cracking down on violence against law enforcement during the protests.</p>

This move aims to support ICE and enable federal law enforcement officers to conduct their duties safely. However, California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized the deployment as "reckless" and a "power grab," arguing that the initial 2,000 troops remain unused and that the military presence is unnecessary and could escalate tensions.

          <h2>New Guidance Allows Teachers to Use AI for Marking</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence to save time on marking and administrative tasks, freeing them up for more face-to-face interaction with students. Teachers can use AI to automate routine tasks, such as marking quizzes and writing letters to parents, but must remain transparent about their use of AI and verify its results. The Department for Education emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking. While the Association of School and College Leaders supports the use of AI to free up time for teaching, they acknowledge there are still "big issues" to be resolved.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all members of the CDC's vaccine panel, a committee that makes significant decisions about immunizations, including those for children. Kennedy cited conflicts of interest as undermining trust in vaccinations, but his decision has drawn criticism from medical professionals who view it as disrupting a transparent process. The move raises concerns about the future composition of the committee and its potential impact on public health. It is currently unknown who will be appointed to replace the board members.</p>

The redistricting push underscores the intense political maneuvering ahead of the next election cycle. This may be seen as a risky strategy with uncertain outcomes.</p>

          <p>A former chair of the Environment Agency warns that successive governments have failed to address the threat of toxic chemicals in sewage sludge spread on farmers' fields. The sludge, used as cheap fertilizer, may contain cancer-linked chemicals, microplastics, and industrial pollutants. Efforts to update regulations to include new contaminants have been "continually frustrated." There is increasing concern that farmers may stop accepting the sludge, leading water firms to make contingency plans.
