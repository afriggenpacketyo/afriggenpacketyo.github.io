        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, previously wrongly deported, can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges, determining the government didn't prove he was a flight risk. The judge acknowledged Abrego Garcia will likely remain in custody, potentially transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to an immigration detainer. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants, while the defense claims the charges are a distraction from his due process issues. A hearing is scheduled to set release conditions, though ICE custody remains probable. </p>

Bradley's win, his eighth on the PGA Tour, has significant implications for the upcoming Ryder Cup, where he aims to be a playing captain.

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials disclosed details of Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history."

The strikes involved Tomahawk cruise missiles and GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, inflicting severe damage to sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan.

          <p>Chinese companies, known for their high-risk tolerance in overseas markets, are increasingly acknowledging escalating risks in conflict-ridden African nations. These risks include geopolitical instability, political unrest, abrupt policy changes, and security threats, which affect investments in mineral-rich countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and nations in the Sahel. Chinese firms face attacks on mining sites, kidnappings of workers, and piracy, leading to calls for greater protection of Chinese nationals abroad.

          <p>Kyoto saw a record 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, with overall visitors reaching the second-highest on record, despite growing concerns about overtourism. A survey indicated high satisfaction levels among both foreign and Japanese tourists, with over 90% expressing satisfaction with their sightseeing experience. Foreign visitors favored temples, shrines, and historic sites, while Japanese visitors were more bothered by the crowds. To combat overtourism, Kyoto plans to implement a lodging tax increase in 2026, with revenues allocated to strengthen measures addressing tourism-related issues.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, President Trump addressed the possibility of regime change in Iran, suggesting that if the current regime cannot "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN," a change might be necessary. He deemed the bombing of Iranian nuclear sites "a spectacular military success," claiming Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated." Trump's remarks, posted on Truth Social, signal a potential shift in U.S. policy toward Iran, hinting at a more aggressive stance.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is receiving renewed attention as Japan approaches a period with no giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Tokyo, potentially announcing a new loan during a high-level visit. Historically, pandas have symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits, but experts question if the gesture will carry the same diplomatic weight. Japan currently houses six pandas, but their loan periods are expiring, prompting speculation about future panda diplomacy efforts.</p>

Instead, they employ language that fosters cooperation by honoring a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries.

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported for suspected cyberstalking offenses, prompting calls for education on healthy digital relationships. Charities suggest that the normalization of constant online monitoring from a young age is fueling concerning behaviors. Cyberstalking, defined as using digital tools to harass or threaten, is affecting younger children, with the sharing of locations and checking online activity often seen as signs of love and care. Experts stress the importance of teaching meaningful consent and responsible location sharing.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, are now available at GP surgeries in England for individuals meeting strict criteria, including a high BMI and specific health conditions. This staggered approach aims to prioritize those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. Mounjaro, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, helps with weight loss by making individuals feel fuller, leading to reduced eating. Patients will also receive support with exercise and diet, but availability may vary by location, and some GP practices are cautioning patients who do not meet the criteria against booking appointments.</p>

Trump warned Iran against retaliating, stating that any retaliation would be met with greater force.

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz.

Experts warn that any interference with oil flows through the strait could upset international energy markets and economies.

While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors, and some patients report positive experiences with the therapy.

          <h2>Satellite Images Suggest Severe Damage to Fordow Nuclear Plant</h2>

          <p>Commercial satellite imagery indicates that the U.S. attack on Iranâ€™s Fordow nuclear plant severely damaged the site, potentially destroying the uranium-enriching centrifuges. Experts caution that the below-ground destruction is unconfirmed, and Iran likely moved a stockpile of highly enriched uranium before the strike. The imagery shows six holes where bunker-busting bombs penetrated the mountain, but the hall containing the centrifuges is too deeply buried to evaluate damage. Some experts fear Iran may accelerate its nuclear program underground and out of sight.</p>
