          <p>Rice prices in Japan more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge contributes to Japan's core inflation rate, which reached its highest level since January 2023, driven primarily by rising food costs. The government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate rice prices, and analysts suggest that future inflation trends will heavily depend on food prices, especially rice. The Bank of Japan held rates steady but indicated potential future rate hikes contingent on underlying inflation approaching the 2% target, while also forecasting a sluggish economy.

          <p>China maintained its benchmark lending rates unchanged after cutting them last month, as a trade agreement with the U.S. has eased some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China kept the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. Trade-war fears have diminished after U.S. and Chinese representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, which allows for rare earth and tech trade and suspends prohibitive tariffs. Chinese authorities may exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus, focusing on alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and its Central Asian partners convened at a high-level summit to address shared security concerns amidst global turbulence. The strengthening ties between Beijing and the five Central Asian countries have prompted inquiries about Russia's regional dominance, especially as it remains focused on the Ukraine war. While the Kremlin dismisses concerns, diplomatic observers suggest Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China's expanding influence. Beijing is avoiding directly challenging Russia as Central Asia's key security guarantor and dominant power, maintaining a delicate balance in the region.</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices rose by 3.7% in May, marking the largest increase in over two years, primarily due to surging rice and food costs, according to government data. The increase in the nationwide consumer price index, excluding fresh food, was the sharpest since January 2023, with the inflation rate remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Food prices, excluding fresh items, increased significantly, with rice prices setting a record for the eighth consecutive month. Economists anticipate rice prices to decline with the new harvest in the fall, potentially easing the impact on consumer prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump used social media on Juneteenth to criticize the number of "non-working holidays" in the United States, arguing they cost the country billions of dollars. This statement contrasts with his previous claims of making Juneteenth "very famous" and recognizing it as a historic day. Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S., became a federal holiday in 2021 under President Biden's administration. Trump's recent focus has been on eliminating DEI programs, marking a shift from his earlier acknowledgments of the holiday's significance.</p>

The province's finance department stated that disbursements will prioritize completing ongoing construction, clearing obligations, and reducing fiscal risk. Experts caution that the 20 billion yuan may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt and that the repayment picture is complicated by entangled triangular debts.</p>

          <h2>Leeds Maternity Services Downgraded to 'Inadequate' Following Concerns from Parents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 19:46:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maternity services at two Leeds hospitals have been downgraded from "good" to "inadequate" by the healthcare regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), due to failings that posed a significant risk to women and babies. Concerns from staff and patients about the quality of care and staffing levels were substantiated during unannounced inspections. The CQC issued a warning notice requiring immediate action to improve the services, with areas of concern including risk management, safe environment, and learning following incidents. Families who experienced inadequate care believe their children would have survived with better treatment, prompting calls for an independent review of the trust's maternity services.</p>

The Daily Express leads with a supporter's plea for MPs to allow the choice of a "good death," while the Daily Telegraph reports on the bill's knife-edge status. The Guardian focuses on President Trump's two-week deadline regarding U.S. involvement in the Middle East conflict, and the Financial Times highlights the EU's push for a UK-style trade deal with the U.S. amid Trump's July deadline.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated they denied U.S. immigration enforcement agents access to the parking lot at Dodger Stadium, though ICE refuted the claim, leading to confusion and heightened anxiety in the community. The homeland security presence came amid increased immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles, raising concerns among immigrant communities. The Dodgers have faced criticism for not speaking up for the immigrant community amid the raids, prompting a Spanish rendition of the national anthem at a recent game as a form of protest. The team plans to announce measures to support immigrant communities affected by the recent enforcement actions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An attack on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs, may not be effective due to the facility's depth and reinforced construction. Joe Cirincione, a national security expert, suggests that while an attack could cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it entirely. The U.S. weapon, the GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, is capable of penetrating 200 feet underground, but Fordo is said to be built deeper and reinforced with concrete. Continued military strikes may not be a good option, emphasizing the need for diplomatic solutions to ensure Iran rolls back its nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Belarusian dissidents living in exile are facing threats and harassment, with their relatives back home also being targeted by authorities. Since the crackdown on opposition protests in 2020, many Belarusians have fled the country, but continue to face persecution abroad. Tactics include sealing apartment doors, unsolicited messages with veiled threats, and visits to relatives by authorities. These actions are seen as a deliberate strategy by Lukashenko's government to sever ties between those who fled and those who remain in Belarus, creating an atmosphere of fear and isolation.</p>
