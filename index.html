          <p>Aleese Lightyear, a 35-year-old American, relocated to Chengdu, China, after feeling burnt out and financially strained by her high-pressure, 80-hour work weeks in New York City. Despite earning $100,000 annually in the U.S., she lived paycheck to paycheck with no savings. Now, as a university teacher in China, she earns about $30,000 a year but enjoys a significantly higher quality of life, working only 18 hours a week with benefits like free health insurance and paid vacations. This change has allowed her to save money for the first time, pursue hobbies, and experience a sense of freedom she describes as "living large."</p>

          <p>Shares of online travel company Tripadvisor surged by 17% following the disclosure that activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake of over 9%. The position, valued at approximately $160 million, has fueled speculation about potential strategic changes within the company. Starboard Value is known for pushing for significant shifts in the companies it invests in, including leadership changes and cost-cutting measures. Tripadvisor's stock had been struggling, having fallen over 30% in 2024, and the company had previously formed a committee to explore its options, making this new development particularly noteworthy for investors.

          <p>An investigation into the sale of illegal cigarettes across the UK reveals a problem deeply connected to serious organized crime, including human trafficking and illegal immigration. In cities like Hull, mini marts openly sell counterfeit and smuggled tobacco for a fraction of the legal price, with authorities struggling to combat the issue due to underfunding and low penalties. These illicit operations, sometimes run by international crime gangs, are seen by experts as a symptom of broader national issues, contributing to the decline of high streets and eroding public trust in government and law enforcement. The trade highlights a complex web of criminality that authorities are currently losing the battle against.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and 14 others injured. The incident occurred late Wednesday night as patrons were leaving an album release party for local rapper Mello Buckzz. Police state that occupants of a dark vehicle fired into the crowd in what appears to be a targeted attack, with some victims reportedly being part of the rapper's inner circle. The ages of the victims range from 21 to 32, and four of the injured remain in serious to critical condition. Authorities are investigating the possibility of gang involvement and potential retaliation, but no arrests have been made.</p>

          <p>Mexican boxer and former world champion Julio César Chávez Jr. has been arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in California and is being processed for expedited removal. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Chávez has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged involvement in organized crime and is believed to be an affiliate of the Sinaloa cartel. Authorities also noted that he made fraudulent statements on a lawful permanent resident application, which was based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen who also allegedly has cartel connections.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records who are currently being held at a naval base in Djibouti. This ruling clarifies a previous order, effectively lifting a lower court's injunction that had blocked the administration from deporting them to third countries, such as South Sudan, without due process. The administration has faced criticism for the plan, particularly concerning the dangerous conditions in South Sudan, though it claims to have received diplomatic assurances of the migrants' safety. The decision represents a significant development in the administration's broader policy of mass deportations and partnerships with other nations to accept deportees.</p>

The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was primarily driven by the government sector, which added 73,000 positions, while the healthcare industry also saw significant gains. Despite the positive report, economists anticipate a slowdown in the second half of the year, partly due to the potential impact of tariffs on economic activity and inflation, which may influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates.

          <p>President Trump's newly passed spending bill introduces several significant tax breaks, but four key provisions are designed to be temporary, expiring at the end of 2028. These include new federal income tax deductions for tips earned by service workers and for overtime pay, both of which are capped and phase out for higher earners. The bill also allows for a temporary deduction on interest paid for new auto loans and establishes "Trump accounts," a government-seeded savings vehicle for children born between 2025 and 2028. The temporary nature of these tax changes creates future uncertainty, similar to the 2017 tax cuts they are built upon. (not investment advice)</p>

Furthermore, toxicologists found a mixture of wildlife tranquilizing chemicals in her bone marrow, a compound Barry Morphew had access to and admitted to using on deer. This evidence supports the theory that he drugged his wife before her death, which was not immediate. Barry Morphew was re-arrested in June and charged with first-degree murder.</p>

The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, is estimated by the CBO to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over ten years.

          <p>A manhunt is underway for the gunman responsible for the shooting death of a 21-year-old congressional intern in Washington D.C. The victim, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, was killed by a stray bullet during an altercation between two groups that he was not involved in. The shooting, which police describe as targeted but not at Tarpinian-Jachym, also injured a woman and a 16-year-old boy. Federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, are assisting local police by enhancing video footage and conducting ballistics analysis. Tarpinian-Jachym was an intern for Rep. Ron Estes and a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.</p>

          <p>Rescue workers in Gaza report that at least 69 people were killed in intensified Israeli strikes on Thursday. One airstrike on a school in Gaza City, which was being used as a shelter for displaced families, killed 15 people, most of them women and children. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a "key" Hamas operative located there. In separate incidents, dozens more were reportedly killed while queuing for or traveling to receive aid, though the Israeli military has dismissed these reports as "lies." The renewed violence comes as international pressure continues for both Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal proposed by the US.</p>

          <p>Nissan has issued a recall for over 480,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada because of a manufacturing defect that could lead to engine failure while driving. The recall affects certain Altima, Rogue, Infiniti QX50, and Infiniti QX55 models equipped with specific 1.5L or 2.0L turbo engines. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, bearing failures in these engines can cause a loss of power, potentially preceded by abnormal engine noise or warning lights. Dealers will inspect the engines for metal debris and will repair or replace them free of charge. Owner notification letters are scheduled to be mailed in late August.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a nearly hour-long phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. The call occurred shortly after the White House confirmed a pause on some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision attributed to concerns over dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. According to the Kremlin, the two leaders discussed the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, and the recent passage of Trump's major legislative bill in Congress. This conversation highlights ongoing diplomatic communications between the two leaders amid the protracted conflict in Ukraine, with Trump also scheduled to speak with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>A new independent study estimates that over 80,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between October 2023 and January 2025, a figure substantially higher than official reports from the Gazan Ministry of Health. The research, led by academics and conducted with field researchers in Gaza, is the first to be based on household surveys rather than ministry records. The findings suggest that official counts, while not exaggerated, are a conservative minimum and that the actual death toll is much greater. The study also separates violent deaths from "indirect" deaths due to starvation and disease, providing a more comprehensive, though grim, picture of the conflict's total human cost.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology for broadcasting a performance by the group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival, during which the band led the crowd in a chant of "Death to the IDF." The broadcaster's director-general expressed deep regret for the "offensive and deplorable behavior," particularly to the Jewish community. In response to the incident, which has sparked a police investigation and resulted in the band's U.S. visas being revoked, the BBC has announced new policies for future festival coverage. These changes include keeping "high risk" acts off of live broadcasts to prevent similar controversies.</p>

          <p>Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan have become severely strained following a deadly police raid on ethnic Azeris in Yekaterinburg, Russia, and subsequent retaliatory arrests of Russian citizens in Baku. The initial incident, which left two Azeri men dead, was condemned by Azerbaijan as "unacceptable violence," leading to the cancellation of Russian cultural events. This diplomatic row is exacerbating existing tensions that have been simmering since the downing of an Azerbaijani passenger plane by a Russian missile in late 2024. Analysts suggest the conflict reflects Azerbaijan's increasingly assertive foreign policy and Moscow's diminishing influence in the Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece authored by former diplomats argues that Secretary of State Marco Rubio's plan to reorganize the State Department will effectively destroy its human rights and global justice initiatives. The plan would reportedly shutter most offices within the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) and lay off the majority of its expert staff. The authors contend this move undermines decades of bipartisan foreign policy, sends a message that the U.S. no longer prioritizes human rights, and will leave the world a more dangerous place. They call on Congress to use its power to block the reorganization and protect critical programs that promote stability and American interests.</p>

Furthermore, its deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid, which could cause millions to lose health coverage, provide a powerful line of attack for Democrats. The successful passage demonstrates Trump's ability to govern through Congress, but the debate over the bill's long-term consequences is only just beginning.</p>

          <p>The newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill" Act dramatically reshapes U.S. energy policy, delivering a major victory to the fossil fuel industry while ending critical federal support for solar and wind power. The law mandates new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands and waters, slashes royalty payments for producers, and ends long-standing investment and production tax credits for renewable energy projects starting after 2027. This move aligns with President Trump's stated preference for oil, gas, and coal over renewable sources.
