          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is actively working to reframe the January 6 Capitol attack as a moment of triumph rather than an insurrection. It cites the Air Force granting military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, a settlement with her family, and pardons for rioters as evidence of this historical revisionism. The author compares this effort to the "New Lost Cause" narrative that romanticized the Confederacy, suggesting that the perpetrators of the attack are being portrayed as victims while accountability is dismissed.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that advanced whole genome sequencing can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, setting a new legal precedent for the state. This cutting-edge DNA testing method, which can analyze degraded and rootless hair samples, linked Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on several victims. While prosecutors hailed the decision as a major victory, the defense challenged the ruling, arguing the lab used is not licensed in New York and that the science is inconclusive.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that there are "no immediate plans" to send the National Guard to Chicago, following President Trump's recent suggestions that federal forces would be deployed to the city. While Vance deferred to the president, he emphasized a desire to work with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has called the president's comments "unhinged" and threatened legal action. The article notes that the Trump administration has previously deployed the Guard to Washington D.C. and Los Angeles and is also planning expanded immigration enforcement in Chicago.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces are escalating attacks on the outskirts of Gaza City, with residents and hospitals reporting dozens of Palestinian casualties, including women and children. The Israeli military's chief of staff has vowed to continue operations against Hamas until the group is defeated and all hostages are freed. Meanwhile, the United Nations and aid agencies are warning of "horrific humanitarian consequences" for the million displaced people sheltering in the city, where famine was declared last month. Protesters in Israel are simultaneously demanding the government secure an immediate hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have approved the formation of a new subcommittee dedicated to reinvestigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The move, which passed along party lines, is framed by Republicans as an effort to "uncover the full truth" that they claim the previous Democratic-led committee overlooked. Chaired by Representative Barry Loudermilk with full subpoena power, the subcommittee is viewed by Democrats as an attempt to rewrite the narrative of the event and exonerate former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the riot.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze $2.2 billion in federal research grants for Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs determined the funding halt was unconstitutional retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with administration demands regarding its diversity programs and other policies. The ruling vacates the freeze orders, which had impacted numerous critical research projects unrelated to the administration's stated concerns about antisemitism on campus. The judge suggested the focus on antisemitism was a pretext for an "ideologically-motivated assault" on universities.</p>

The parade also featured the JL-3, a third-generation submarine-launched ballistic missile with a reported range of over 10,000 km, capable of reaching the United States mainland.

          <p>This article analyzes China's recent military parade as a clear message to the world, and specifically to President Trump, about its rising global power. It contrasts the display of advanced weaponry with Trump's "America First" trade policies, which have inadvertently pushed nations like China, Russia, and India into closer economic alignment. The author suggests that Trump's focus on tariffs creates "all risk and no reward," potentially undermining the U.S.-led international order while facing legal challenges at home. The parade is presented as a symbol of a shifting geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has denied reports that he was offered a position in the Trump administration in exchange for dropping out of his independent re-election campaign. Media outlets reported that Trump's team discussed offering Adams a job at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to consolidate the anti-progressive vote behind former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The alleged goal was to prevent Democratic socialist frontrunner Zohran Mamdani from winning the election. An Adams spokesperson stated the mayor is fully committed to his campaign and has had no such discussions.</p>

The 56-year-old is speaking publicly about his experience to encourage other men, particularly Black men, to be proactive about their health and to show that it is okay to be vulnerable while navigating a diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, has admitted she underpaid stamp duty tax on the sale of a flat, blaming incorrect legal advice. The issue revolves around the sale of her property in Hove while she also had an interest in a family home in Greater Manchester, which should have triggered a higher tax rate. Despite calls from the Conservative opposition for her to be sacked, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has backed his deputy. Rayner has referred herself to the Prime Minister's standards adviser and is contacting tax authorities to settle the amount owed.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The Restore Trust in Congress Act consolidates several previous proposals and has support from across the political spectrum, including both conservative and progressive lawmakers. The bill would require lawmakers to sell their individual stocks shortly after taking office and would impose financial penalties for violations. Supporters argue the ban is necessary to eliminate potential conflicts of interest and restore public trust. (not investment advice)</p>

Two-thirds of respondents reported that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so. Overall, a majority believe the economy is getting worse, reflecting ongoing pessimism about the nation's financial state. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the tenth anniversary of the 2015 European migrant crisis, contrasting the initial welcoming sentiment, epitomized by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's "we can do it" declaration, with today's much stricter policies. Concerns over security, economic strain, and social integration have fueled the rise of far-right parties and prompted even centrist governments to implement restrictive measures like border fences and outsourcing asylum processing. The article explores how countries from Greece to Sweden have shifted their approach, highlighting the complex and enduring political challenges posed by migration across the continent.</p>

          <p>More than 1,000 current and former employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have signed an open letter calling for Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign or be fired by President Trump. The letter accuses Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, of "endangering the nation's health" through his leadership. It cites recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director, changes to the vaccine approval system, and the elevation of "political ideologues" to key scientific posts. The HHS communications director defended Kennedy's record, stating he is working to restore trust.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups have negotiated an agreement with the Department of Justice to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being purged from the rolls. The DOJ, under President Trump, had sued the state to block voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial social security number. The new agreement allows these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue without disenfranchising them. A federal judge must still approve the settlement.</p>
