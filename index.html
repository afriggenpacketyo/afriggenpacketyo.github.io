          <p>Progressive groups across the U.S. are planning over 1,500 "No Kings Day" events to protest the Trump administration and counter the military parade in Washington, D.C., which marks the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday. Indivisible, a major organizing group, stated that the parade is a "made-for-TV display of dominance" for Trump's birthday, which also falls on June 14. The group has also criticized the White House for overreach against courts and actions that have hurt civil rights. The protests aim to convey that the country doesn't belong to a king and to oppose the use of taxpayer dollars for the parade, emphasizing the importance of democracy and the power of the people.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers that he and President Trump possess the authority to deploy National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere in the country to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

Hegseth's testimony followed the deployment of approximately 4,800 National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests.

Some auto executives are drawing parallels to China's struggling property sector and the Evergrande crisis.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

They fear that this action will undermine science, disrupt the regulatory process for vaccines, and erode public trust in vaccinations and federal health agencies. Some experts suggest Kennedy might appoint members sympathetic to anti-vaccine views, potentially leading to politicized recommendations. This could further decrease immunization rates and make the nation more vulnerable to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, impacting public health significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife experts caution that dirty hummingbird feeders can harm or kill the birds they are intended to help. Sugar water left out too long can spoil, attracting harmful microbes that cause infections, such as candida, which can swell a hummingbird's tongue and lead to starvation. Regular cleaning of feeders is crucial, requiring a change of nectar every one to three days, and thorough scrubbing with vinegar and water if mold is present. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also recommended as a healthy alternative to feeders.</p>

          <p>The bond market is bracing for a critical week as key inflation readings and Treasury auctions converge. Economists anticipate modest increases in consumer and producer prices for May, but any upside surprises could unsettle investors concerned about inflationary pressures. The Treasury Department will sell $39 billion of 10-year notes and $22 billion of 30-year bonds, providing insights into investor demand for Treasurys amid rising debt and deficits. The results could significantly influence the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rate policy. (not investment advice)</p>
