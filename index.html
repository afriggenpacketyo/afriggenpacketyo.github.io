          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding the deployment of live facial recognition (LFR) vans across seven police forces in England. These vans, equipped with advanced cameras, will assist in locating suspects for serious crimes, including sexual offenses, violent assaults, and homicides. While the government highlights the technology's success in making numerous arrests in London, privacy groups like Big Brother Watch express alarm, calling it a significant expansion of the surveillance state. A consultation on safeguards is underway, but critics argue the technology is being rolled out without adequate legal frameworks.</p>

          <p>Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic believes the company's small modular reactors (SMRs), designed to power energy-intensive AI data centers, could elevate it to the UK's most valuable firm. The engineering giant has secured deals with the UK and Czech governments for SMR development, tapping into a projected trillion-dollar market. While the technology is currently unproven, Rolls-Royce's existing nuclear expertise and plans for next-generation aircraft engines position it for significant growth. Erginbilgic credits the company's recent ten-fold share price increase to a strategic turnaround and strong market conditions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a review of content across several Smithsonian museums and exhibits, aiming to ensure they "reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story" for the upcoming America 250 celebration in 2026. This directive, stemming from President Trump's "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History" executive order, seeks to remove "divisive or partisan narratives." The review process involves analyzing current and future content, interviewing curators, and scrutinizing various materials.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders are engaging in talks with US President Donald Trump to emphasize that no decisions regarding Ukraine's borders should be made without Kyiv's input. This concerted effort comes ahead of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, amidst concerns that Trump might agree to "swapping of territories." Zelensky has firmly rejected any proposals to cede Ukrainian land, citing the country's constitution. The discussions aim to prevent Russia from redrawing Ukraine's borders by force and counter Moscow's narrative of advancement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over one in seven UK councils have reduced swimming pool temperatures in the past five years, primarily attributing the change to soaring energy costs. This trend, revealed by Freedom of Information requests, highlights the fragile financial state of local governments, with nearly a quarter of English councils cutting or closing leisure services. Critics, including individuals with muscular dystrophy who rely on warmer pools for exercise, fear the colder temperatures will deter swimmers and negatively impact public health. Councils face tough decisions to balance budgets while maintaining essential community services.</p>

          <p>New guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) encourages UK police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations.

The guidance follows a series of high-profile incidents, including the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old in Warwickshire. While decisions remain with individual forces, the Home Office supports this move for greater transparency and consistency.</p>

          <p>Major developers in Dubai are increasingly establishing in-house contracting firms, a shift from their traditional reliance on third-party contractors. This strategic move aims to gain greater control over construction timelines, costs, and quality standards, ultimately maximizing profits in a surging real estate market. With Dubai's property prices up 70% in four years and a plan to double the population, developers face challenges attracting external bids. While internalizing construction offers certainty, experts caution about potential risks, such as splitting focus and idle capacity during market downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

The concern among Ukraine's European allies is that Trump might propose a ceasefire on terms Zelenskyy cannot accept, allowing Putin to blame Ukrainian "intransigence" for prolonging the war.

          <p>A recent study published in Nature Communications reveals that foreign multinational enterprises (MNEs) generated 25% of all corporate emissions in China over the past two decades. The research, conducted by a collaboration of Chinese and international universities, highlights that eastern coastal regions benefited economically while central and western inland areas bore heavier environmental burdens. This finding raises new questions regarding the carbon emission responsibilities of foreign-owned enterprises. The study emphasizes that MNEs represent a significant, yet often overlooked, factor in shaping global carbon inequality.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's imposition of 39% tariffs on Swiss exports has deeply shaken Switzerland's long-standing economic isolation and sense of tranquility. As the US is Switzerland's largest export destination, the tariffs threaten to "annihilate" sales and have prompted the Swiss business minister to announce a furlough program. This move has triggered an identity crisis in a nation accustomed to neutrality and prosperity without shouldering global burdens. The tariffs are a "psychological shock," forcing Switzerland to reconsider its "have your cake and eat it" policy and potentially its relationship with the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

The extraditions come after the Justice Department agreed not to seek the death penalty against the defendants.

This legal victory, stemming from a lawsuit filed by UC professors, is seen as critical for UCLA's research efforts.
