          <p>China's defense ministry announced it had warned and "drove away" the USS Higgins, a U.S. destroyer it accused of illegally entering its territorial waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal. The U.S. Seventh Fleet refuted this claim, stating the vessel was conducting a routine "freedom of navigation operation" in accordance with international law and called China's statement false. This incident heightens military tensions in the contested South China Sea, a critical global shipping route where friction between China and the Philippines has also recently intensified. The confrontation adds another layer of complexity to the already strained U.S.-China relationship.</p>

          <p>Intense Israeli airstrikes have struck residential areas in Gaza City, causing significant destruction as Israeli forces prepare for a ground operation. The UK, EU, and other allies issued a joint statement urging Israel to take immediate steps to allow more humanitarian aid into the territory, warning that a famine is unfolding. The World Health Organization has also appealed for access to pre-stock hospitals with essential medical supplies ahead of the expected offensive. Despite Israel's plan to increase aid, local residents describe the ongoing bombardment as relentless, exacerbating the catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis reflects on London's changing economic landscape, noting a significant rise in the cost of living and persistent challenges from Brexit that hamper trade and productivity. The article questions London's ability to compete as a top global financial hub, citing a steep decline in initial public offerings and high business uncertainty, as noted by the Bank of England's governor. While a recent interest rate cut and new trade deals offer some hope, the piece suggests substantial policy changes are needed to boost growth, increase access to capital for startups, and restore the city's attractiveness for business and talent.

          <p>A review of UK newspaper headlines reveals major focus on the more than 50,000 migrants who have arrived on small boats since the new Labour government took power. Several papers report on the record pace of arrivals, while others highlight concerns from charities about potential homelessness as the government clears its asylum application backlog. Another prominent story involves the Treasury reportedly considering tightening inheritance tax rules on financial gifts to raise funds. This potential tax change has drawn criticism from the opposition, who argue it would unfairly penalize those wanting to pass on their assets to loved ones.</p>

This loss marks the Dodgers' third in a row and continues a difficult stretch where they have lost 20 of their last 32 games. The team is now tied for first place with the San Diego Padres, whom they are set to face this weekend.</p>

          <p>In a federal court case, the state of California is challenging the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles during protests against immigration policies. State lawyers argued the presence of a "standing army" was an unprecedented violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, and caused widespread anxiety. The Justice Department countered that the deployment was legal and necessary to protect federal property and personnel, denying any violation of the act. The trial is examining the president's authority to deploy troops for domestic purposes and the definition of a "rebellion."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the greatest danger from the upcoming Trump-Putin summit is not a military concession but President Trump adopting Vladimir Putin's distorted narrative about the war in Ukraine. The author suggests Putin will frame the conflict as a result of Ukrainian corruption and Western interference, a version that appeals to Trump's desire for a quick deal and his historical illiteracy. If Trump emerges from the meeting echoing Kremlin talking points, it could lead him to propose a ceasefire on terms unacceptable to Kyiv, thereby isolating Ukraine and blaming it for prolonging the war. This manipulation is presented as a greater threat than any battlefield development.</p>

The investigation is one of three special probes targeting Yoon's presidency, which ended after his impeachment and removal from office for imposing martial law.

These statistics follow the implementation of new police initiatives, including a roving task force and a drone program, which were launched after a local business owner was killed. While some short-term improvements are visible, particularly in Downtown, overall crime rates in the city's urban core remain elevated.</p>

According to the study, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this trend resulted in eastern coastal regions gaining more economic benefits while central and western inland areas bore heavier environmental burdens.

The move threatens to devastate sales to the U.S., Switzerland's most important market, and has triggered a major identity crisis. The article argues that the country's long-standing policy of isolationism and benefiting from the free world without sharing its burdens is no longer viable in an era of aggressive geoeconomics. The tariff shock has left the Swiss establishment scrambling for a response and questioning its traditional stance, especially as the EU appears to be getting a better trade deal.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) has successfully launched its first operational Vulcan rocket, marking a significant milestone for the company and the U.S. Space Force. The powerful new launcher, designed to replace ULA's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, lifted off from Cape Canaveral carrying two military satellites into a high geosynchronous orbit. One of the payloads is an experimental satellite, NTS-3, intended to test advanced navigation technology that could enhance future GPS systems. This flight was the first to be certified by the Space Force for carrying high-value national security payloads, positioning the Vulcan as a key vehicle for future military missions.</p>

          <p>A man arrested in connection with a fatal hit-and-run in Hollywood that killed 37-year-old Erika “Tilly” Edwards is currently free after posting $50,000 bail. The suspect, Davontay Robins, was arrested nearly a month after the June incident, in which Edwards was struck by a Mercedes G Wagon while walking to her car. Robins is charged with felony vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run resulting in death. The victim's husband expressed shock and dismay at the low bail amount, stating it cost more to bury his wife than for the suspect to be released from custody.</p>

          <p>Four days after a gunman attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's main campus in Atlanta, employees are expressing frustration with a lack of clear communication and leadership. An agency-wide all-hands meeting was described as short and insufficient, fueling a sense of disconnect between leadership and staff grappling with the trauma. The attack, which investigators believe was targeted and related to COVID-19, has highlighted internal issues, including recent dismissals of the agency's firearm violence prevention team.

          <p>China has introduced a year-long initiative to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support domestic demand. Under the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on loans for various purchases, including cars and education. The central government will fund 90% of the subsidy, with provincial governments covering the rest. Officials stated the policy aims to lower the cost of credit for households, unlock their spending potential, and help establish domestic consumption as the primary driver of the national economy.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared that his state will proceed with redrawing its congressional maps after a deadline he imposed on President Trump regarding a Texas redistricting plan passed. This move is a direct counter to Republican-led efforts in Texas to create a new map favorable to their party. Newsom had threatened this retaliatory action, warning of a national redistricting "arms race" but stating California could not stand by during a Republican "power grab." The governor plans to ask voters to approve a new map that could create five more Democratic-leaning seats, neutralizing potential GOP gains elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is currently moving westward, with early models projecting it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. Erin is the fifth named storm of the season, which is predicted by NOAA to be more active than normal.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal, which aims to move Chrome to an independent operator. Google has not announced any plans to sell the world's most popular browser and has previously called the idea of a spinoff a "radical interventionist agenda."</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study warns that progress has been highly uneven, with survival rates for some of the deadliest cancers showing little improvement. For cancers like melanoma, 10-year survival is now over 90%, but for those affecting the pancreas, lung, and esophagus, it remains below 20%. Researchers attribute the gap to a lack of early detection methods and effective treatments for these harder-to-treat cancers. Experts are calling for the government's upcoming cancer strategy to focus on cutting wait times and investing in research specifically targeting these less survivable cancers.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a significant 19-point lead in the New York City mayoral race. Mamdani is polling at 44% among registered voters, ahead of former Governor Andrew Cuomo at 25% and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams at 7%, both of whom are running as independents. The poll highlights a generational divide, with Mamdani dominating among younger voters while Cuomo leads with those over 55. In a separate hypothetical 2026 governor's race, incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul's lead over Republican Elise Stefanik has narrowed, signaling potential challenges for centrist Democrats.</p>

Museums will have 120 days to amend any content deemed inappropriate.
