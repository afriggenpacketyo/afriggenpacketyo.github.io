          <p>Jen Easterly, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under President Biden, had her appointment to a distinguished chair position at West Point rescinded. The decision followed public criticism from pro-Trump activist Laura Loomer, who accused Easterly of undermining the Trump administration. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll ordered the rescission and a review of the hiring process, a move Easterly described as a casualty of "casually manufactured outrage." This incident has raised concerns about political influence over military academic institutions.</p>

          <p>In recent remarks, President Trump described Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine as a "disgrace," attributing the conflict to the Biden administration while noting the high number of Russian casualties. He confirmed the U.S. would impose sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire is not reached soon, though he expressed skepticism about their effectiveness on President Putin. Separately, when questioned about the Jeffrey Epstein case, Trump stated he was unaware of Epstein's motives for hiring young women from his Mar-a-Lago club and reiterated that he had expelled Epstein from the property upon learning of it.</p>

          <p>For individuals with significant savings, choosing between a high-yield savings account and a money market account is a key decision in the current economic climate. This article provides a comparative analysis, calculating potential interest earnings on a $20,000 deposit over various timeframes. While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher rates on average, the difference in earnings can be minimal. Therefore, savers should also consider other features, such as the check-writing capabilities often available with money market accounts, to determine the best fit for their financial needs.

          <p>Several federal judges have spoken out about a disturbing increase in threats, harassment, and intimidation tactics they have faced, often following rulings related to the Trump administration. Judges reported receiving death threats, being "swatted," and being targeted by "pizza doxxing," where unsolicited pizzas were sent to their homes in the name of a murdered judge's son. The jurists linked the hostile environment to inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders who attack the judiciary. They called for a de-escalation of such language and urged lawyers and colleagues to defend the independence of the courts.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly drawing down the force deployed by the Trump administration to address protests against immigration raids. Initially, 5,000 troops were sent, a move met with strong opposition and a lawsuit from California officials who argued the deployment was unnecessary and drained resources from other duties. While 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, state and local leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass, applauded the withdrawal and are pressuring for a full demobilization.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the nation's parliament have overturned a law that would have curtailed the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came after days of large-scale protests across Ukraine, led primarily by young people who feared the law would jeopardize the country's path toward European Union integration. The original bill had been seen as a threat to the anti-corruption reforms required by Western partners for continued financial aid. The successful protests demonstrated the power of civil society in holding the government accountable, even during wartime.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reported second-quarter revenue that missed analyst estimates, causing its stock to fall in after-hours trading. While the company's net income rose significantly due to gains on its crypto investments, revenue from transactions was weaker than anticipated. The slowdown in retail trading volume, compared to the exuberant first quarter, contributed to the miss. Subscription and services revenue also grew but failed to meet projections, indicating that the company's efforts to diversify have yet to fully offset the volatility of the trading market.

Experts suggest that, given her age and the nature of her 2024 election loss, she will likely pursue a public-facing role to remain politically relevant, potentially including another presidential run in 2028. In the meantime, she could follow the path of other post-White House figures by starting a foundation, writing books, launching a podcast, or championing a specific cause like artificial intelligence.

This article explores whether these gadgets are truly effective at providing relief. While they can create a localized cooling sensation by circulating air across the skin on the neck and face, their overall impact on core body temperature is limited. Their effectiveness often depends on ambient humidity and personal comfort levels, serving more as a psychological comfort than a significant physiological cooling solution in extreme heat conditions.</p>
