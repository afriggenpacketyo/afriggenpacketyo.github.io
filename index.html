            <h2>Energy Secretary Argues for Keeping Coal Plants Operational Amid Rising Electricity Needs</h2>

            <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright advocates for maintaining coal plants to meet growing electricity demands from AI data centers and other industries, citing the need for reliable and affordable energy sources. This stance comes as President Trump prepares to sign an order classifying coal as a critical mineral, aiming to facilitate its extraction on federal lands and expand electricity output by 25%. Wright emphasizes that all secure sources are needed, with coal being central, and Trump suggests coal as a backup for data centers, potentially using emergency powers to expedite power plant construction. The administration believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs to the US.</p>

There is significant support for allowing all state residents to purchase health insurance through Covered California and offering food assistance to all eligible low-income families, irrespective of immigration status, contrasting with the anti-immigrant rhetoric from the White House.</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the US will get fair deals, as President Trump's tariffs on trading partners continue to impact global markets. Trump has dismissed pausing tariffs for negotiations and threatens additional tariffs on China for retaliatory measures. A senior White House official mentioned a potential total tariff of 104% on Chinese goods. This comes as Trump aims to expand electricity output by 25% and uses tariffs to bring jobs back to the U.S. Bessent believes tariffs will decline as manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S.</p>

            <p>Cambodia is facing an existential crisis for its factories and workers due to a 49% tariff imposed by the Trump administration, the highest tariff rate in the new trade plan. Despite the goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., it is unlikely to happen as manufacturers are looking to move their supply chains to other countries like Egypt, India, and Indonesia. The Cambodian government is working on fiscal policies to mitigate the pressure, but no new orders are being placed due to uncertainty.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that ratcheting up trade barriers would not be in the country's interests, but acknowledged the importance of backing British producers. The government is keeping its options open for retaliating to US tariffs if necessary, but prefers negotiating an arrangement to mitigate the tariffs. New reforms to procurement rules aim to enable more British businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to win government contracts.</p>

            <p>President Trump is expected to sign executive orders aimed at reviving coal, allowing older coal-fired power plants to remain open despite their scheduled retirement. This move is in response to increased U.S. power demand from data centers, AI, and electric cars. Environmentalists criticize the decision, highlighting the declining competitiveness of coal compared to cheaper renewables and gas. The orders will also direct federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining, and prioritize coal leasing, contrasting with the Biden administration's climate rules.</p>

While Barclays maintains targets for its global staff, the US rollback reflects concerns about the changed environment in the US, and this follows similar moves by other large corporations.

            <p>With the U.S. economic outlook appearing bleak, experts advise Americans to build up a financial buffer. Younger individuals should continue saving and avoid panicking about their 401(k)s, while older individuals should prioritize liquid savings. Those with low savings should cut back on non-essential spending, and retirees should review their investment risk. Affluent individuals may consider investing in assets, but widespread saving could lead to a self-fulfilling recession.

            <p>Porsche's sales experienced a steep decline in the first three months of the year, as a surge in North American deliveries was overshadowed by falls in Europe and China. The German car manufacturer reported a 37% rise in North American deliveries, but a 42% drop in China, 34% in Germany, and 10% in the rest of Europe. Overall, deliveries of Porsche cars fell by 8%. The slowdown comes amid Trump's tariffs on car imports and broader concerns about consumer spending and electric vehicle competition.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary stay on a midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that a federal court cannot order the president to engage in foreign diplomacy. Abrego Garcia, despite having protected legal status, was sent to a mega-prison in El Salvador due to an administrative error. The Supreme Court requested a response from Garcia's attorneys by Tuesday, and the case involves allegations of gang membership.</p>
