        <h2>Tesla Stock Recovers After Significant Drop</h2>

        <p>Tesla's stock experienced its worst day since 2020 on Monday, dropping 15.4%.  However, it rebounded with nearly 8% growth on Wednesday, following a 3.8% increase on Tuesday.  The initial drop was attributed to investor sell-offs in technology shares, fueled by recession fears and tariff uncertainty.  Tesla's recent decline has erased over 40% of its market value since President Trump's inauguration, although postelection rallies were seen due to CEO Elon Musk's ties to the president.  Tariff concerns remain a significant factor, threatening key supplier markets.</p>

        <p>The Department of Education conducted mass layoffs affecting approximately 1,315 employees, representing a nearly 50% reduction.  The cuts impacted all departments but disproportionately affected the Offices for Civil Rights and Federal Student Aid.  Employees express concerns about the impact on services for disabled students and the overall operational capacity of the department.  Secretary of Education Linda McMahon defends the layoffs as eliminating bureaucratic bloat while ensuring the continuation of critical programs. President Trump also commented on the layoffs.</p>

        <p>A federal judge is considering a challenge to the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and lawful permanent resident, who was transferred to an immigration detention center in Louisiana after his arrest in New York.  His detention has sparked controversy regarding free speech.  The judge will determine whether the transfer violated the law, given the pending challenge in New York.  Khalil's attorneys argue his detention is politically motivated, while government officials claim it's not about free speech but rather his alleged support for Hamas and involvement in campus protests.  The judge ordered a private call between Khalil and his attorneys.</p>

        <p>US inflation eased more than anticipated in February, with the Consumer Price Index up 2.8% year-over-year and 0.2% month-over-month.  The core inflation measure also decreased.  This is considered positive news for the Federal Reserve, although the situation remains complex due to rising prices for some consumer staples and falling costs in other areas, such as airfares.</p>

        <h2>Impact of Inflation Drop on Mortgage Rates</h2>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>February's inflation decrease to 2.8% offers some hope for mortgage rates, although it's not the only factor influencing them.  While mortgage brokers are positive about the trend, significant rate drops aren't expected immediately.  A continued decline in inflation in future reports could lead to more noticeable decreases.  Experts offer differing opinions on whether rates will fall below 6% by the end of the year, and advise against waiting for lower rates before buying a home.</p>

        <p>President Trump is aggressively challenging the established norms and constraints on executive power.  He's taking actions that are being challenged in court, including firing inspectors general, attempting to control independent agencies, and pushing the boundaries of executive authority.  Legal scholars offer differing perspectives on the legality and implications of his actions, with some arguing it's an attempt to restore a more powerful executive branch, while others express concerns about the erosion of checks and balances and potential for abuse of power.</p>

        <p>New tariffs on steel and aluminum are increasing costs for automakers, even those who source domestically.  The tariffs apply without exceptions and add to existing challenges from tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports.  Industry experts discuss the impact on suppliers and the overall cost increases for the auto industry.  The situation is further complicated by the potential for additional tariffs.</p>
