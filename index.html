          <p>A biologically male transgender athlete is set to compete in the California girls' track and field state championship, having qualified in both the long jump and triple jump events. This has ignited controversy, with some parents and athletes expressing concern over fairness and lost opportunities for female athletes. A parent of a female jumper stated she has witnessed this occur at the last three track meets, watching female athletes lose opportunities to a biological male. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) is under federal investigation for allegedly violating federal civil rights law by allowing the athlete to compete and retaliating against protesting athletes.

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka started her French Open campaign impressively, defeating Kamilla Rakhimova in straight sets. Sabalenka only needed an hour to win the match, displaying dominant form with five aces and breaking her opponent's serve five times. As a three-time Grand Slam singles champion, Sabalenka has never reached the final of the French Open, with her best performance being a semi-final run in 2023. This victory justifies her position as one of the favorites for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's beloved pav bread, a staple for the working class, faces an uncertain future as the government plans to ban wood-fired bakeries due to pollution concerns. A study claims that these bakeries contribute significantly to air pollution, prompting the proposed ban. However, critics argue that this measure unfairly targets small businesses and that other sources of pollution, such as construction sites, contribute far more significantly. Bakers fear that switching to cleaner fuels like natural gas or electricity would increase the cost of pav, impacting the working class who rely on it as an affordable food source.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's approach to dismantling American democratic institutions by turning them against themselves. The author argues that Trump is systematically repurposing liberal institutions, such as the judiciary, legislature, and federal bureaucracy, to undermine democracy. This involves exploiting legal loopholes, polarizing institutions, and attacking higher education to create an "autoimmune disorder" within the American system. The analysis draws on historical context and the ideas of Max Weber to illustrate how Trump's actions threaten the foundations of liberal modernity.</p>

          <p>A civil war has erupted among Democratic policy wonks over the "abundance agenda," a set of reforms aimed at easing building and bureaucratic processes to boost prosperity. Supporters see it as key to American progress and liberal power, while critics denounce it as a corporate-aligned attack on progressive values. The core of the dispute lies in the agenda's challenge to activist organizations that heavily influence the Democratic Party, particularly regarding housing, infrastructure, and government efficiency. This conflict highlights fundamental disagreements about the party's direction and who should control it.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government. The government is calling the move a "new dawn for rail," focusing on improving services and investing in infrastructure, but not promising lower fares. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing staffing, while the opposition Conservatives have called for Labour to deliver on their promises. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander described the nationalization of SWR as a "real watershed moment."</p>

          <p>An attack on a Palm Springs fertility clinic has surfaced unsettling ideas related to "anti-natalism," a fringe movement holding that procreation is immoral due to the inevitability of death and suffering. The suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus, identified himself as a "pro-mortalist" before detonating his vehicle, resulting in his death and injuries to others. This incident has brought attention to the growing online presence of anti-natalist discussions and their potential influence on extremist actions, while experts clarify that mainstream anti-natalism abhors violence.</p>

          <p>Businesses are struggling with unstable tariff rates, bond-market swings, canceled federal contracts, rising import costs, and visa challenges, leading to an "era of thrash." While the American economy has shown resilience, economists measure heightened uncertainty through newspaper coverage, stock-market volatility, and corporate communications. Despite these challenges, Americans are forming more businesses than before the pandemic, but the article suggests that the country is more vulnerable and less resilient than it was a couple of years ago.</p>
