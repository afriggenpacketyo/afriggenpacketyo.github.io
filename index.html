          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:08:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phoenix firefighters are using a low-tech but highly effective method to treat severe heatstroke by immersing victims in ice water. This technique, originally developed by the military, can cool a person's core body temperature three to five times faster than traditional methods, preventing organ failure and brain damage. The program's success during a trial period, which saw a drop in heat-related deaths despite a record hot summer, has led to its expansion across the city. This innovative approach is now being seen as a national model as climate change intensifies heatwaves.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a proposal to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action, claiming it would save billions, while critics argue it ignores overwhelming scientific evidence and would dismantle crucial climate protections. The decision is expected to face significant legal challenges from environmental groups who argue the move is illegal and dangerous. The reversal would undermine regulations that the EPA's own reports valued at over $2 trillion in net benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The four individuals killed in the Park Avenue office shooting have been identified, including an off-duty NYPD officer, a Blackstone executive, a security guard, and a recent Cornell graduate. The gunman, who police believe was targeting the NFL offices in the building, also injured an NFL employee before taking his own life. A note found on the gunman suggested he blamed the NFL for a traumatic head injury and believed he had CTE. The victims are being mourned by their families and employers, with Blackstone remembering executive Wesley LePatner as a "beloved member" of their family.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the Trump administration's policies. The complaint, initiated by Attorney General Pam Bondi, accuses the judge of making improper public comments critical of the administration and mishandling a case involving the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. Judge Boasberg had previously criticized the administration for its "obstructionism" and "willful disregard" of his court orders in that case. This action represents a rare instance of the executive branch formally challenging a sitting federal judge, raising concerns about judicial independence.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that his government will formally recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the war in Gaza. This conditional recognition is intended to pressure Israel into agreeing to a ceasefire, allowing unimpeded humanitarian aid, and committing to a sustainable two-state solution. The announcement follows a similar move by France and comes amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the decision, stating it "rewards Hamas' monstrous terrorism" and undermines efforts to release hostages.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are tied as the top contenders, each with 24% of the vote, closely followed by National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett at 22%. The survey comes amid President Trump's repeated criticism of current Chair Jerome Powell, although most respondents believe the president will not fire Powell before his term ends. The political pressure is seen by 42% of respondents as making interest rate cuts less likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To combat a projected shortage of up to 40,000 primary care physicians by 2036, some U.S. medical schools are offering accelerated three-year MD programs. These fast-track options, available at 33 schools, compress the standard four-year curriculum for students committed to general medicine, allowing them to enter residency a year earlier. Proponents argue this model produces competent physicians more quickly, saves students a year of tuition, and helps them start earning sooner. Furthermore, some programs report that a high percentage of their graduates go on to practice in underserved or rural communities, directly addressing critical healthcare gaps.</p>

This decision is being viewed by some experts and Democratic lawmakers as a significant diplomatic concession to China, which opposes any official U.S. contact with Taiwanese leaders.

          <p>Recent polling indicates that tax cuts may no longer be the guaranteed political winner they once were, with a majority of Americans opposing the latest Republican tax bill. This shift is attributed to several factors, including a lower overall tax burden compared to past decades and sharply increased income inequality, which makes voters skeptical of policies that primarily benefit the wealthy. Furthermore, the long-held argument that tax cuts pay for themselves through economic growth has been repeatedly disproven, and voters remain concerned about the national debt.

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, filling a leadership void at the public health agency. Monarez, a health scientist and the first non-medical doctor to lead the agency in decades, takes over an organization reportedly in turmoil due to staff departures and funding cuts. In her confirmation hearing, she emphasized restoring public trust, modernizing infrastructure, and ensuring recommendations are based on science. However, she faces the challenge of balancing public health principles with the agenda of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is set to host the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on December 5, according to multiple reports. The city was reportedly chosen after potential venues in co-host nations Canada and Mexico were ruled out. The draw will determine the groups for the expanded 48-team tournament, which is being jointly held across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Sphere, a futuristic entertainment venue known for its massive LED screen, is considered the leading candidate to stage the high-profile event. This marks a return of the World Cup draw to Las Vegas, which also hosted the ceremony in 1994.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious summer fruit, health experts caution that eating too much can lead to negative side effects. Due to its high content of certain sugars known as FODMAPs, excessive consumption can cause digestive issues like bloating, particularly for those with irritable bowel syndrome. The fruit also contains tyramine, an amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Additionally, its natural sugar content means people with diabetes should be mindful of their portion sizes to avoid significant impacts on their blood sugar levels. A balanced diet remains key.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The mass shooting in Manhattan has drawn attention to the gun laws of Nevada, the home state of the 27-year-old gunman. The shooter legally purchased a revolver and held a concealed weapon permit issued in Nevada, a state with a B- rating for its gun laws. Since the 2017 Las Vegas massacre, Nevada has enacted stricter measures, including universal background checks and a "red flag" law allowing temporary firearm removal from individuals deemed a danger. However, the state still permits open carry and does not ban assault-style weapons like the M4-style rifle used in the attack.</p>

          <p>According to a Reuters report, the security camera system at 345 Park Avenue flagged the gunman as a potential threat seconds before he entered and opened fire. A still image from the footage reportedly shows a computer-generated box around the man, indicating that threat-detection software had identified his rifle and was alerting security staff. This previously unreported detail raises questions about the building's security response and whether the attack, which killed four people, could have been thwarted or mitigated.

          <p>Former NBA player Marcus Morris Sr. was denied bond in a Florida court following his arrest on felony fraud charges originating from Nevada. The charges stem from two warrants alleging he passed fraudulent checks and committed theft of over $100,000 in each case. During the hearing, a prosecutor confirmed the charges relate to two outstanding casino markers, each for more than $100,000. Morris's attorney stated that a large payment had been wired to resolve the issue, and Nevada is reportedly willing to consider dismissing the charges if the debts are paid in full.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed that his falling out with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was because Epstein "stole" employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking to reporters, Trump confirmed that these employees were young women who worked at the spa, and suggested that prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre was one of them. Giuffre has stated she was hired away from Mar-a-Lago by Epstein's accomplice in 2000 when she was 16. Trump's comments complicate the White House's previous timeline, which suggested he broke with Epstein around 2004, as Trump spoke highly of Epstein in a 2002 interview.</p>

The move highlights the increasing importance of cybersecurity as AI advancements create new threats. Palo Alto Networks has been an active acquirer, but a CyberArk purchase would represent a significantly larger bet on securing enterprise technology stacks. (not investment advice)</p>
