          <p>National Public Radio has filed a lawsuit against President Trump over his executive order to cease federal funding for the broadcaster, citing First Amendment violations and congressional authority infringement. NPR argues that the order punishes news coverage deemed 'biased' and threatens the public radio system. The lawsuit emphasizes that Congress intended for public funding to support private speech protected from government interference. NPR contends that the order violates these rights by attempting to control journalistic activities and expressive association, potentially impacting millions of Americans who rely on public radio for news and information. The legal challenge aims to permanently block the order and declare it unconstitutional.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Congress are pushing to revive the depleted American shipbuilding industry to compete with China, the world’s biggest ship maker, with potential subsidies and penalties. Hanwha Philly Shipyard's CEO, David Kim, asserts the American shipbuilding industry is ready but needs a steady stream of orders and government support. Trump issued an executive order and new rules penalizing Chinese ships and requiring certain vessels to be built in the U.S. However, challenges include limited shipyard capacity, longer production times, and higher costs compared to Asian shipyards, and critics are wary of repeating past failures. The efforts aim to create a strategic commercial fleet of American-made vessels operated by American crews.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has outlined proposals to make it easier for people to have children, including more generous tax breaks for married couples and scrapping the two-child benefit limit. Farage argues that lifting the cap would help lower-paid workers and that making marriage more important would give children the best chance of success. He also aims to raise the income tax threshold to £20,000, funded by cutting net-zero measures and ending diversity initiatives. Critics argue that these proposals are expensive and lack a clear funding plan, and that the party would need to make the numbers add up if they were to be a party of government.</p>

          <p>Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, remains imprisoned amidst what his party, PTI, claims are politically motivated charges. Despite having a strong support base, Khan's chances of release and return to power appear slim following recent clashes with India that have boosted the military's image. Analysts suggest the military leadership is unlikely to offer Khan a deal, while voices within PTI express hope for his eventual release through court acquittals or backdoor negotiations. Khan himself denies any ongoing talks with the government or military, with his future largely dependent on his own behavior and the resolution of numerous pending cases.</p>

The General Services Administration plans to instruct agencies to review and potentially cancel approximately $100 million in contracts.

This action follows accusations from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on foreign students and fostered an unsafe environment for Jewish students, as well as promoting pro-Hamas sympathies.</p>

Sales of Tesla vehicles in 32 European countries fell to 7,261, a 49% decrease from the previous year. This drop is attributed to backlash against CEO Elon Musk, an aging model lineup, and intensifying competition, particularly from Chinese EV brands. The trade war between Trump and Europe has also deterred Europeans from buying American brands, and Tesla had to shut down factories to upgrade its Model Y, affecting supply.</p>

As of May 27, 2025, the price of gold is $3,299.24 per ounce, though it is subject to fluctuations due to supply and demand, economic conditions, and geopolitical events. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge, with its price inversely proportional to interest rates.

          <p>New research reveals that groundwater depletion in the Colorado River Basin has reached critical levels, driven by heavy pumping for agriculture and exacerbated by prolonged drought and rising temperatures. Since 2003, the basin has lost a quantity of groundwater comparable to the total capacity of Lake Mead. Most of the depletion occurs in the river's lower basin, particularly in Arizona, where groundwater is used to irrigate farms. The researchers caution that continued groundwater losses could lead to severe water shortages, impacting local farmers, residents, and broader agricultural markets.</p>
