          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a "very good phone call" discussing trade issues, leading to an agreement for US and Chinese negotiating teams to meet soon at a location to be determined. Trump said the call, lasting about 90 minutes, focused on the intricacies of their recently agreed-upon trade deal and resulted in a positive conclusion for both countries. Xi Jinping extended an invitation to Trump and the First Lady to visit China, which Trump reciprocated, emphasizing the importance of this relationship between the two nations. The call occurred amidst a 90-day tariff truce initiated last month, during which the US reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%.</p>

This is their first in-person meeting since Merz became chancellor last month. Trade and tariffs are expected to be a primary focus, especially with Trump's 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union set to take effect on July 9, prompting the EU to prepare countermeasures. Merz emphasized the importance of the alliance between Germany and the United States for the security, freedom, and prosperity of Europe.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Kennedy stated that individuals should have access to experimental therapies, including unregulated stem cell treatments. This stance comes despite concerns that some unproven methods have resulted in serious harm, such as blindness and tumors. Kennedy argues that people should have the freedom to explore these options, even if the safety and efficacy are not fully established. This perspective has sparked debate within the medical community, highlighting the tension between patient autonomy and the need for rigorous scientific validation of medical interventions.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares dropped approximately 4% as CEO Elon Musk continued to publicly criticize President Trump's spending bill. Musk has threatened to primary lawmakers who support the bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination," which marks a notable shift in his commentary on the administration. Despite the recent stock rally in May, Tesla shares are still down more than 20% this year. Walter Isaacson, who wrote a book about Musk, noted that Musk is "seriously upset" and fully committed to his stance against the bill, showcasing his volatile relationship with the administration after his term as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously blocked Mexico's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, delivering a win for the firearms industry. Mexico argued that gun manufacturers knowingly aided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to straw purchasers, who then trafficked them to drug cartels. The court rejected this argument, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields gun manufacturers from liability for the misuse of their products. Justice Elena Kagan stated that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted the unlawful sales.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against at her job with the Ohio Department of Youth Services. The decision effectively lowers the burden of proof required for members of a majority group to make discrimination claims. Ames argued she was denied a promotion and then demoted because her employer favored LGBTQ staff members, but lower courts ruled she did not provide sufficient evidence. Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson wrote the unanimous opinion, stating that anti-discrimination laws should apply equally to all Americans, regardless of their identity.</p>

The court upheld a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if their products are misused, stating that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales to Mexican traffickers.

Justice Elena Kagan noted that Congress enacted the law to prevent gun companies from being sued for harms caused by the misuse of firearms by third parties. The court acknowledged Mexico's severe problem with gun violence originating north of the border, but stated that the lawsuit lacked evidence that the gun companies knowingly and deliberately helped criminals buy guns to be sent into Mexico.</p>

          <p>US imports experienced a record 20% plunge in April due to tariffs imposed by President Trump. Purchases from major trade partners like Canada and China fell to their lowest levels in years, leading to a significant reduction in the US trade deficit. Trump's tariffs, intended to rebuild domestic manufacturing and strengthen trade negotiations, have raised the average effective tariff rate to the highest level since the 1930s. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump recently spoke by phone to address these trade issues, as the fragile truce between the two countries showed signs of weakening. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is attributing the Colorado attack to his predecessor’s “ridiculous Open Border Policy,” citing the entry of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national charged with a federal hate crime. The administration has labeled Soliman an “illegal alien,” despite him entering the U.S. on a visa and applying for asylum. The article argues that Trump is using the attack to justify mass-deportation efforts, even though Soliman's case is not straightforward. The article notes Trump's differing responses to anti-Semitic violence depending on the perpetrator's immigration status.</p>

The USAID NTD Program, created in 2006, has been effective in delivering treatments and helping countries eliminate NTDs, with the CDC calling it one of the "best buys" in global health.

Ernst later posted an apology video, but it was filmed in a cemetery, which some found inappropriate.

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting entry from 12 countries, has been designed to avoid the legal challenges faced by his previous attempt. Legal experts note that the new ban is more legally robust, with wider scope and clearly defined exemptions. Unlike the previous ban, which targeted predominantly Muslim countries, the new order does not explicitly target Muslim-majority states. Experts suggest that the new ban is likely to be upheld by the Supreme Court, if challenged.</p>
