          <p>Republicans won two Florida special elections for US House seats, defying Democratic hopes for upsets.  The victories, in heavily Republican districts, solidify the GOP's hold on the House.  While the margins were narrower than in the November elections, Democrats highlighted their improved performance.  The results have implications for the ongoing negotiations in Congress regarding Trump's legislative agenda.</p>

          <p>In a first for China's Communist Party, Politburo members Li Ganjie and Shi Taifeng swapped their positions.  Li Ganjie took over the United Front Work Department, while Shi Taifeng became the head of the Organisation Department.  The unusual swap has no precedent and breaks with the typical five-year term length for such roles.
