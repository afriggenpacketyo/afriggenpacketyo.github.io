          <p>Salesforce's stock has underperformed significantly this year, dropping 25% while competitor Oracle has surged. Investors are concerned about the company's single-digit sales growth and are looking for signs of a turnaround, particularly through its AI initiatives like Agentforce. The company is also facing renewed pressure from activist investors to improve profitability and its growth trajectory. While some shareholders remain confident in the company's long-term value, the upcoming earnings report is seen as a critical moment for CEO Marc Benioff to outline a clear path forward.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains two primary methods for managing significant credit card debt: debt consolidation loans and debt consolidation programs. A loan involves taking out a new, single loan with a lower interest rate to pay off multiple debts, simplifying payments. A program, offered by a debt relief company, functions similarly but involves the company negotiating on the borrower's behalf, which may be more accessible for those with imperfect credit. The best option depends on an individual's credit score and financial situation, and both can potentially improve credit utilization ratios. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For taxpayers facing significant debt to the IRS, several resolution pathways are available beyond immediate full payment. Options include working with a tax debt relief service to negotiate a repayment plan or utilizing an "offer in compromise" to settle for less than the full amount if facing severe financial hardship. Other solutions are installment agreements for manageable monthly payments, temporary collection delays, and penalty abatements for those with reasonable cause for late payment. The article stresses that proactive communication with the IRS is crucial to finding a manageable solution. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article clarifies that while there are no government-sponsored credit card debt forgiveness programs, consumers struggling with overwhelming balances have options. One method is debt settlement, where a company negotiates with creditors to accept a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed, though this can negatively impact credit scores. Bankruptcy is presented as a more drastic last resort that can completely eliminate debt but has severe, long-term credit implications. The article also suggests alternatives like consolidation loans and financial hardship programs offered directly by lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tow truck driver in Los Angeles has been federally charged after he towed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicle that was actively being used in an operation to arrest an undocumented immigrant. According to the criminal complaint, the driver, Bobby Nunez, was laughing and filming the incident while agents had their emergency lights on. Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli stated that Nunez could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The event highlights ongoing tensions in Los Angeles surrounding federal immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back low-income customers who have reduced their spending due to inflation. The fast-food giant noted a significant drop in traffic from this demographic and sluggish breakfast sales. Starting September 8, the menu will feature deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. This move reflects a broader trend of consumer pullback, as other companies like Constellation Brands have also reported decreased demand due to economic pressures on households.</p>

Savers are also urged to monitor the rate climate closely, as banks may lower their rates preemptively.

Continuing to work before reaching full retirement age while earning above a certain threshold can lead to temporary benefit reductions. Benefits can also be garnished to pay off federal debts like back taxes or student loans, and a significant portion can be subject to income tax depending on one's total income. Finally, changes in eligibility, such as a divorced spouse remarrying before age 60 or failing to provide verification documents, can also impact payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Predict Muted Impact on Mortgage Rates from Expected September Fed Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:08:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate in September, homeowners and buyers should temper their expectations for a significant drop in mortgage rates. The anticipated cut is only a modest 25 basis points, which is likely to have a minimal immediate effect. Furthermore, many lenders may have already priced this anticipated cut into their current mortgage rate offerings. The article also notes that mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's actions, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, meaning a single small cut won't cause a dramatic decline.

          <p>A French anesthetist, Frederic Pechier, is on trial accused of poisoning 30 patients, 12 of whom died, between 2008 and 2017. Prosecutors allege that Pechier intentionally tampered with his colleagues' anesthesia pouches to trigger medical emergencies, such as cardiac arrest, during surgeries. The motive was supposedly to demonstrate his superior resuscitation skills and discredit his co-workers. Pechier, who faces a potential life sentence if convicted, has denied all charges, claiming the incidents were the result of medical errors by others. The case has shocked the French medical community.</p>

          <p>As discussions of potential peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia continue, many residents in the frontline Donbas region are firmly against the idea of territorial concessions. Despite enduring constant shelling and the hardships of war, locals interviewed expressed that giving up land would render the immense sacrifices of the conflict meaningless. Soldiers and civilians alike voiced skepticism about Russia's intentions, believing that any concession would only lead to further demands. The sentiment on the ground reflects a deep-seated resolve to defend their land, even as the human cost of the war continues to mount.</p>

          <p>Spending on political advertising for the 2025-2026 midterm election cycle is projected to reach a record $10.8 billion, a 20% increase over the 2022 midterms. According to a report from AdImpact, the growth is largely driven by a surge in spending on connected TV (CTV) and streaming services, which is expected to hit $2.5 billion. While broadcast television will still command the largest share of ad dollars, the competitiveness of key congressional races is fueling the overall increase. Early spending for the cycle has already surpassed previous records, indicating an intensely contested political environment.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, has arrived in Beijing to attend a major military parade marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. His daughter's prominent appearance further fuels speculation that she is being positioned as his eventual successor. The event, hosted by China's Xi Jinping, will also be attended by Russia's Vladimir Putin, showcasing a display of solidarity among the leaders.

South Korea's intelligence agency believes she is the most likely successor, though details about her remain scarce, including her exact age. Her introduction to the world stage is seen by some analysts as a strategic move to legitimize a future female leader in the deeply patriarchal state.</p>

Her retirement opens up a competitive race for her seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent years. Ernst had recently faced criticism from both Democrats and members of her own party, and her departure is expected to draw a crowded field of candidates from both parties ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

This move aims to address the massive backlog of approximately 3.5 million cases in the nation's immigration courts.

The DOJ's motion argues that the plaintiffs have not exhausted administrative remedies and that the U.S. has sovereign immunity from such claims, a move the defendants see as a betrayal.</p>
