          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump concluded without an agreement for the supply of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Trump expressed a desire to avoid escalating the conflict, suggesting the war could end soon without the need for such advanced weaponry. While discussions on the matter will continue, Trump remained non-committal, emphasizing the U.S. need for the missiles for its own defense. Zelensky, who had hoped the missiles could target Russian energy infrastructure, described his outlook as "realistic" following the talks.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has firmly positioned the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as the main political opponent for his conservative Christian Democrats (CDU). He rejected any cooperation, stating the AfD's goal is to destroy the CDU, thereby reinforcing the so-called "firewall" between the mainstream conservative party and the far-right. Merz also attributed the AfD's rise in popularity partly to the migration policies of his predecessors, Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz. His stance comes amid calls from within his own party to reconsider the ban on collaborating with the AfD, given its growing strength.</p>

In the decisive Game 4, Ohtani hit three solo home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out ten batters over six shutout innings. This dominant display, hailed as one of the greatest in postseason history, earned him the NLCS MVP award. The Dodgers now advance to the World Series for the fifth time in nine seasons, aiming to be the first repeat champions in 25 years.</p>

Pratika's talent was evident from a young age, and she has since become a consistent performer for the national team, boasting a high batting average. Her success is a testament to her dedication and the crucial backing of her family and coaches in pursuing a professional sports career.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has described the cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods as unsustainable, even while defending the protectionist measures as necessary. This acknowledgement comes as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare for a new round of trade negotiations in Malaysia, aimed at preventing further economic conflict. The talks follow recent escalations, including China's expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and Trump's threats of 100% tariffs in retaliation. Both sides are seeking to de-escalate tensions and find a resolution before a current tariff truce agreement expires on November 10. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test could significantly accelerate the diagnosis of more than 50 types of cancer by detecting cancerous DNA fragments in the bloodstream. Results from a North American trial involving 25,000 adults showed the test successfully identified a wide range of cancers, three-quarters of which currently lack any screening program. More than half of the cancers were detected at an early, more treatable stage, suggesting the test could fundamentally change cancer screening approaches. The NHS is currently conducting a larger trial, with results expected next year to determine its future implementation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former U.S. Congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release after serving less than three months of a seven-year term for fraud. Trump cited Santos's consistent Republican voting record and alleged mistreatment in prison as reasons for the commutation. The move drew praise from some Republican allies but was sharply criticized by other GOP members and Democrats, who argued that the short sentence did not constitute justice for his crimes.

          <h2>Alaska Storm Evacuees May Be Displaced for Over a Year Due to Severe Damage</h2>

          <p>Officials report that the damage from a recent storm in remote Alaskan villages is so severe that many of the 2,000 displaced residents may not be able to return home for at least 18 months. The storm, with the force of a Category 2 hurricane, destroyed a high percentage of homes in several communities, with one village seeing 90% of its residences lost. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from the White House to secure federal aid. Evacuees are currently being housed in shelters and are facing the prospect of long-term relocation and starting new lives in larger cities like Anchorage.</p>

          <h2>Alibaba Cloud Develops System to Drastically Reduce Nvidia GPU Usage for AI Models</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 23:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced a new computing pooling system, named Aegaeon, which it claims can reduce the number of Nvidia GPUs needed to serve AI models by up to 82%. During a three-month test in its model marketplace, the system cut the required high-end GPUs from 1,192 to just 213. The technology addresses a major inefficiency in cloud services, where many GPUs are allocated to AI models that are only used sporadically. This innovation aims to significantly lower the high operational costs associated with serving a large number of concurrent large language models.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that prosecutors must begin a retrial for Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted in the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, by June 1, 2026. If jury selection for what would be his third trial does not commence by that date, Hernandez will be released. His previous conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court, which found that the trial judge gave the jury incorrect instructions regarding his confession. Hernandez's attorneys have long maintained that his confession was false and a product of mental illness.</p>

          <p>Confrontations between protesters and Illinois state police outside the Broadview ICE detention center near Chicago resulted in at least 15 arrests. Tensions escalated when officers moved to clear a roadway after demonstrators advanced beyond designated protest zones. The clash is the latest in a series of volatile protests at the facility, where federal agents have previously used chemical irritants on crowds. The incident followed a new court order requiring federal agents in Illinois to wear body cameras during immigration operations, a ruling praised by the state's governor.</p>
