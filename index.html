        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Justice Secretary will now have the authority to veto new sentencing guidelines proposed by the independent Sentencing Council. This legislative change, part of the new Sentencing Bill, requires both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice to approve any guidelines before they are issued. The move follows a recent dispute where the government blocked guidance suggesting pre-sentence reports for offenders from certain minority groups, which ministers argued created "differential treatment." Proponents state this ensures democratic oversight, while critics may see it as an infringement on judicial independence.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy who survived the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis is scheduled for surgery to remove a bullet fragment from his neck. The boy, Weston Halsne, gained attention for his story of being shielded by a friend during the attack that injured 21 people. Doctors later discovered the fragment lodged dangerously close to his carotid artery. Despite the ordeal, his family reports he is in good spirits, and a fundraiser has been established to assist with medical expenses.</p>

          <p>Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China, former U.S. President Donald Trump sharply criticized the trade relationship between the United States and India, labeling it a "totally one sided disaster." In a social media post, Trump claimed India imposes excessively high tariffs on American goods and accused New Delhi of purchasing oil and arms from Russia. This statement comes amid strained relations, with the U.S. having recently imposed its own tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was flat and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced a slight decline amid the cautious atmosphere.

          <p>An opinion article highlights a growing trend among some intellectuals of comparing contemporary Western nations, particularly Britain, to the Soviet Union in its final years. The author notes that commentators are pointing to political rigidity, an unwillingness to question outdated dogma, and a managerial class disconnected from reality as parallels. The piece suggests that whether these comparisons are accurate or not, the mere perception of Western decline has significant global consequences. It reflects a broader anxiety about the stability and future of Anglo-American political and social structures.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the factors behind Liverpool FC's unprecedented £415 million summer spending spree, which set a new record for a single club in one transfer window. The club's shift in policy is attributed to a combination of circumstances, including a buildup of funds from a previous quiet window, significant commercial growth, and over £200 million in player sales. Seeking to capitalize on their recent Premier League title win, manager Arne Slot evolved the team with major signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak. The piece details the strategic decisions that transformed the club into the market's biggest spenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global food giant Nestle has fired its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after an investigation found he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced he will award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The decision comes just two days after Giuliani was seriously injured in a car crash and honors a figure known for his leadership of New York City after 9/11. However, the award is also controversial, given Giuliani's later role in spreading false claims about the 2020 election, which led to his disbarment and criminal charges. Trump praised Giuliani as a "great American Patriot" and the "greatest Mayor" in New York City's history.</p>

          <p>A recent study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new dating, achieved through advanced uranium-series techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and resolves decades of debate over its age. The fossil's features are distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans, strengthening the theory that it belongs to Homo heidelbergensis or a related archaic population. This finding suggests that different human lineages coexisted in Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of human evolution.</p>

The article contrasts their success with the case of Marc Guehi, who remained professional but saw his desired move to Liverpool collapse.
