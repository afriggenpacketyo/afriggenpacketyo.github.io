          <h2>Tesla Sales Dip Amidst Musk Backlash and Increased Competition</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's first-quarter 2025 sales saw a 13% drop compared to the previous year, reaching their lowest point in three years.  This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased competition from Chinese automaker BYD and a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's controversial political involvement in the Trump administration.  Some analysts even suggest Musk's actions have damaged the Tesla brand irreparably. The company attributes the drop to a transition to a new car version, but critics point to Musk's political activities.</p>
