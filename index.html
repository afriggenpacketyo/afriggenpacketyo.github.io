          <p>Since President Trump announced sweeping tariffs, indicators suggest rising economic anxiety, including a plunge in consumer confidence to near-record lows. Consumers are panic-buying products like cars and electronics before prices increase, while businesses anticipate a production slowdown, countering Trump's goal of reviving American manufacturing. Economists express concerns about the sustainability of increased spending and the potential for a recession, highlighting the negative impact of tariffs on both consumers and businesses. The uncertainty created by the tariffs is disrupting economic activity and undermining Trump's objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making by threatening to review $9 billion in federal funding.

          <p>Walt Disney's theme park business faces potential challenges due to a slump in air travel to the U.S., driven by President Trump's tariffs and anti-immigration policies, with international guests accounting for about 20% of park attendance. Declining foreign arrivals and cautious consumer sentiment are impacting Disney's operating income, while increased competition from Universal's new theme park adds further pressure. Despite near-term risks, Barclays sees potential offset from Disney's cruise business, leading to an upgrade of Disney's stock, with investors closely monitoring the company's upcoming quarterly earnings.

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating increasing tariff-free rice imports from the U.S. to approximately 410,000 tons from the existing 350,000 tons as part of negotiations concerning tariffs imposed by Washington. This proposal comes amid growing domestic demand in Japan for more affordable imported rice, driven by surging prices due to supply shortages. While this adjustment falls within Japan's minimum access commitment, it could potentially affect domestic rice prices and farmers' incomes. The move is part of ongoing trade discussions aimed at securing exemptions from U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
