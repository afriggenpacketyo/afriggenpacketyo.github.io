          <h2>Trump Announces Preliminary Trade Deal with Indonesia, Details Await Jakarta's Confirmation</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating it would set a 19% tariff on Indonesian U.S. exports while granting American firms "full access" to the Indonesian market, a benefit previously unavailable. As part of the purported agreement, Trump also claimed Indonesia committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. However, Jakarta has not yet confirmed these specific terms, and the Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to requests for comment, leaving the deal's finalization uncertain. This announcement closely resembles Trump's earlier, similarly detailed trade claims with Vietnam, which Vietnamese officials reportedly found surprising and have yet to formally accept.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was visibly upset during a game against the Connecticut Sun, engaging in a heated confrontation with WNBA official Mike Price, prompting an assistant coach to hold her back. She appeared to say, "Are you f----ing kidding me? That’s just rude. Grow up," as officials reviewed a play, yet she surprisingly avoided a technical foul. Clark, who has been working her way back from a groin injury, struggled with her shooting, finishing 1-for-7 from 3-point range, but did score nine straight points in the fourth quarter. She ultimately left the court in tears with under two minutes remaining after appearing to re-tweak her groin, raising health concerns ahead of the All-Star Game despite the Fever's 85-77 victory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of men convicted of serious violent crimes, including murder, homicide, and child sexual assault, to Eswatini, a small African country. This action is part of an aggressive, controversial effort by the U.S. to persuade various nations, regardless of their human rights records, to accept deportees who are not their own citizens. Critics argue that some receiving countries, like South Sudan, are unsafe, and the policy has sparked legal and humanitarian concerns regarding due process and potential incommunicado detention for deportees. The Supreme Court recently suspended a lower court ruling that required notice and due process before such third-country deportations, further expediting these removals.</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, stated that the departure of numerous Chinese academics and researchers from the United States, choosing to return to China, represents a "great loss" for America. Speaking during a visit to Beijing, Huang acknowledged his happiness for them returning home but emphasized the significant impact on the U.S. when "the brightest minds decide to come to you for education and decide to go home." As an immigrant himself, Huang expressed his hope that the United States continues to be a country where individuals can pursue the American dream, highlighting the importance of retaining global talent for national success.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced over $90 billion in new private company investments for Pennsylvania, targeting the development of a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging the state's significant technology and energy assets. These projects include the construction of data centers to power AI and an energy innovation center aimed at training workers for new energy and AI jobs, promising tens of thousands of new positions. The summit, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick and attended by numerous industry and cabinet leaders, seeks to establish the Pittsburgh region as a national hub for AI development. Despite these positive economic projections, the visit was met with protests from activists concerned about fossil fuel reliance and the ethical implications of AI.</p>

While a proposed $400 million cut to PEPFAR, a global AIDS prevention program, was removed, concerns persist regarding the impact on other humanitarian efforts and local public media.

          <p>The Trump administration reportedly delivered an ultimatum to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) board, demanding the firing of CEO Don Moul or facing their own dismissal. This directive, though not explicitly linked to a controversial gas plant project, is suspected by board members to be an excuse for President Trump to pursue the privatization of the TVA, the nation's largest public energy provider. The board resisted, arguing Moul's vision aligns with Trump's energy goals, but the administration is positioned to appoint new board members, potentially bypassing Senate confirmation. This political maneuvering revives speculation about the sale of the TVA, which critics warn could lead to higher electricity prices and hinder large-scale energy projects like nuclear reactor development.</p>

This unprecedented "Flonduran" hybrid aims to combat the severe decline of Florida's Elkhorn coral, over 95% of which has been wiped out by rising temperatures, coastal development, and disease. Scientists from the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium, in collaboration with Honduras-based Tela Marine, successfully planted these crossbred species in Florida, under protective umbrellas. The success of this effort is crucial, as robust coral reefs are vital for protecting South Florida's coastal communities from the impact of hurricane-fueled waves, highlighting a hopeful step in marine conservation.</p>

The charges have drawn public support from Donald Trump, who also threatened to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, a move that has sparked significant backlash from Brazil's government and business sector.</p>

          <p>Central banks worldwide are increasingly bolstering their gold reserves by purchasing directly from local mines, a strategic shift driven by soaring gold prices and geopolitical uncertainties. This method offers several advantages, including being cheaper than international market purchases, supporting local industry, and allowing countries to grow reserves without depleting foreign exchange. Nineteen out of 36 central banks surveyed by the World Gold Council are already engaged in such direct purchases, with more considering it. While concerns exist regarding labor practices in artisanal mining, central banks can leverage their buying power to formalize and improve the supply chain, creating a mutually beneficial arrangement for national economies and the mining sector.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer provided a candid review of the current earnings season, describing the stock market's "terrifying" ups and downs and acknowledging his own mixed performance. He highlighted Nvidia's stock surge following news that the White House would permit chip sales in China, a positive development for the AI powerhouse. However, Cramer expressed disappointment with BlackRock's earnings, noting investor focus on lower net inflows, and Wells Fargo's cut guidance for net interest income despite being free from a Federal Reserve asset cap. He conceded his "downright awful" one-for-three success rate this earnings season, emphasizing the unpredictable nature of market reactions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over two decades incarcerated for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County for his federal civil lawsuit. Torres's wrongful conviction stemmed from shaky witness testimony and ignored exculpatory evidence, including his consistent alibi of being at his mother's birthday party and the fact he wore a cast making it unlikely he could have fired a weapon. In 2022, a judge declared him factually innocent, clearing his record. This significant restitution, following a push from the California Innocence Project and the DA's Conviction Integrity Unit, aims to mitigate the profound harm caused by his unjust imprisonment and signifies accountability for systemic failures.</p>

          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the Australian man convicted of the 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio, has died from throat cancer at 67 while serving a life sentence in Alice Springs. Murdoch had consistently maintained his innocence and never revealed the location of Falconio's body, despite "no body, no parole" legislation that would have affected his eligibility. He was also convicted of the attempted kidnap and assault of Falconio's girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who remarkably escaped and provided crucial testimony. Northern Territory Police expressed deep regret that Murdoch's silence persists, denying the Falconio family the closure they have long deserved regarding their son's remains.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court ruling has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its efforts to significantly dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, including mass layoffs and a shift of power to states. Education Secretary Linda McMahon's mission is to reduce the federal government's role in schooling, with major cuts impacting the Financial Aid Office and the Office for Civil Rights. While most teachers and students may not directly perceive the daily impact due to the department's already limited federal scope, concerns are mounting regarding the diminished capacity for civil rights enforcement. Despite these reductions, the department is expected to remain in existence, as its closure would require an act of Congress.</p>

King, who had avoided the site due to his "visceral reaction" to the destruction, took several deep breaths before approaching the stump, noting the "big yawning gap" in the landscape. The landmark held profound personal significance for him and millions globally, serving as a place of peace and reflection. His visit, filmed for a documentary, was particularly poignant following the recent death of his Hairy Bikers partner, Dave Myers, as the tree's absence amplified his sense of loss.</p>

          <p>An independent review commissioned by Health Secretary Wes Streeting has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to prevent patient confusion regarding their roles. The review, based on evidence from doctors, patients, and the public, also suggests mandatory standardized clothing and badges to clearly distinguish them from qualified doctors, and emphasizes that PAs should not diagnose patients. This initiative addresses growing concerns about patient safety and the blurring of professional lines, highlighted by tragic cases where patients believed PAs were fully qualified doctors. While some patients expressed satisfaction, the British Medical Association supports clearer definitions to ensure appropriate care and training.</p>

          <p>Kew Gardens' iconic Palm House, a Victorian architectural marvel housing a tropical rainforest, is slated for a massive £50 million renovation that will see it close for five years starting in 2027. The ambitious project involves relocating 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and restoring hundreds of tonnes of rusting ironwork that have succumbed to the hot, humid conditions. A key objective is to achieve net-zero emissions by replacing existing gas boilers with air and water source heat pumps, making the challenging building significantly more sustainable without compromising its aesthetic. This comprehensive overhaul aims to preserve the 175-year-old structure and its invaluable botanical collection for future generations.</p>

          <p>An advertisement for Trip drinks has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for making unsubstantiated claims that its product could "help you feel calm" or reduce stress and anxiety. The ASA's investigation found that these claims, which referenced ingredients like magnesium and various "Mindful Blend" supplements, violated established rules for marketing food or drink ingredients with health benefits. Additionally, the watchdog determined that the ad's claim of "0g added sugar" was inaccurate. Trip has since removed the offending claims, but the ruling underscores the strict regulatory environment for health-related advertising and the necessity for companies to substantiate any purported benefits of their products.</p>

Smith argued that Cameron failed to prepare adequately for the implications of both a Leave and Remain vote, particularly concerning the sensitive border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He described the subsequent years of Brexit negotiations as a "pretty disastrous period" where political moderates became entrenched purists. Smith, who later helped restore devolution in Stormont, believes that constant constitutional debates distract from crucial issues like public service reform in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly accused Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of mortgage fraud, alleging he intentionally misled lenders about his primary residence to secure favorable loan terms. Trump cited an investigation by Fannie Mae, although a reviewed memorandum from investigators did not explicitly use the term "fraud" but noted a "sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation." Schiff vehemently denied the accusations, dismissing them as a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and a distraction from the ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Schiff maintains transparency about owning two homes—one in Maryland for his children and one in California—and asserts all mortgage arrangements followed legal advice, viewing Trump's claims as a continuation of personal attacks.</p>

Concurrently, European Union foreign ministers failed to approve an 18th package of sanctions against Russia, with Slovakia reportedly obstructing the agreement due to concerns over ending Russian gas imports.
