          <p>Protests in Epping, Essex, concerning the housing of asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel, resulted in three arrests after clashes with police. A dispersal order was in place for the organized march, which saw about 200 people gather. One man was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred, while a man and a woman were arrested for breaching protest orders. The demonstrations followed charges of sexual assault against an asylum seeker housed at the hotel, who has denied the allegations, with the case currently in court.</p>

The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake occurred late Sunday with a shallow depth of 6.2 miles. A smaller, magnitude 4.5 quake followed in the same province shortly after. Afghanistan is situated on a tectonically active region and frequently experiences earthquakes, including a devastating magnitude 6.3 quake in October 2023 that resulted in thousands of casualties.</p>

His spokesperson stated the vehicle was struck from behind at high speed on Saturday night.

          <p>Israel's military has announced that Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, was killed in an airstrike on an apartment building in Gaza City. Israel's Defence Minister congratulated the IDF and Shin Bet for the operation, which was reportedly based on precise intelligence. Hamas has not yet confirmed his death. The strike, which local journalists report also caused civilian casualties, comes as Israel plans a major offensive to seize control of Gaza City, a move that has drawn warnings of catastrophic consequences from the UN.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old woman sought advice from personal finance expert Dave Ramsey after co-signing a $27,000 car loan for her daughter, who subsequently failed to refinance it and accumulated traffic tickets.

Ramsey strongly advised against this, stating that her actions had hurt, not helped, her daughter by placing her in an unaffordable vehicle.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an emergency order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of due process to seek asylum. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan's order, which applies broadly to Guatemalan minors in government custody, required that children be taken off planes that were reportedly preparing for departure. The government contended it was reuniting children with their families, a claim disputed by the children's lawyers.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay announced that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from the side of his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of his post-surgery bandage and stitches on social media, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and rarely spreads, with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to promote safety awareness.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the Trump administration plans to add more resources to immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and has not ruled out expanding them to other cities. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Noem stated that the goal is to target the "worst of the worst" criminals across the country. The planned expansion in Chicago mirrors a recent operation in Los Angeles and is part of a broader federal focus on crime and immigration in cities that limit cooperation with federal agents, known as sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

His first hole-in-one was achieved last December at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's contradictory and improvisational approach to the Russia-Ukraine war has created a confusing stalemate, benefiting Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Trump portrays himself as a peacemaker, his vacillating statements on U.S. involvement and sanctions have undermined a clear strategy, allowing Putin to prolong the conflict through manipulation and attrition. The author suggests that unless Trump commits to a decisive policy to coerce Putin, he risks being seen not as a peacemaker but as a president who enabled Russia's imperial ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Archdiocese of Los Angeles is facing criticism for failing to prevent a developing sports scandal at Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance. The school's football coach was fired after five transfer students were declared ineligible and the team had to forfeit a major game. This situation mirrors a previous scandal at St. Bernard High School involving a coach with a history of violations, suggesting the Archdiocese has not learned from past mistakes. Critics and parents allege that warning signs were ignored as the school rapidly built its football program with transfer students.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the death of an infant from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The baby's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns. This tragic event occurs amid growing concerns over declining vaccine uptake in the UK, with none of the main childhood vaccines reaching the 95% target needed for herd immunity. Health officials are urging pregnant women and parents of young children to ensure their vaccinations are up to date.</p>

While acknowledging there is more work to do, Moore touted the city's progress in reducing crime and criticized the president for offering arrogant criticism instead of constructive federal support, such as increased funding for local law enforcement.</p>

Key ideas discussed included imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian territory in the event of a ceasefire.</p>

For Rangers, the result provided a moment of defensive stability after recent poor performances, earning a point that felt like a minor victory for manager Russell Martin. In contrast, Celtic's attacking play was notably feeble, highlighting manager Brendan Rodgers' urgent need to strengthen his squad before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto announced that political parties have agreed to cut some state-funded perks for politicians in an effort to calm widespread anti-government protests. The nationwide demonstrations were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. The unrest, which has seen clashes with police and property damage, also escalated after the death of a ride-sharing driver during a protest. The president warned that strong action would be taken against looting and violence.</p>

          <p>A massive restoration project off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived a vital kelp forest by removing nearly 5.8 million invasive purple sea urchins. Over the past decade, the urchin population had exploded due to ecological imbalances, creating vast underwater "barrens" by devouring the kelp. Led by The Bay Foundation, an army of divers armed with hammers systematically culled the urchins across 80 acres, allowing the fast-growing kelp to return. The restored ecosystem now provides critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and protects the coastline.</p>
