        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell was reportedly granted a limited form of immunity for a nine-hour, two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Sources indicate this "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell's attorney stated that no promises were made in exchange for her testimony, during which she was questioned about approximately 100 different individuals. Victims have expressed disappointment that the meetings are happening behind closed doors, while President Trump has remained noncommittal about the possibility of clemency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army successfully conducted its first-ever live-fire test of the new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) in Australia, demonstrating enhanced long-range capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. The missile, which has a range of over 300 miles and can hit moving targets, was launched from an Australian-owned HIMARS vehicle. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll stated the test is a key step in deterring regional conflict by providing agile, mobile strike power. This advancement is part of a broader U.S. strategy to bolster its military presence and cooperation with allies amid rising regional tensions.</p>

          <p>An app called Tea, which allows women to review and warn others about men they have dated, has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. The platform, which has over 1.6 million users, offers features like background checks and aims to centralize safety information that women often share in private online groups. While some experts see it as a response to safety features lacking in traditional dating apps, it also raises concerns about potential misinformation. The app recently confirmed it suffered a data breach, exposing user information including selfies and private messages.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans jail, which experienced a major escape of ten inmates in May, has mistakenly released another detainee. Authorities confirmed that 30-year-old Khalil Bryan, held on multiple charges including aggravated assault, was released due to a clerical error involving a shared last name with another inmate. The sheriff's office took full responsibility, calling it "human error" and promising disciplinary action and a full investigation. This incident further intensifies scrutiny on the facility, which is already under a federal consent decree to improve conditions and faces public criticism.</p>

          <p>Despite rising U.S.-China tensions, Chinese students are still seeking higher education in the United States but are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants are now placing greater emphasis on well-known schools, highly-ranked programs, and generous financial aid packages. One student noted that he chose a U.S. university for its academic freedom, despite his family's concerns about instability and his own fears of potential deportation over minor infractions. This trend indicates that while the appeal of an American education remains, students are more carefully weighing the perceived risks and rewards.</p>

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff accused Hamas of not "acting in good faith," while President Trump stated Hamas would be "hunted down." This collapse in diplomacy comes amid a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the World Food Program warning of widespread starvation.

The policy sought to deny automatic citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas.

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's efforts to forge new trade deals, experts warn that a new baseline tariff of 15% will likely lead to higher consumer prices in the U.S. Major companies like Nestlé and General Electric have already indicated they may raise prices to offset the costs of higher import duties. While the White House argues foreign exporters will bear the cost, economists project that categories like apparel and electronics could see significant price hikes. An analysis from the Yale Budget Lab projects the new tariff regime could increase U.S. prices by 2% over two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An executive order from President Trump on homelessness has sparked both outrage and cautious interest from local officials and advocates. The order frames homelessness as a problem of "vagrancy" and "violent attacks," calling for the removal of encampments and encouraging civil commitment for individuals with mental illness. While critics decry the order's punitive tone and push to defund "housing first" and "harm reduction" strategies, some see potential funding opportunities for clearing encampments. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass expressed concern about the approach, emphasizing the need for housing and services.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has announced a new grant program providing over $600 million for state and local governments to detain undocumented migrants. The funding is intended to relieve overcrowding at federal holding facilities as the Trump administration pursues mass deportations. This marks a shift from a previous FEMA program that provided funds for sheltering migrants after their release. The move aligns with the administration's call for states to assist in immigration enforcement, with Florida already operating a large-scale detention facility in the Everglades.</p>

Others in the area acknowledge the economic benefits and jobs the golf course has brought.

The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the higher duties were imposed. The idea of direct payments echoes the stimulus checks issued during the pandemic, but would require new legislation from Congress to be implemented. (not investment advice)</p>
