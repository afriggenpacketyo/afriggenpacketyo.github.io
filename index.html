          <h2>Japan to Release Additional Rice Stockpiles to Curb Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 22:19:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb rising rice prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the move, which will leave the country with a 100,000-ton rice reserve. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, and the government hopes the cheaper rice sold through direct contracts will lower overall prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, a decision hailed as a landmark that will kickstart economic growth and usher in a golden age of clean energy. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, playing a crucial role in the government's plan to eliminate fossil fuels from the energy grid by 2030. However, the project faces opposition, with concerns raised about its cost and potential impact on consumer bills, while critics argue the money could be better spent on other priorities.</p>

          <p>Protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Los Angeles have entered their fourth day, marked by escalated tensions and clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The state of California is suing the Trump administration for deploying the National Guard without consulting Governor Newsom, who called the move illegal. The LAPD has arrested 31 people on charges including failure to disperse, looting, and arson, while California Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department have also made arrests. The protests were spurred by the deployment of National Guard troops to protect federal buildings, leading to demonstrations that blocked freeways and resulted in property damage.</p>

          <p>A research project by four students from a New Mexico high school has brought attention to Unit 731, a secret Japanese military unit that conducted experiments on people in China during World War II. The students' documentary investigates Unit 731 and questions how this history is taught in US schools today. The project highlights not only the atrocities committed by the Japanese unit but also America’s role in keeping its war crimes quiet, prompting a re-evaluation of historical narratives.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, aiming to automate routine tasks and free up time for face-to-face teaching. The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking and that teachers must check its results. Teachers are also permitted to use AI to write routine letters to parents, but transparency and verification of AI-generated content are essential to mitigate risks such as data breaches and errors.</p>
