          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, aiming to increase working-class representation in Whitehall. The initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, will also prioritize successful interns for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it "leftist social engineering," while the government maintains it will help the civil service better reflect the country and harness a broader range of talent.</p>

          <p>Countries around the world are responding to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule, which has resulted in varied outcomes for U.S. trading partners. Nations like Cambodia and Thailand received significant reductions from previously threatened rates, with their leaders expressing relief, while others like Switzerland and Canada face steep duties of 39% and 35% respectively. Taiwan secured a temporary 20% rate pending further negotiations, and major partners like India face a 25% tariff after failing to reach a deal. The reactions highlight the global economic uncertainty and diplomatic maneuvering prompted by the new U.S. trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new tariffs on over 60 U.S. trading partners, set to take effect in seven days. The executive order details rates ranging from 10% to over 40%, determined by a three-tiered system based on whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with the country. While some nations like Japan and the EU secured lower rates through negotiations, Canada faces a steep 35% duty. The White House is justifying the move as a way to rebalance trade, though critics raise concerns about economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>El Salvador's congress, dominated by President Nayib Bukele's Nuevas Ideas party, has approved constitutional reforms that permit indefinite presidential reelection and extend the presidential term from five to six years. The move solidifies Bukele's power, following his controversial 2024 reelection which was enabled by a Supreme Court ruling from judges he appointed. Opposition lawmakers and civil society groups condemned the reforms as the death of democracy and a consolidation of authoritarianism, placing El Salvador alongside Venezuela and Nicaragua in allowing unlimited terms for its leader.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has reported that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, driven by the highly successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company announced that sales for the new device, which launched on June 5, have already reached 5.82 million units. Quarterly revenue hit 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), significantly exceeding analyst expectations and marking a 132% increase year-over-year.

With around nine in ten new cars purchased on finance, a decision against lenders could lead to billions in payouts, similar in scale to the PPI scandal. The outcome is highly anticipated by lenders, consumers, and the government, which has expressed concern over the potential economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major barrage of Russian missiles and drones struck Kyiv, killing at least 28 people, including three children, and wounding 159 others. The attack, which involved over 300 drones and multiple cruise missiles, caused an apartment block to collapse and damaged a children's hospital. This wave of strikes occurred despite a demand from U.S. President Donald Trump for a ceasefire by August 8, signaling that the threat of further sanctions has not deterred Moscow.

The regulatory scrutiny comes as a surprise, as Washington had recently approved the export of these chips to China.

Researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand, who are leading the project, confirmed the method is safe for the animals but will trigger alarms, helping to intercept traffickers.

The policy has led to a volatile global economic environment, with new rates announced for dozens of countries, including a 35% tariff on Canada.

          <p>A Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was forced to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence, resulting in 25 people being hospitalized. Passengers described a terrifying experience where the plane shook violently and dropped suddenly, sending people and objects flying through the cabin. The injuries reported included broken ribs and whiplash. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, which experts suggest may be part of a trend of increasing clear-air turbulence linked to climate change, making air travel bumpier in the future.</p>

          <p>Dustin Ronald Alba, a 31-year-old from Oxnard, has been sentenced to 111 years to life in prison for the sexual assault of five women between 2012 and 2020. Alba used dating apps and social media to meet his victims, who reported that he would use his body weight to confine them before assaulting them. The case was initiated after a victim reported an assault in 2020, leading investigators to uncover four other victims through text messages on Alba's phone. Prosecutors highlighted that he abused a position of trust and preyed on vulnerable individuals.</p>

He argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass a gridlocked Congress, more legal challenges that require urgent court intervention are inevitable. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh acknowledged criticism but stated the court has increased its process, including scheduling oral arguments for these cases. He expressed strong collegiality among the justices, stating that despite disagreements, they are all patriots operating in good faith on difficult issues.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the CISA director in the Biden administration, had her appointment to a distinguished chair position at West Point rescinded by the Secretary of the Army. The reversal came after pro-Trump activist Laura Loomer highlighted the hiring on social media, accusing Easterly of being a holdover who would undermine the Trump administration. Easterly, a West Point graduate with a long military career, called the decision a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The incident follows a similar pattern where activist pressure has led to the dismissal of other government officials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling extends their legal status and protection from deportation while the case proceeds, with the judge citing the administration's failure to conduct an objective review of country conditions. In a sharply worded order, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the decision was motivated by racial animus. The ruling provides a temporary reprieve for thousands who have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's claim of countries like Australia "freeloading" on U.S. medical research is a misguided attempt to deflect from America's own healthcare system failures. The author points out that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse outcomes, a problem rooted in its own policies. The article suggests that instead of blaming allies, the U.S. could learn from systems like Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) to control drug prices. It concludes that Australia should treat the U.S. as a tough trading partner, not a benevolent ally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her first post-election interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is currently "broken." She explained her decision not to run for California governor was a desire to step away from the system for now, as she feels it is not strong enough to defend fundamental principles. Harris clarified she is not giving up the fight but wants to engage with Americans outside of a transactional, political context. The interview was a major exclusive for Colbert, whose show "The Late Show" is slated to end after its next season.</p>
