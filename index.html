          <p>India's foreign ministry has responded to threats of increased tariffs from the U.S., asserting that its oil trade with Russia is a matter of national necessity. The ministry highlighted that it only began significant Russian oil imports after traditional European supplies were diverted following the 2022 Ukraine conflict, a move it claims the U.S. initially encouraged to stabilize global energy markets. New Delhi pointed out the hypocrisy of the criticism, noting that both the U.S. and E.U. continue their own, non-essential trade with Russia. India maintains its actions are justified to ensure affordable energy for its citizens and will protect its national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British energy company BP has announced second-quarter profits that surpassed analyst expectations, reporting an underlying profit of $2.35 billion. The strong performance is attributed to high operating efficiency and the launch of five new major projects. CEO Murray Auchincloss also highlighted significant exploration success, including the recent Bumerangue discovery off the coast of Brazil, the company's largest find in 25 years. These positive results come as BP aims to restore investor confidence after a period of underperformance compared to its industry competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a decrease in second-quarter revenue, attributing the drop to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. The state-owned oil giant posted an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, slightly beating analyst forecasts. CEO Amin Nasser expressed confidence in the market's future, projecting that oil demand will increase by over two million barrels per day in the latter half of 2025. The company's income is expected to be bolstered by increased production as OPEC+ partners unwind voluntary output cuts later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick opens up about navigating the most significant slump of his professional golf career and his deep-seated love for football. After parting with his longtime caddie and coach, Fitzpatrick began working with a new coach, Mark Blackburn, which helped him identify and correct technical issues in his swing. This change has led to a resurgence in form, highlighted by a career-best fourth-place finish at The Open. Fitzpatrick credits his family for their support and reveals a strong interest in football analytics, even expressing a desire to work in the sport one day.</p>

Despite legal challenges and concerns from his attorneys that the device could cause unnecessary pain during the lethal injection, Governor Bill Lee has denied a reprieve. The state has argued that Black would not feel any potential shocks from the device, a claim his lawyers contest. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend, Angela Clay, and her two young daughters.</p>

          <p>As England prepares for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia, the team's success appears to be intrinsically linked to the performance and fitness of captain Ben Stokes. England has not won a Test series in Australia since 2010-11, and the current squad has little to no experience of winning there. This article suggests that while England's batting lineup looks strong, its chances hinge on Stokes' ability to recover from injury and lead from the front, both as a player and a captain. An England victory would be a monumental achievement, overcoming a historically dominant Australian side on their home turf.</p>

The order is part of an ongoing trial where Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup plot to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. The decision follows Bolsonaro addressing supporters via his son's phone during a protest, which the court deemed a "flagrant disrespect" of his legal restrictions.

          <p>The Gifford fire, a massive wildfire in central California's Los Padres National Forest, has burned over 72,000 acres and is threatening more than 450 structures. The blaze, which is only 5% contained, has prompted evacuation orders in coastal Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames in extremely difficult terrain, with their efforts hampered by smoke and erratic winds. The fire's growth is expected to be fueled by a forecast of hotter and drier weather, increasing the risk to nearby communities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the investigation into Russian interference and the 2016 Trump campaign. This move follows a referral from the Director of National Intelligence and aligns with Donald Trump's long-standing claims of a politically motivated "witch hunt." It is currently unclear what specific charges are being considered or who might be targeted. The action re-ignites the highly partisan debate over the FBI's initial probe, which a 2023 special counsel report found had lacked "analytical rigor."</p>

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated, with Governor Greg Abbott ordering the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional map. The Democrats' departure broke the legislative quorum, preventing the House from conducting business. In response, the Republican House Speaker issued warrants to compel the members' return, a move supported by the governor. The Democratic lawmakers, who traveled to Illinois and New York, argue they are protecting voting rights from a partisan gerrymandering plan, calling the threat of arrest an authoritarian tactic.</p>

          <p>Glass House Brands, a major California cannabis company, has announced a significant overhaul of its labor practices after a large-scale immigration raid on its facilities last month.

The company has terminated its relationship with the farm labor contractors involved and is hiring experts, including a firm led by a former ICE director, to improve its employment verification processes. Glass House stated it is taking these steps, which are above legal requirements, to ensure such a situation never happens again.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan in a landmark defense deal valued at approximately $6.5 billion. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations. The deal, which saw Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries win the contract, is a key part of Australia's military restructuring to counter China's regional influence. The first three warships will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia, marking a significant step in tightening the strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties over allegations of improper hazardous waste disposal. The lawsuit claimed that the shipping giant had illegally disposed of corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. According to the Riverside County District Attorney's office, UPS was cooperative during the investigation. The company has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the United States is straining emergency services and could force more communities to switch to paid departments, a move that would increase costs for taxpayers. According to the National Volunteer Fire Council, the number of volunteers has dropped by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled. Volunteer firehouses, which comprise nearly 70% of all fire departments, save taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to help recruit younger volunteers and address the critical shortage.</p>

The campaign had previously drawn criticism online from some who accused it of promoting eugenics, a claim the company denied.

However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing.
