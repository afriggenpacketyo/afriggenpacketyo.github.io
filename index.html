          <p>Record-breaking flash floods in Ruidoso, New Mexico, have resulted in the deaths of three people, including a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. The flooding was caused by heavy monsoonal rains falling on burn scars from previous wildfires, causing the Rio Ruidoso to crest at a historic 20 feet. Officials reported that over 65 people were rescued from trees and homes, with emergency crews and the National Guard having been pre-deployed. A flood watch remains in effect for the region, and a federal disaster assistance request has been issued.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California's Department of Education, alleging that its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete based on gender identity violate federal civil rights laws. The Justice Department claims these rules unlawfully discriminate against female athletes and create a hostile educational environment under the Equal Protection Clause. This legal action follows threats of fines and an administrative demand that the state reverse its policies, which California officials have so far refused to do. The conflict escalated after a transgender athlete won two state high school track-and-field events, prompting new state-level rules for such competitions.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to his Aberdeenshire golf resort later this month. The visit is expected for the opening of a new course, though it will not include a private meeting with King Charles. This would be Trump's first visit to Scotland since his election, with his 2018 presidential trip prompting major security operations and widespread protests. Critics have raised concerns about the potential policing costs, while the Scottish government stated it is coordinating with UK authorities to support the operation.</p>

          <p>Linda Yaccarino has stepped down as CEO of the social media platform X after a turbulent two years in the role, a move announced shortly after the company's AI chatbot engaged in an antisemitic tirade. Hired by Elon Musk to stabilize the company and restore advertiser confidence, Yaccarino faced numerous challenges, including defending Musk's controversial statements and navigating drastic changes at the platform formerly known as Twitter. While she did not state a reason for her departure, her tenure was marked by her efforts to bridge the gap between Musk's vision and the demands of major brands.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in south-central Texas have led to at least 119 deaths statewide, with Kerr County being the most severely affected area. Officials confirmed at least 95 fatalities in the county, including 36 children, and more than 150 people remain missing. The disaster occurred when the Guadalupe River swelled rapidly, inundating homes and a summer camp. Extensive search and rescue missions are ongoing, with emergency responders using heavy equipment to clear debris. Questions are being raised about the adequacy of flood warnings, though Governor Greg Abbott stated the magnitude of the storm was not anticipated.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores a mother's anxiety over the potential impact of the Trump administration's policies on her 7-year-old daughter, who has a rare chromosomal anomaly. The author details her reliance on a network of special-education teachers and therapists funded through public programs, which she calls her daughter's "many mothers." She expresses deep concern that proposed cuts to the Department of Education and Medicaid could dismantle this crucial support system, which enables millions of students with disabilities to receive an education. The article argues against valuing efficiency over the human-centered work of building an inclusive and accommodating society for the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will issue administrative subpoenas to Harvard University to obtain information on its foreign students, escalating a conflict with the institution. This action follows an earlier demand for records related to alleged "illegal and violent" activities, which Harvard claimed it complied with but the administration deemed insufficient. In a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the university of allowing students to abuse visas and advocate for terrorism. The move is part of a broader pressure campaign against Harvard, which includes threats to its accreditation and the freezing of federal grants.</p>

          <p>With federal student loan payments resuming and a new law set to overhaul repayment programs, borrowers are facing a new financial landscape. This article outlines five strategies to make payments more affordable before stricter rules take effect. Recommendations include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan to cap monthly bills, requesting temporary deferment or forbearance for short-term hardship, and setting up autopay for an interest rate discount. It also suggests exploring employer or state-based repayment assistance programs and cautiously considering refinancing private loans to secure a lower interest rate, while weighing the loss of federal protections.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump is set to make significant changes to the federal student loan system, which experts warn could make higher education more expensive and less accessible. The legislation consolidates repayment plans, eliminating options like the SAVE plan and replacing them with a new income-driven plan that could result in higher monthly payments for lower-income borrowers. It also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees, which may not be sufficient to cover the full cost of programs like medical school, potentially worsening professional shortages.

          <p>The United States has recorded its most severe measles outbreak since 1992, with 1,288 cases confirmed so far this year, a significant increase from last year. The spread is attributed to declining childhood vaccination rates, creating a risk for new outbreaks as summer camps and travel increase opportunities for transmission. Health officials are urging vigilance, as measles is a highly contagious and dangerous virus that can lead to severe complications, including pneumonia and death. Experts emphasize that the two-dose MMR vaccine is the most effective protection, but a more lax approach to vaccination from the current administration raises public health concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its aggressive trade policy, announcing it will impose new tariffs on at least 20 countries by August 1, with rates ranging from 20% to 40%. In letters posted on social media, President Trump informed leaders of nations like Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines of the impending duties, stating they are necessary to correct trade imbalances. This move ends a 90-day freeze on such tariffs and is expected to significantly raise the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports. Economists warn that these wide-ranging tariffs could fuel inflation and disrupt global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its popular Snack Wrap and introducing a limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin as part of a strategy to boost sales amid a slowdown from inflation-weary customers. The fast-food giant saw its U.S. same-store sales decline in the first quarter, with traffic from low-income consumers dropping significantly. The menu refresh, which also includes an emphasis on its McValue deals, aims to regain customer trust and stay competitive. The return of the Snack Wrap, a fan-favorite discontinued in 2016, is a strategic move to leverage nostalgia and existing customer demand.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified efforts to influence monetary policy, including his reported consideration of naming a "shadow chair" to pressure the Federal Reserve, are raising concerns about the central bank's independence. Analysts suggest that any successor to current Chair Jerome Powell could be perceived as being appointed solely to implement Trump's demands for lower interest rates, undermining their credibility. This approach, which links rate cuts to reducing government debt-servicing costs rather than the Fed's dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment, could create uncertainty in financial markets and pose institutional risks for the Fed.

          <p>Colorado State University researchers are predicting an above-average Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, with an updated forecast estimating 16 named storms, eight hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. The predicted activity is about 125% higher than the long-term average, driven primarily by warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures. While this forecast is slightly less intense than the one for the 2024 season, it still signals a significant threat to coastal regions. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which will be a key factor in determining the season's ultimate severity.</p>

          <p>A recently released CIA report, ordered by Director John Ratcliffe to review the 2016 intelligence assessment on Russian election interference, does not support his public claims that the original findings were politically manipulated. While the new report critiques the process of the 2016 assessment, such as its short timeline, it does not refute the core conclusion that Russia interfered to help Donald Trump. Critics, including former intelligence leaders, argue that the release of this internal review is itself a political act intended to bolster the "Russia Hoax" narrative, especially as it omits contradictory findings from other inquiries like the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.</p>

Speaking at a news conference, Rollins pointed to "34 million able-bodied adults" on Medicaid as a potential labor source, following new legislation mandating work requirements for the program. However, agricultural experts and economists have long warned that such measures are not viable substitutes for the immigrant workforce that underpins U.S. agriculture.

Analysts say potential candidates range from hardliners like Khamenei's son to past reformist presidents, though the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may favor a non-clerical leader. The choice will determine Iran's future direction, particularly its stance toward the West, after a period of significant economic and military setbacks.</p>
