          <p>Following a significant glacier collapse in Switzerland's LÃ¶tschental valley, authorities reported a stabilization of the situation.  Initial concerns about flooding from the Lonza River, which had been dammed by debris, subsided as the river found new paths.  While the immediate danger lessened, officials warn that continued melting and forecast rain could increase risks of further landslides. The village of Blatten, buried by the collapse, is slated for reconstruction.</p>
