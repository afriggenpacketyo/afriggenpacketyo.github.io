          <p>Former President Donald Trump has called for an immediate ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand following an escalation in border clashes that have resulted in numerous casualties. He stated on social media that he spoke with the leaders of both nations, who are reportedly open to peace talks and de-escalation. Trump indicated that the U.S. would not resume trade negotiations with either country until the fighting ceases completely. The statement comes as the U.N.

          <p>Grocery store workers for Stater Bros. Markets in Southern California have voted to authorize a strike, affecting approximately 12,000 employees across the region. The United Food and Commercial Workers union claims the company has engaged in unlawful union-busting tactics, including surveillance and discrimination against its members. While the vote authorizes a strike, it does not guarantee one will occur, as bargaining negotiations are scheduled for the end of July. The union plans to hold public engagement events to rally support, citing the company's recent layoffs and expired labor contract as key issues.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition lawmakers have successfully survived a recall campaign, allowing them to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature and prolonging the island's political gridlock. The recall effort targeted 24 opposition members accused of undermining national security and being overly friendly toward China. Since winning a parliamentary majority in early 2024, the opposition has consistently blocked the agenda of President William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party. The failure of the recall vote means President Lai will likely face an emboldened and uncooperative parliament for the remainder of his term, complicating governance amid rising tensions with Beijing.</p>

Lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective declassification of related files.

          <p>Donald Trump's extensive use of tariffs and recently negotiated trade deals are facing significant legal challenges that could dismantle his economic policies. A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments in a case questioning his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which underpins many of his trade actions. A lower court has already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision is on hold pending the appeal. Experts suggest that if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against him, it could invalidate numerous trade agreements and tariffs implemented during his term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>USAID Analysis Finds No Evidence of Widespread Hamas Aid Diversion in Gaza</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:29:19 EDT</div>

          <p>An internal analysis by USAID officials reportedly found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The report, which examined over 150 incidents of aid loss between October 2023 and May 2024, appears to contradict claims by the Trump administration and Israel used to justify restricting aid through traditional U.N. channels. The findings indicate that in most cases, the perpetrators of aid theft could not be identified. The State Department has forcefully pushed back against the analysis, asserting that available intelligence and video evidence confirm significant looting of aid by Hamas.</p>

          <p>A humanitarian aid distribution in Gaza, designated as a "women only" day to ensure safer access to food, ended in tragedy with the deaths of at least two women. Witnesses reported that the scene descended into chaos, with Israeli troops and security contractors using pepper spray and stun grenades on the crowd before opening fire. One of the victims, Mary Sheikh al-Eid, was a widowed mother of seven who was shot in the head. The incident highlights the extreme danger civilians face while trying to obtain essential supplies, even when special measures are supposedly in place to protect them.</p>

The officers were reportedly working on two military-style grenades when one of them detonated. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is investigating the blast and an extensive search for the second device has so far been unsuccessful. The sheriff has ordered an independent review of the department's explosives handling policies and mandated that all such devices, inert or not, be treated as live in the future.</p>

A strong police presence of about 60 officers was on hand to manage the event and prevent escalation.

          <p>Australian rugby coach Joe Schmidt has criticized the referee's decision not to penalize a clearout by Jac Morgan in the final moments of their 29-26 loss to the British and Irish Lions. The play immediately preceded the match-winning try by Hugo Keenan, which secured the series for the tourists. Schmidt argued the clearout was dangerous and went against the sport's push for player safety, but the Television Match Official upheld the on-field decision. The controversial ending denied Australia a chance to force a series decider, compounding the team's painful defeat in a tightly contested match.</p>

          <p>A new advertising campaign for American Eagle featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has coincided with a notable rise in the company's stock price. The ads, which embrace a traditionally alluring aesthetic, are being viewed as a departure from the message-driven marketing common today. Investors appear to be betting that this more direct, product-focused approach will drive a significant increase in sales. The article suggests this move could signal a broader shift on Wall Street back toward prioritizing profit through proven advertising strategies over conforming to politically motivated trends.
