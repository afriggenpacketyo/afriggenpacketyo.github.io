          <p>Voters in South Texas, largely SpaceX employees, approved the incorporation of Starbase as an official city, fulfilling Elon Musk's vision for the area. The new city, located near the Mexico border, will manage its own roads, utilities, and potentially schooling and medical care. Critics worry about Musk's increased control, including the potential to close a popular beach and state park for launch operations, as SpaceX seeks to increase launch frequency. The South Texas Environmental Justice Network continues to protest the city vote and beach access issues.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Liberty International Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing problems, leading to significant delays and cancellations. The FAA attributes the issues to equipment malfunctions, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia's air traffic control center, which oversees Newark's airspace. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has announced plans to revamp the air traffic control system to address these issues, but travelers continue to face disruptions. Passengers express frustration over the ongoing delays, which have rippled through other major airports.</p>

Conflicting reports from Russian and Ukrainian sources make it difficult to assess the true situation on the ground, with many locals blaming Putin for starting the war.

          <p>The death of Kendy Howard, found in her bathtub with a gunshot wound, is being investigated as a possible staged suicide by her husband, Dan Howard, a former state trooper.

Kendy was planning to divorce Dan and had a history of marital problems, including an affair and allegations of abuse.
