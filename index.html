          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will impose an extra 10% tariff on countries aligning with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The threat, issued via Truth Social, came as the bloc met in Brazil and criticized his protectionist measures as being inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules. BRICS leaders warned that such unilateral actions disrupt the global economy and worsen existing disparities. The Trump administration also affirmed it would begin sending letters detailing country-specific tariff rates, creating further uncertainty for global trade partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has found Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The 50-year-old now faces a potential life sentence for the 2023 incident, which also resulted in the attempted murder of a fourth relative who survived. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally poisoned the beef Wellington dish, while the defense claimed it was an accident and that she lied to investigators out of panic. The nine-week trial captivated the public with its dramatic testimony and complex evidence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." Trump called the move "ridiculous" and a source of "disruption and chaos," stating he was saddened to see Musk go "off the rails." The announcement marks a significant falling out between the former allies, which soured over disagreements on a recent tax and spending bill. Musk's move was also met with criticism from some of Trump's allies in the business community.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, but it continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas and Virginia. The system is expected to drop up to six inches of rain in some areas, prompting flood watches and warnings. In Chatham County, North Carolina, the Haw River surged dramatically, approaching a record crest and causing a highway to collapse. While the storm is weakening as it moves northeast, forecasters warn of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Atlantic coast.</p>

          <p>A review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded there is no evidence of a "client list" of associates that Jeffrey Epstein may have used for blackmail. The memo, reviewed by ABC News, also confirms that Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019, contradicting widespread conspiracy theories. According to the review, investigators did not find evidence to support charges against any uncharged third parties related to Epstein's crimes. The findings are likely to generate controversy among those who believe Epstein's powerful associates were involved in his sex trafficking ring.</p>

          <p>Across Europe, the increasing financialization of housing is driving up prices, fueling a crisis that experts warn is a political timebomb. Since 2008, institutional investors like private equity firms have poured trillions into residential real estate, treating homes as a lucrative asset class and pushing ownership out of reach for many. This trend has exacerbated inequality, increased homelessness, and contributed to the rise of far-right political movements. Critics argue that while investors frame themselves as a solution to housing shortages, their profit-driven model actually relies on scarcity to maintain high returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his public feud with President Trump, Elon Musk's vow to create a new "America Party" confronts significant legal and logistical obstacles. Election law experts note that establishing a new national party is a complex, expensive, and multi-year process, requiring navigation of 50 different state laws designed to favor the two-party system. Gaining ballot access involves collecting vast numbers of signatures and would likely face intense legal challenges from both the Republican and Democratic parties. While Musk has financial resources, structural barriers make creating a viable third party a daunting task.</p>

          <p>Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an affiliate of al-Qaeda, has become a dominant force behind the surge of jihadist violence across West Africa's Sahel region. Formed in 2017, the group has expanded its operations from Mali into Burkina Faso and Niger, exploiting local grievances and weak governance to recruit thousands of fighters. JNIM seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law and has dramatically increased the frequency and scale of its attacks, claiming to have killed nearly 1,000 people since April. Counterinsurgency efforts by local and international forces have so far failed to contain the growing threat.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is calling for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence. In a statement from their summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders described AI as a unique opportunity for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair governance. They stressed the need for international protocols to ensure trust, security, and reliability in AI systems. The bloc also called for equal access to AI technologies for developing nations and safeguards for intellectual property that do not hinder technology transfer.</p>

          <p>Survivors from Camp Mystic are recounting the terrifying moments when a flash flood devastated the Christian girls' camp in Texas. The Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in about 45 minutes, inundating low-lying cabins where many girls were sleeping. Thirteen-year-old Stella Thompson described hysterical and terrified prayers as she and others on higher ground realized what was happening, later witnessing first responders pulling girls from the water. The camp's director was among the dead, and the disaster has raised questions about the safety of locating camps so close to the river.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year. Containment of the blaze, which has burned over 80,000 acres, increased to 30% thanks to favorable weather and an influx of personnel. The fire, which started near the border of Santa Barbara County, threatens the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to several endangered species. While over 200 people are under evacuation orders, officials are hopeful they can continue to gain control before a projected midweek heat wave.</p>

The talks, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, are focused on a U.S.-led proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release. However, significant gaps remain, with Hamas demanding a permanent end to the war, a condition Israel's government has repeatedly rejected.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people necessary time away from work to grieve. The change, which has been championed by campaigners and MPs, is being welcomed by support organizations as a hugely important step in acknowledging the significant impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>The UK government will offer early years teachers in England tax-free payments of £4,500 to work in nurseries located in disadvantaged areas. The incentive is part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at boosting educational standards and narrowing the attainment gap among preschool children. The plan seeks to attract and retain qualified staff in 20 designated areas where support is most needed. The education department noted that currently only one in ten nurseries employs a specialist early years teacher, a gap this new policy aims to address.</p>
