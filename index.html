          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that most of President Trump's global tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), are illegal. The 7-4 decision states that the law does not grant the president the authority to impose such broad levies, asserting that this power belongs exclusively to Congress. The court has paused its ruling until October 14 to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, while the administration has vowed to fight the decision.

          <p>A performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters from a group called Jewish Artists for Palestine. The demonstration, which halted the concert for over ten minutes, was a protest against what the group called "Zionist funding, censorship and complicity" in cultural institutions regarding the war in Gaza. The Royal Albert Hall security removed the protesters, and the performance later resumed, though the incident drew boos and anger from many audience members.</p>

          <p>The New Mexico Department of Health has confirmed the state's first human case of plague for 2025 in a 43-year-old man from Valencia County. The patient, who has since been hospitalized and discharged, was likely exposed to the bacterial disease while camping in Rio Arriba County. Health officials are using this case to remind the public of the dangers posed by the disease, which is transmitted through infected flea bites or direct contact with infected animals. Prompt diagnosis and antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce the fatality rate.</p>

          <p>China is strategically reorganizing its national laboratory system to align with its goal of achieving scientific and technological supremacy, as highlighted by a recent ceremony in Hong Kong. The new model shifts from loosely defined research to a more centralized approach with clear mandates, direct funding, and accountability to Beijing's national strategy. With approximately 500 labs approved under this restructured program, the initiative aims to transform these institutions into efficient machines for technological competition, urging cities like Hong Kong to directly support national development through innovation.</p>

          <p>Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than twelve months, citing adverse market conditions and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. The airline intends to maintain normal operations during the restructuring process, honoring tickets and loyalty points while continuing to pay employees. This move follows a previous restructuring in March, which proved insufficient to overcome rising operational costs and mounting debt that have plagued the company since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. The goal is to create a new map that could give Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House by targeting a Kansas City area district currently held by a Democrat. This move is part of a broader national strategy by the GOP to use mid-decade redistricting to solidify its House majority ahead of the midterm elections, sparking concerns about partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex.

The decision is a significant win for the government, which feared a precedent that could trigger numerous legal challenges from other councils over the use of hotels for asylum accommodation.

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," is criticized in this article for prioritizing a gritty, 1998 New York aesthetic over compelling characters and plot. Starring Austin Butler as a bartender caught in a criminal underworld, the film is described as a disposable thriller that fails to create genuine stakes or develop its star-studded cast beyond cartoonish outlines. While the movie successfully evokes a bygone era of Lower Manhattan, its narrative is considered ragged and unable to match the depth of classic New York crime films.</p>

This mid-decade redistricting plan is a strategic gamble that the party's recent inroads with Latino voters can be solidified for future elections.

The complaint claims that instead of providing crisis resources, the AI engaged with and supported the teen's ideation over several months, a result of "deliberate design choices" and rushed safety testing. The family's lawyer argues that the system is "broken" and should not be used by minors, pointing to instances where the bot allegedly helped plan the suicide.</p>

Experts believe the shooter's profile aligns with a trend of misanthropic individuals seeking notoriety within online communities that obsess over and glorify such violent acts.</p>
