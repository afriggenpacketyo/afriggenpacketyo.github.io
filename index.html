          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Nvidia CEO's Criticism of China AI Chip Export Controls Misses the Mark</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips are a "failure" that spurred Chinese innovation. The author argues that China's efforts to achieve tech independence predate the 2022 restrictions and are driven by national security concerns. The controls aim to prevent advanced chips from fueling the modernization of the People's Liberation Army. Despite Huang's warnings, Nvidia's success has continued, with data center revenue jumping significantly, and the real risk lies in disrupting the policies' momentum. The author argues that U.S. semiconductor policy is about protecting America's strategic edge, not Nvidia's market share in China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has seemingly backtracked on its decision to revoke Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, granting the school 30 days to demonstrate compliance. This action follows Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's previous announcement citing Harvard's failure to provide requested information and its alleged hostile environment towards Jewish students. Harvard has filed a lawsuit arguing that the revocation is retaliation for exercising its First Amendment rights and challenges the administration's attempt to freeze billions in grants and contracts. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration from revoking the certification, stating that international students would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the policy were enacted.</p>

          <p>Israeli ministers have announced the approval of 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, marking the largest expansion in decades. Some of these settlements already exist as unauthorized outposts, while others are entirely new, according to Israeli officials. This move has drawn criticism internationally, with settlements widely considered illegal under international law, a view disputed by Israel. Palestinian officials have condemned the expansion as a "dangerous escalation," while an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog called it the most extensive move of its kind in over 30 years, warning it will dramatically reshape the West Bank.</p>

This development indicates a positive shift in trade relations and is expected to boost Boeing's production. Boeing has been paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes, but the company anticipates recouping much of these costs upon exporting the finished aircraft.

          <p>The United States and China are engaging in supply chain warfare, threatening their recent tariff truce by using export controls on critical components. China has restricted exports of rare earth magnets, essential for various industries, while the U.S. has banned semiconductors from Huawei and suspended shipments of American semiconductors and aerospace equipment for China's C919 aircraft. These actions are disrupting the flow of key components, potentially impacting industries in both countries. Experts suggest that if China maintains export controls on rare earths, multinational companies may seek to diversify their supply chains to reduce reliance on China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's global tariff policy is facing legal challenges, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the administration will work to "aggressively revoke visas" for Chinese students at U.S. universities. This action is part of the administration's ongoing dispute with Harvard and reflects a broader crackdown on student visas. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the court ruling on tariffs, arguing it will cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario."</p>

          <p>Financial experts are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) this June, considering factors like the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies and the current economic environment. While long-term CDs typically offer higher APYs, short-term CDs are currently providing the most competitive interest rates. A CD ladder strategy, involving investments in CDs with varying maturity dates, is recommended to maximize returns and manage liquidity. Experts advise individuals to consider their financial goals, emergency funds, and potential need for funds before the CD term ends when making a decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on processing certain immigration applications, stating that it is not in the public interest for immigrants to lose their legal status. The ruling benefits immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, and Ukraine, among others, who were admitted under Biden administration parole programs. The judge found the administration's actions to be arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law. The Department of Homeland Security has criticized the ruling.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with a Utah railway project intended to transport crude oil, limiting the scope of environmental impact reviews required for federal agencies. The 8-0 ruling overturned a lower court decision that had halted the project, stating that agencies need only consider the environmental effects of the project at hand, not potential future or geographically separate projects. Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a procedural cross-check, not a substantive roadblock. The ruling has been closely watched by companies and environmental groups.</p>

          <p>An article argues that the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to strike down President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law, not a judicial overreach. The author asserts that the Constitution delegates tariff power to Congress, not the president, and the court merely affirmed Congress's power. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include states acting as a check on unlawful exercises of federal power. Congress created the Court of International Trade to exercise authority over trade disputes.</p>
