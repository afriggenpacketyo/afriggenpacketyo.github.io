Factors such as supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty all play a significant role in determining its value. The article notes that gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset, particularly during times of financial instability, which drives investor interest and reinforces its historical standing in the market.

          <p>An analyst from a government-sponsored think tank suggests China might pursue land reclamation at the Scarborough Shoal to strengthen its sovereignty claims. The decision would reportedly hinge on factors of control, cost, and potential confrontation. This move would also serve to limit the presence of Philippine vessels and reduce the expense of maintaining a constant law enforcement presence in the disputed South China Sea waters, escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official has confirmed that the preliminary deal to maintain TikTok's U.S. operations will not include an equity stake or a "golden share" for the federal government. The agreement involves relocating the app's U.S. base into a new joint venture with a majority-American board of directors. Tech company Oracle is set to oversee the platform's security operations, ensuring data privacy and management within the United States as part of the new structure.</p>

          <p>A review of the new Tesla Diner in Los Angeles critiques it as a superficially futuristic but functionally mundane establishment that fails to reinvent the dining experience. The restaurant, intended as an amenity for Tesla owners charging their vehicles, features a retro-futuristic design but offers a limited, uninspired menu and suffers from design flaws. The author argues that the diner embodies a conservative, nostalgia-driven vision, representing the past's idea of the future rather than genuine innovation.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed as a patron of the Julia's House children's charity following the emergence of an email in which she referred to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The 2011 email appeared to contradict her public denunciation of him, though a spokesperson claimed it was sent to defuse a legal threat from Epstein. Another charity, the Teenage Cancer Trust, is also reviewing its relationship with the duchess in light of the revelation.</p>
