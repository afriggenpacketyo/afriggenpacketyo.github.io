          <p>A gunman shot and killed two women, aged 72 and 32, at the Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. The incident occurred after the suspect first shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop near the Blue Grass Airport. After fleeing the initial scene and carjacking a vehicle, the suspect opened fire at the church, also injuring two men before being killed by police. Authorities believe the shooter, whose identity has not been released, may have had a connection to the victims at the church.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security service, the SBU, announced it has tracked down and killed the Russian agents suspected of assassinating a senior SBU colonel in Kyiv. The colonel, Ivan Voronych, was killed in a daylight attack, and the SBU stated the suspects were eliminated when they resisted arrest. The report notes that Voronych was allegedly involved in covert operations within Russia-occupied territories. This event highlights the ongoing shadow war of assassinations and counter-operations between Ukrainian and Russian intelligence services since the full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>A couple who paid $400,000 in cash for a home in the Austin, Texas, area a year ago now say they "hate it here" and are prepared to sell, even if it means losing an estimated $40,000. Their story, shared on Reddit, prompted numerous responses from others who have experienced buyer's remorse, with many advising them to prioritize their happiness over the financial loss. The situation highlights the potential pitfalls of moving to a new city without prior experience, leading many to recommend renting first before making a significant home purchase.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 in a London hospital after a period of illness. A polarizing figure, he first led the country in the 1980s after a coup, launching a repressive anti-corruption campaign. He later returned to power as a "converted democrat" in a historic 2015 election, but his presidency from 2015 to 2023 was marked by economic decline and widespread insecurity. Despite a fraught legacy, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill designed to give President Trump a "sledgehammer" against Russia's economy. The legislation would allow the president to impose massive tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's war effort by purchasing its goods. This legislative push comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the war in Ukraine. The bill aims to provide maximum flexibility to pressure Russia and its allies to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump reveals the Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled at least ten requests from his security detail for additional resources during the 2024 campaign.

The report accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. It concludes that a pattern of negligence and communication failures contributed to the preventable tragedy in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p>

At a recent conservative conference, he engaged in a heated exchange with a heckler, challenging the protester's courage. Homan also spent time clarifying previous remarks that were widely interpreted as an admission of racial profiling by ICE agents, stating that physical appearance cannot be the sole factor for detaining someone. In the same interview, he acknowledged that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests."</p>
