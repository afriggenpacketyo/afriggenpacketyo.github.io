          <p>A federal judge has dismissed an antitrust lawsuit filed by Newsmax against Fox News, citing it as an impermissible "shotgun complaint" that improperly bundled allegations. Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling, however, is not a final defeat for Newsmax, as she has granted the company a short window to submit an amended, correctly structured complaint. The lawsuit accuses Fox News of monopolistic practices aimed at suppressing conservative media competitors through intimidation and other anti-competitive tactics. Fox News has dismissed the allegations as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own failures in the marketplace.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the parent company of Tylenol, dropped over 10% following a report that the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., plans to release findings potentially linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism. This move aligns with Kennedy's history of questioning established medical science and vaccine policies. Kenvue issued a statement reaffirming its belief that no causal link exists, citing agreement from the FDA and other medical organizations on the safety of acetaminophen when used as directed. The development has created significant market uncertainty for the major consumer health company. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling significantly short of expectations and signaling a cooling labor market, while the unemployment rate increased to 4.3%. The report also included major downward revisions, revealing that the economy lost jobs in June for the first time since 2020. This combination of slowing job growth, rising unemployment for Black Americans, and persistent inflation from trade tariffs presents a complex challenge for the economy. The weak data strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that spending a limited amount of time on personal online browsing during work does not constitute a fireable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an administrator who was dismissed after her employer used spyware to track her activity on shopping and property websites. The ruling highlighted that the employee's personal usage was not excessive and that the company lacked a clear policy prohibiting it. The judge concluded the dismissal was unfairly motivated by the owner's desire to remove the employee before she accrued additional legal protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump is escalating threats to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, citing public safety concerns despite data showing crime is down. The move faces strong opposition from Democratic governors and mayors, who argue it is an illegal and politically motivated power play, especially after a federal judge ruled a similar deployment in Los Angeles was unlawful. While Louisiana's Republican governor has welcomed the idea, officials in Illinois and Maryland are preparing for legal challenges.

          <p>Lululemon's shares fell 20% after the company significantly lowered its full-year earnings forecast, projecting a $240 million negative impact from U.S. tariffs. While second-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, revenue fell slightly short, and the company's guidance for the upcoming quarter and full fiscal year was well below Wall Street expectations. CEO Calvin McDonald admitted that the brand's product offerings, particularly in casual wear, have become stale and predictable, contributing to a slowdown in U.S. sales. The company plans a product reset to regain momentum amid the challenging economic and trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four-time Super Bowl champion Rob Gronkowski believes that rookie quarterbacks are entering the NFL more prepared than ever before. He attributes this readiness to the advanced knowledge and coaching they receive at the college level, which allows them to quickly adapt to professional playbooks. Gronkowski noted that this is a significant shift from a decade ago, when young quarterbacks often required more development time. However, he also acknowledged the value of learning behind an established veteran, citing the situation of rookie Jaxson Dart, who will be backing up Russell Wilson, as a path that can be highly beneficial for a player's long-term career.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a bill raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year.

The move is intended to provide relief to taxpayers in high-tax states, though critics argue it primarily benefits wealthier households.

The name change to Defense in 1947 was a deliberate move under President Truman to unify the armed services and shift focus toward deterring conflict in the nuclear age.

          <p>In one of the largest single-site enforcement actions in Department of Homeland Security history, federal agents detained approximately 475 workers at a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant under construction in Georgia. The raid, part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices, has halted work at the facility, a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution. The South Korean government has expressed concern over the raid's impact on its companies and citizens, many of whom were among those detained. The operation highlights the disruptive effect of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies on major international business investments in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, sparking a frenzy of ticket buying that is significantly boosting business for lottery courier services like Jackpocket, owned by DraftKings. The company reported a 130% day-over-day increase in Powerball ticket sales on its platform, which operates in 16 states. DraftKings acquired Jackpocket in 2024, viewing it as a key asset for cross-selling customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming products. The massive jackpot highlights the lucrative, if unpredictable, nature of the lottery market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This sharp decline offers potential relief for homebuyers who have been facing rates in the high 6% range for months. For a buyer of a median-priced home, this drop could translate to a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains uncertain whether this decrease will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty continue to sideline many potential buyers.

          <p>CBS News announced that its Sunday program "Face the Nation" will no longer edit taped interviews, presenting them either live or "live to tape" without alterations. The policy change comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem publicly complained that the show had "shamefully edited" her recent appearance to remove potentially defamatory remarks she made about a deported man. While editing for time and clarity is standard practice in broadcast news, CBS stated the new policy is for "greater transparency." The move is seen by some as a capitulation to political pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

A third juvenile suspect remains at large. The two arrested individuals, Jalen Lucas and Kelvin Thomas Jr., will be charged with first-degree murder and prosecuted as adults. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro described Tarpinian-Jachym as an innocent bystander and used the announcement to criticize the D.C.

Despite opposition from state agencies and environmental groups, who warn the decade-old pipelines are corroded and unsafe, the administration celebrated the company's announcement. Critics argue this move is another example of the administration's political retribution against California, prioritizing corporate interests over environmental protection. Local officials and activists are mobilizing to prevent the restart, fearing a future spill could be even more catastrophic than the last.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent release of over 33,000 pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, pressure is intensifying on the Trump administration for full transparency. A bipartisan effort in Congress is pushing for the release of all government files on the case, while victims held a press conference on the Capitol steps demanding accountability. The continued focus on the scandal complicates the administration's attempts to dismiss it as a political hoax. Depending on whether new, damaging information emerges, the controversy could either escalate into a major crisis, continue as a persistent political problem, or eventually fade from public attention.</p>
