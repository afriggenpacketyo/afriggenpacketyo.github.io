          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured during a second night of violence in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, resulting in five arrests. Police responded with baton rounds and a water cannon, while cars were set on fire and homes were damaged. The unrest has been described as "racist thuggery," with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationality. The PSNI Chief Constable has stated that the police are critically underfunded and will be activating mutual aid resources, while political figures have condemned the violence and urged calm.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk expressed regret for his recent social media posts attacking President Donald Trump, admitting they "went too far." This comes after a public disagreement between the two, where Musk criticized Trump's spending bill after previously working to cut wasteful spending. Musk had also claimed Trump was in the Justice Department's files on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Trump responded by saying Musk had "totally lost it" and that he was "very disappointed" in Musk's criticisms, though both figures have appeared to soften their stances more recently, with Trump wishing Musk well and Musk responding with a heart emoji.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Montana Supreme Court upheld a lower court's decision that several state laws restricting abortion access are unconstitutional, including a ban after 20 weeks of gestation. The ruling cited the state constitution's "right to be left alone" and access to abortions, unaffected by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade. The challenged laws also included restrictions on telehealth prescriptions for abortion medication and a 24-hour waiting period. An anti-abortion group has filed a lawsuit challenging the voter-approved initiative that enshrined abortion rights in the Montana Constitution, claiming voters were not given ample time to review the full text of the initiative.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its support for the private sector, as the head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) met with tech industry representatives to gather input for Beijingâ€™s next five-year development plan. The NDRC emphasized the crucial role private enterprises can play in technological innovation and developing new quality productive forces. Since the beginning of the year, the Chinese government has adopted a more private-sector-friendly approach, including a high-level meeting between President Xi Jinping and business leaders, and a new private sector law promising fairer market competition and stronger legal protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a relatively low unemployment rate, data suggests that finding a job in the U.S. has become more difficult, as businesses are hesitant to hire due to economic uncertainty. The job-finding rate has declined, and the quits rate remains low, creating a "low hiring, low firing" environment. While the number of long-term unemployed workers has dropped, this may be due to workers leaving the labor force altogether, and the U-6 rate, which includes marginally attached workers and those employed part-time for economic reasons, remains high. The professional and business services sector, representing "white collar" jobs, has experienced a contraction, indicating fewer opportunities in fields like marketing and software development.</p>

          <p>Austria is observing three days of national mourning after a mass shooting at a high school in Graz left 10 people dead and a dozen injured.

Police found a non-functional pipe bomb and a farewell letter at the shooter's home, but the motive remains unclear. The incident has sparked renewed debate over Austria's gun laws, which already ban automatic weapons and pump-action guns but allow revolvers, pistols, and semi-automatic weapons with a permit.</p>

This decision arises from allegations that North Korea is using illicitly obtained virtual assets to fund its weapons development. Japan also seeks to strengthen collaboration with European nations supporting Ukraine, given Pyongyang's strengthening ties with Moscow in the military domain. Additionally, the G7 countries are considering establishing a task force to review tax exemptions on cross-border e-commerce involving small parcels, aiming to address the strain on customs processing and provide protection to domestic businesses.</p>

Legal scholars believe this particular appeal, based on an antiquated law, is unlikely to succeed.

          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics indicates that states with permissive gun laws experienced a rise in pediatric deaths from firearm injuries between 2011 and 2023, while states with stricter laws did not. Researchers grouped states based on their gun laws and found that those with the most permissive laws had a 67% relative increase in firearm deaths. Experts suggest that future research should focus on identifying specific laws that effectively prevent gun deaths in children and teens. Child access prevention laws, which penalize allowing a child to access a gun, have been shown to decrease suicides and unintentional injuries.</p>

Advocates worry that schools will have competing needs and may not prioritize resources for homeless students, potentially leading to a lack of support and a decrease in the identification of students experiencing homelessness. The Education Department trusts that states will use the flexibility provided to them to better meet the needs of all students, including homeless children and youth.</p>

          <p>Protests against immigration raids, which began in Los Angeles, have spread across the country, prompting President Trump to mobilize National Guard troops and Marines. Demonstrations have emerged in cities like Austin, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and New York City. The Trump administration intends to continue its program of raids and deportations despite the protests, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stating that "ICE will continue to enforce the law." Governors in states like Texas have deployed the National Guard to ensure peace and order, emphasizing that peaceful protest is legal but harming people or property is not.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian analyzes President Trump's ongoing attacks on universities like Harvard and Columbia as part of a decades-long Republican effort to humble these institutions for political reasons, stemming from a trend that college-educated people tend to vote Democratic. The article references a 1978 book titled 'Harvard Hates America' as an early example of this sentiment. The author argues that Trump's actions are following a script outlined in Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership, which advocates for prioritizing trade schools and military academies over traditional universities, and restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p>
