          <p>President Donald Trump touted a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., stating it would create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. A White House official indicated Trump's social media post suggested he had approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, despite previous concerns about national security risks. The deal is expected to maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and spur significant investment in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's tax and spending plans, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," are facing increased skepticism from Wall Street, leading to market unease. The plans include extending tax cuts introduced in 2017, offset by spending cuts, and imposing 50% tariffs on all EU imports. Concerns are rising over the US's "twin deficit" position and the potential for inflation and recession. Economists debate the dangers of high debt levels, while investors warn that patience is wearing thin with Trump's erratic policymaking.</p>

          <p>Inspired by calls for alternatives to policing from Black and brown organizers, Seattle leaders launched a third public safety department that responds to mental health crises. Austin has increasingly invested more money in its homeless services since the city diverted millions of dollars from the 2021 police budget to go toward permanent supportive housing instead. Organizers hope the Trump administration’s commitment to capital punishment and increasing law enforcement will inspire people to again envision alternatives to policing. The defund movement helped catapult the model from the advocacy space into the national dialogue, and continues to inspire change today.</p>

A new style guide bans the term "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism," and proposed budget cuts would eliminate offices working on countering violent extremism. Officials suspect these changes stem from a desire to prioritize threats that resonate with Trump's base. Experts fear the administration is deprioritizing the threat from the far right, potentially emboldening far-right terrorist groups.</p>

The popularity of remote work in the UK is attributed to commuting costs and length. A separate poll suggests many workers would resist full-time return-to-office mandates.</p>

Animals raised for food are frequently transported in conditions that lead to stress, injury, and death, with little accountability for companies.

Modern-day fish embryos also showed nerves in their tooth-like scales, indicating that the armor allowed them to sense their environment.</p>
