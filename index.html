          <p>Russia initiated a significant assault on Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region early Saturday, with explosions reported in Dnipro and Pavlograd. Regional Governor Sergiy Lysak urged residents to seek shelter, noting two prior deaths from overnight attacks. While Dnipropetrovsk has largely avoided heavy fighting since the 2022 invasion, Kyiv confirmed Russian troops recently entered the area, though it is not among Moscow's claimed regions. This attack coincides with discussions on a potential EU military training mission in Ukraine and renewed White House calls for President Trump to mediate ceasefire and peace negotiations between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin, a prospect French President Macron views with skepticism.</p>

          <p>Japan is set to deploy the US-made Typhon intermediate-range missile system for the first time during joint military exercises with the United States next month, a move widely interpreted as a strategic signal against Beijing, particularly concerning a potential conflict over Taiwan. China's foreign ministry strongly opposed this deployment on Friday, stating it would further undermine the legitimate security interests of other countries in Asia and urged both nations not to proceed. The system will be temporarily stationed at the US Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi prefecture during drills with a notional Chinese enemy, though it is scheduled for withdrawal post-exercise, highlighting rising tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated a Justice Department paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making a vulgar gesture and disparaging remarks to National Guard members in Washington D.C. on August 18. The dismissal was immediate, with DoJ spokespersons confirming the firing and emphasizing the department's stance on supporting law enforcement. This incident occurred amidst President Donald Trump's deployment of hundreds of National Guard troops to the capital, citing a crime emergency and a temporary federal takeover of the city's police. The article highlights the ongoing tensions and disciplinary actions within the federal government regarding its operations in major cities.</p>

          <p>California and Texas, the two most populous US states, are at the heart of an intense political battle over congressional redistricting, drawing in other state governments and poised to impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. After Texas enacted a measure to add five Republican-favoring seats mid-decade, California lawmakers responded by redrawing its own maps to boost Democratic representation by five seats, aiming to offset the Texas move. Missouri has also joined, with its governor ordering a special session to add a Republican seat. This "political arms race" for power is rapidly spreading nationwide ahead of next year's midterm elections, illustrating how gerrymandering, though legal unless racially motivated, allows politicians to pick voters.</p>

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb pauses a January directive that extended expedited removal beyond border areas and recent arrivals to anywhere in the country for those who arrived within the past two years. This decision is a major setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts, which had relied on this expansion to arrest asylum-seekers at courthouses. Cobb's opinion stated that the government must afford due process to a large group of people not previously subject to expedited removal, finding current procedures fall short.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie, the final British singles player, was eliminated from the US Open after losing to 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round. Djokovic, despite battling a lower back injury that required medical time-outs in the early sets, secured a 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 victory in a contest lasting almost three hours. This marks Norrie's seventh consecutive defeat to the 38-year-old Serb, who is now aiming for a standalone record 25th major title. Djokovic, playing his first tournament since Wimbledon, joked that his team wants him to "suffer on the court" to spend more minutes there.</p>

Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, erosion control, and drainage systems.

          <p>Three men were arrested during a protest outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, UK, following a Court of Appeal decision that overturned a temporary injunction blocking asylum seekers from being housed there.

The ruling means 138 asylum seekers will not be forced to leave by September 12.

Participants like Miller, 12, report improved focus and calmness, fostering healthy relationships and self-esteem through consistent interaction.</p>

          <p>New findings by authorities suggest that the late Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, a Hollywood inspiration for "Walking Tall," murdered his wife, Pauline Mullins Pusser, in 1967 and fabricated the story that his enemies were responsible. Prosecutors now state there is enough evidence for an indictment if Pusser, who died seven years later, were alive. The reexamination of the cold case by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation revealed inconsistencies in Pusser's account and evidence suggesting Pauline was shot outside the car, then placed inside, along with signs of prior domestic violence. Pauline's brother expressed closure from the investigation.</p>

          <p>CVS and Walgreens are now limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in some states, requiring prescriptions or not offering them at all, to comply with state guidelines tied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approvals. The FDA has approved Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax vaccines for seniors, but only for younger adults and children with health conditions. CVS cannot vaccinate even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico due to specific state laws and regulations. This situation follows new recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics that, for the first time in 30 years, differ from current U.S. government advice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine, published in JAMA Network Open, indicates that young children aged 3 to 5 diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently prescribed medication too quickly, often before behavioral interventions are fully explored. The study, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that about 68% received medication before age seven, with 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Researchers and clinical psychologists emphasize starting with behavioral intervention due to potential side effects like irritability and a high likelihood of treatment failure with early medication. The study highlights the need for further investigation into early medication appropriateness.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has significantly curtailed President Trump's power to impose sweeping tariffs by ruling that many of his import taxes, justified under national emergencies, exceed his authority. The 7-4 decision largely upheld a lower court's finding that Trump went too far with his "Liberation Day" and border-related tariffs, but it allowed the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. This ruling is a major setback for Trump's trade strategy, potentially impacting his ability to impose future levies and raising concerns about economic stability and higher consumer prices, with the Justice Department warning of "financial ruin" if tariffs are revoked.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris will receive protection from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) after President Trump revoked her Secret Service security detail, which had been extended by President Biden until July 2026. California officials swiftly implemented a plan for dignitary protection, with Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemning the move as "erratic, vindictive political impulses" that endanger Harris. This decision follows Trump's pattern of stripping security from former allies and critics, including his former national security advisor and Biden's children. Harris is set to begin a 15-stop book tour next month, adding urgency to her security arrangements.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is exploring ways to accelerate the reinstatement process for former service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, with officials weighing granting honorable discharges to those whose departures were solely due to vaccine refusal. While hundreds have applied, fewer than two dozen have been reinstated, causing frustration among veterans. This potential policy change follows President Trump's executive order to reinstate these troops, calling the mandate an "unfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to address the issue soon, with the department prioritizing cases and offering incentives like back pay and duty station preferences.</p>

Newsom's remarks were part of his broader criticism of Trump's deployments of the National Guard to predominantly blue states like Los Angeles and Washington D.C., arguing for a focus on states with demonstrably worse crime statistics if the goal is truly crime suppression.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's U.S. House districts, aiming to secure a partisan advantage for Republicans in next year's congressional elections. This move, praised by President Trump, follows similar actions in Texas and California, marking Missouri as the third state to pursue mid-decade redistricting. The proposed map targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas. Democrats have expressed outrage, calling it an "attack on democracy" and a "Trump puppet" attempt to steal a congressional seat, also noting a proposed constitutional amendment to make citizen-initiated ballot measures harder.</p>

Analysts attribute this shift to changing consumer trends, a preference for healthier options, and the rising cost of living, which makes unique, affordable treats more appealing.
