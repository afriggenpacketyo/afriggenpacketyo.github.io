          <p>Myanmar's military has conducted a major raid on KK Park, a well-known cybercrime hub near the Thai border, detaining 2,198 individuals. The operation is part of a broader crackdown on online fraud, which often involves luring foreign workers under false pretenses and forcing them into criminal activities. Authorities also seized dozens of unlicensed Starlink satellite internet terminals used by the operation. The military government has accused the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic group, of involvement, a claim the group denies.</p>

Healy has been a key player for the defending champions, who have already secured a spot in the semi-finals. Beth Mooney will take over as wicketkeeper, while Tahlia McGrath is set to captain the team in Healy's absence. The team is awaiting further assessment to determine if she can return later in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Chinese memory chip manufacturer ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) is reportedly planning an initial public offering in Shanghai, potentially valuing the company at up to $42.12 billion. Sources suggest the listing could occur as early as the first quarter of the upcoming year, aiming to raise between 20 billion and 40 billion yuan. This move is part of China's strategic effort to establish a stronger presence in the global DRAM market, which has historically been dominated by foreign companies.

The campaign has grown more personal, with attacks focusing on Sherrill's military record and Ciattarelli's past business dealings.

          <p>The widespread internet outage on Monday was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error at one of Amazon Web Services' (AWS) largest data centers. DNS acts as the internet's address book, and when it failed, it could no longer direct traffic to thousands of websites and apps that rely on AWS infrastructure. Experts note that this type of error is common but had a massive impact due to the concentration of services on a single provider. The incident illustrates the risks of the internet's heavy reliance on a few tech giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Sean Dyche as its new manager on a contract running until 2027, making him the club's third boss this season. Dyche, formerly of Burnley and Everton, succeeds Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked after just 39 days and failed to win any of his eight games in charge. The club is currently in 18th place in the Premier League table after a difficult start to the season. Dyche's appointment is seen as a pragmatic move aimed at ensuring the team's survival in the top flight.</p>

          <p>Construction work has started on a new ballroom at the White House, a project championed by Donald Trump. Photos show demolition underway on the facade of the East Wing to make way for the new structure. Trump has stated that the $250 million project will be privately funded by donors and himself, and that it will be a separate building that respects the existing historical landmark. The project has reportedly begun despite not yet having formal approval from the federal agency that oversees such construction, and has drawn criticism as an "utter desecration."</p>

          <p>The co-author of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir stated that Giuffre would have considered Prince Andrew giving up his royal titles a significant victory. The book, released this week, details Giuffre's allegations of sexual assault involving Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew, which he has consistently denied. The co-author, Amy Wallace, noted that while Andrew's decision to stop using his titles is symbolic, it represents a form of accountability. She also urged the prince to cooperate with U.S. investigators by sharing what he witnessed during his time with Epstein.</p>

          <p>A collaborative research team from China and Australia has identified two protein enzymes crucial for the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. The discovery centers on the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which fuels the disease, and a mechanism that could potentially regulate it. This breakthrough could pave the way for a new therapeutic strategy to combat prostate cancer, a disease that affects an estimated 1.5 million men globally each year. The findings offer hope for more effective treatments that can overcome resistance to current therapies.</p>

          <p>Exporters at China's Canton Fair are observing a growing trend of international clients opting to use the yuan for trade settlements. A representative from a power-equipment manufacturer noted that customers from Southeast Asian and Central Asian countries are increasingly requesting to pay in yuan. For her company, yuan-settled orders have risen to 10-20% of total exports, up from single digits the previous year. This shift is partly driven by Chinese suppliers leading infrastructure projects in developing nations, which encourages the use of their national currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following four consecutive defeats, this article analyzes the pressing issues facing Liverpool manager Arne Slot. Despite a summer spending spree of nearly £450 million on new talent, the team is struggling with a vulnerable defense, lethargic midfield, and ineffective attack. Key questions include how to address the poor form of star player Mohamed Salah and whether to persist with big-money signing Alexander Isak, who has yet to score. The manager also faces dilemmas in solidifying the team's midfield and finding a stable solution for the right-back position following Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure.</p>

The weather phenomenon is forecast to bring flooding rain and significant mountain snow to parts of California, Oregon, and Washington. The National Weather Service has cautioned that travel will likely be impacted by the severe conditions. Atmospheric rivers are concentrated plumes of moisture that can carry vast amounts of water vapor, and research suggests climate change may be making them longer, wider, and more intense.</p>
