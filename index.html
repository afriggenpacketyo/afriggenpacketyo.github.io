          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the author's experience as a visiting scholar at Harvard University, contrasting it with President Trump's apparent perception. The author, who grew up in West Germany with an idealized view of America and Harvard, found the university to be a place of academic inquiry and bridging differences. The author expresses concern over the Trump administration's potential elimination of visa programs that enable international scholars to contribute to Harvard's academic community. A US district judge blocked the White House‚Äôs attempt to revoke Harvard‚Äôs certification to enroll foreign students, while the State Department has cancelled all future interviews for applicants who want to obtain a visa to study in the US.</p>

The share of small business owners planning to create new jobs fell in May, according to the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB). Owners are foregoing filling open positions given their heightened sensitivity to labor costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House pointed to Isaacman's ties to the Democratic Party as a factor in the decision.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador, has been returned to the United States to face charges related to an alleged undocumented immigrant smuggling ring.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how anti-managerialism, a political thought that views a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats as having usurped democracy, is central to understanding the Trump administration's policies. It argues that this idea, once marginalized, has become a core principle of the New Right and drives efforts to transform institutions from government to universities. The author suggests that populist politics can be seen as part of an anti-managerial revolution aimed at rolling back bureaucratic control. Despite limited success, understanding this concept is essential for grasping the Trump administration's institutional transformation efforts.</p>

These robots would go directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans, reducing delivery times and labor costs. Amazon is reportedly testing these AI-powered humanoid robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. (not investment advice)</p>
