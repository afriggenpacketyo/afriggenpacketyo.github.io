          <p>Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike saw its stock surge after presenting a highly optimistic long-term financial roadmap at its investor day. The company projected significant growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR), aiming for $10 billion by 2031 and $20 billion by 2036, alongside expanding operating and free cash flow margins. This positive forecast is partly driven by the company's strategic focus on securing artificial intelligence agents, a rapidly growing sector with new vulnerabilities, and its recent acquisition of AI security startup Pangea.

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, U.S. President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to consider using military force to control the country's borders and stop illegal migration. At a joint press conference, Trump drew parallels between the UK's situation with small boat crossings and the US southern border, stating such measures are necessary to prevent a country from being destroyed "from within." The discussion occurred as Starmer's government began its "one in, one out" migrant deportation deal with France, highlighting ongoing political pressures on the issue.</p>

          <p>Disney's ABC network has indefinitely suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after the host linked the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The move follows pressure from the Trump administration and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr, who suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk. This event is part of a broader pattern of the administration's intensified scrutiny of media companies, which includes high-profile lawsuits and regulatory interference, raising concerns about free speech. In a related case, the article notes a previous lawsuit where a network paid into Trump's library after he claimed an anchor inaccurately stated he was found liable for sexually assaulting a writer.</p>

          <p>A new film by director Paul Thomas Anderson, titled "One Battle After Another," is receiving praise for its compelling blend of high-stakes action and timely political commentary. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former anti-fascist vigilante living in hiding, the movie explores themes of government overreach and political violence in a contemporary American setting. The article highlights the film's departure from Anderson's typically historical settings, delivering a bleak but captivating story that feels both urgent and emotionally resonant. Strong performances from DiCaprio, Sean Penn, and newcomer Chase Infiniti are also noted as key strengths.</p>

          <p>Transportation ministers from Germany's 16 federal states have unanimously agreed to raise the price of the "Deutschlandticket," a popular monthly pass for nationwide local and regional public transit. The cost will increase to €63 per month starting in January 2026, marking the second price hike since its introduction. While officials describe the new price as an affordable compromise to ensure the program's continuation until 2030, mobility and environmental associations have criticized the decision.

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has sparked a significant debate over free speech, as the Trump administration takes action against individuals mocking or celebrating his death. Attorney General Pam Bondi has suggested the administration would pursue those engaging in "hate speech," while the State Department plans to revoke visas for similar social media posts. Legal experts interviewed in the article express alarm, stating that such government actions set a dangerous precedent and misinterpret First Amendment protections, which generally shield even offensive and hateful speech. They argue that the government should not be the arbiter of acceptable discourse, regardless of political affiliation.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor Group has confirmed it will proceed with a $2.7 billion expansion of its electric vehicle plant in Georgia, despite a recent immigration raid that delayed a related battery facility and created diplomatic tensions. The investment will increase the plant's production capacity to 500,000 vehicles annually and expand its lineup to ten electric and hybrid models, including a new mid-sized pickup truck. The decision reaffirms the company's long-term strategic commitment to localizing production in the United States. Both Hyundai and Georgia officials have been working to mitigate the fallout from the raid, which involved the arrest of over 300 South Korean citizens.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the singer's concerns as "fearmongering," but industry insiders report ongoing worries about potential targeting at cultural events.

          <p>A federal jury has acquitted a Los Angeles protester, Brayan Ramos-Brito, of assaulting a border patrol agent during a demonstration in June, a verdict seen as a setback for federal prosecutors. The defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents' testimony, particularly that of border patrol chief Gregory Bovino, who was the only agent to claim he witnessed the assault. Witness footage, which showed an agent forcefully shoving the protester but did not capture an assault by him, contradicted the official account. The trial also highlighted factual discrepancies in initial DHS reports and brought up past misconduct allegations against Bovino, undermining the prosecution's case.</p>

During their private meeting, Starmer likely attempted to persuade Trump to adopt a tougher stance on Russia and reconsider his approach to the Middle East. While Trump expressed personal disappointment with Vladimir Putin, his public comments on both conflicts showed little deviation from his established views. The article suggests the true test of the visit's success will be whether Trump's administration takes more concrete action, such as enforcing sanctions.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic reflects on the historical and ongoing tension within American higher education, which has been pulled between three competing purposes: cultural formation, career preparation, and academic research. The article traces this conflict back to the late 19th century, contrasting the classical, culture-focused curriculum of the old college model with the practical, career-oriented vision championed by figures like Harvard President Charles W. Eliot. This push-and-pull, later complicated by the rise of the research-focused university, created a hybrid system with inherent contradictions. The author argues that this foundational debate over what college is for has never been resolved and remains urgent today.</p>

Payments will range from $150 to $400, depending on the taxpayer's 2023 filing status and adjusted gross income, and will be sent automatically to those who qualify. Financial experts advise recipients to use the funds to bolster emergency savings or pay down high-interest debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show represents a serious threat to American democracy by targeting humor, a crucial pillar of a free society. The author traces the history of political satire in the U.S., from Benjamin Franklin to "Saturday Night Live," emphasizing its role in mocking power, revealing truths, and fostering dissent. The article contends that autocrats worldwide have always recognized the power of comedy and sought to silence it. ABC's capitulation to pressure from the Trump administration's FCC is presented as a dangerous sign of institutional decay and an acceleration of America's illiberal turn.</p>

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the deal as an "incredible investment" and stated Nvidia would become a very large customer of Intel's CPUs. The deal highlights a dramatic shift in the semiconductor industry, driven by the AI boom that has propelled Nvidia's valuation far beyond that of the historically dominant Intel.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The administration had attempted to expel the minors over Labor Day weekend, claiming it was reuniting them with their families at the request of the Guatemalan government. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that the children's parents had requested their return. In fact, a Guatemalan government report revealed that officials could not find a single parent who affirmatively wanted their child sent back, undermining the administration's entire premise.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with substantial credit card debt, such as a $75,000 balance, debt forgiveness through settlement can offer significant relief. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a reduced lump sum, often resulting in a 30% to 50% reduction of the total amount owed. The article contrasts this with the slow and costly process of making traditional payments on high-interest debt, which can take over a decade and accrue massive interest charges. While debt settlement can impact one's credit score, it provides a much faster path to becoming debt-free for those in overwhelming financial situations. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling states that Khalil misrepresented his background on his green card application.

The judge's order was issued without a full hearing on the evidence, which the legal team called a procedural irregularity.

          <p>The indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC has drawn widespread condemnation from Democratic politicians, civil rights groups, and Hollywood figures, who label the move an act of government censorship. The decision followed public pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, over Kimmel's monologue about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Critics, including former President Barack Obama, argue the Trump administration is abusing its regulatory power to silence dissenting voices, creating a dangerous precedent for the First Amendment. House Democratic leaders have called for Carr's resignation and announced an investigation into the matter.</p>

Some new members advocated for removing the combination option for children under four, citing safety concerns.

In a letter, Parkinson explained that the evidence did not meet the high legal threshold required for a conviction under the outdated Official Secrets Act 1911, which would have necessitated proving China was an "enemy."
