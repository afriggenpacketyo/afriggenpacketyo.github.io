          <p>Mortgage rates have increased for the third consecutive week, reaching their highest point since January, yet demand from homebuyers continues to grow. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, purchase applications rose by 2% compared to the previous week and are 18% higher than the same week last year, driven by increased housing inventory. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.98%, while refinance applications fell by 7%, though still 37% higher than a year ago. Despite a stronger than expected Consumer Confidence Index, concerns over the labor market may push rates slightly lower in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to lift restrictions imposed by a federal judge on deportations to third countries. Solicitor General John Sauer argues that Judge Brian Murphy's mandate, requiring specific due process procedures for immigrants slated for deportation, creates a logistical and diplomatic challenge. The judge's order was issued after detainees claimed they couldn't raise fears of torture, prompting the judge to halt removals unless detainees were given notice of their destination and sufficient time to raise safety concerns. The Supreme Court has previously affirmed non-citizens' right to due process, but the specifics remain contested, as the administration pushes for aggressive removal of unlawful immigrants.</p>

          <p>Macy's has lowered its full-year profit forecast due to the impact of higher tariffs, increased promotional activities, and a moderation in discretionary spending, even as it surpassed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations.

The company's net income for the quarter was $38 million, down from $62 million in the same period last year, with comparable sales declining at Macy's namesake brand but increasing at Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. Macy's is continuing its turnaround efforts by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury and beauty segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Airline passengers in Turkey who unbuckle their seat belts or access overhead compartments before the plane has completely stopped will now face fines, according to new regulations from the Turkish civil aviation authority.

Commercial airlines are required to issue revised in-flight announcements warning passengers of the fines, which could be up to $70. The aviation authority noted that many passengers stand up before the aircraft reaches its parking position, compromising safety and disregarding the satisfaction of other travelers.</p>

The company's net income for the quarter was $264 million, with sales rising to $3.17 billion, up about 5% from the previous year, and the outlook doesn't include costs or results from the acquisition of Foot Locker.

          <p>President Trump's 'peace through strength' strategy faces challenges due to military vulnerabilities, including an overextended force, industrial base limitations, and readiness issues. While Trump has achieved security goals such as dismantling ISIS and targeting Houthis, operations in the Middle East have strained readiness in Asia, with potential munition shortages revealing industrial challenges. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered an Army restructuring to counter China's capabilities, yet the administration's proposed defense budget may fall short of promised levels, potentially hindering the strategy's implementation. Despite these issues, congressional partners are prepared to support the strategy with increased funding for shipbuilding and other priorities, aiming to rebuild military strength and deliver lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Following the expensive 'Maycember' period, characterized by a convergence of graduations, school events, and summer plans, financial experts recommend returning to a basic budget. Reviewing spending and reassessing financial plans are key steps, particularly addressing any accumulated credit card debt through strategies like the avalanche or snowball method. Automating savings, such as setting up recurring transfers to an emergency fund, is also advised to rebuild after heavy spending. Scaling back on discretionary expenses and seeking side gigs can further accelerate debt repayment and financial recovery, and it is important to plan ahead for next year's expenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The socialist left often explains the rise of right-wing populism as a result of center-left parties betraying their working-class base through neoliberal policies, leading to economic rage that far-right populists capitalize on. However, this analysis is flawed due to the left's commitment to materialism, which assumes that far-right voting has a materialist cause, dismissing the independent causal force of ideas, values, and identities. While material concerns are relevant, the far right's rise is better explained by a change in the ideological structure of global politics, where an egalitarian vision has unsettled traditionally-minded segments of the population. By articulating ideas matching deeply held beliefs and values, the right wins support, making a postmaterial analytic framework essential for the left to understand and counter the far right's power.</p>

He proposed radical reforms, such as fewer policing organizations and a national police agency, to address growing pressures from global threats and social volatility. The Home Office has stated it is backing the police with significant funding, but Rowley insists that without additional resources, the government's commitments cannot be fully realized.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly finalizing the transfer of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for a fee of Â£51 million, with the player scheduled to undergo a medical examination. Once Zubimendi passes the medical, Arsenal will announce the signing, completing a deal that has been in development for several months. In addition to Zubimendi, Arsenal is also targeting a new center-forward, with Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres among their preferred options. The club is also in talks regarding new contracts for key players such as Bukayo Saka and William Saliba.</p>

          <p>The AI industrial trade has regained momentum, with GE Vernova outperforming peers like Eaton and Vertiv, closing at an all-time high for the sixth consecutive session. While Eaton and Vertiv have also rallied, they have yet to return to pre-DeepSeek levels, and GE Vernova's success is attributed to being earlier in a potential revenue upcycle and having a larger backlog of customer orders. Recent deals, such as the $14.2 billion gas turbines and energy solutions deal with Saudi Arabia and an executive order supporting the U.S. nuclear power industry, have further boosted GE Vernova's stock, leading the Club to downgrade it to a hold-equivalent 2 rating due to the rapid increase.

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to Â£1,000, and may have debts written off following a scandal involving the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay over Â£70 million in compensation and financial support after a review by Ofgem found suppliers fell short of required standards when switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. Eligible customers will receive payments based on how they were treated, with higher amounts for 'inappropriate installations,' and while most have already received help, Ofgem is continuing enforcement investigations for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo. A new code of practice with stricter conditions is now in place to prevent such installations without customer consent.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have expressed concerns about the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to ease prison overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued that the plans 'could be of net detriment to public safety,' citing concerns about electronic tagging costs and repeat offenders avoiding jail. While acknowledging the government's difficult problem, the Met Police chief said the proposed solutions would create extra work for the police, and he requested data on the types of offenders who would be managed in communities. The government maintains that the proposals address many of their concerns, with repeat offenders still facing short sentences and terrorists ineligible for earlier release.</p>
