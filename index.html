          <h2>Trump Administration Plans to Significantly Reduce the Department of Education</h2>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order aiming to substantially reduce the Department of Education's size and authority, shifting power back to individual states.  This action fulfills a campaign promise but faces potential roadblocks in Congress and raises concerns about the impact on vital funding programs for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The administration plans to transfer some key programs to other agencies.</p>

          <h2>Lawsuit Filed Against Trump Administration Over Student Loan Repayment Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-20 07:33:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Federation of Teachers filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education, alleging that the administration's halting of affordable student loan repayment plans violates federal law.  The lawsuit claims the action denies borrowers access to affordable payments and blocks progress toward loan forgiveness, impacting millions of borrowers. The Department of Education cites a court injunction as the reason for the pause, but the union argues this interpretation is overly broad and has created significant disruption.</p>

          <p>New data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) project suggests that dark energy, the mysterious force accelerating the expansion of the universe, may be weakening. This finding, while not yet definitive, could have profound implications for cosmological models and our understanding of the universe's ultimate fate, potentially leading to a 'Big Crunch' scenario instead of indefinite expansion. Further research is needed to confirm these results.</p>
