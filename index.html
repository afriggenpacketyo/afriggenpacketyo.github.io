        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant setback to his economic agenda. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to impose such sweeping duties. The Trump administration has swiftly appealed the ruling, with a White House spokesperson asserting that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has created a national emergency. The lawsuit was brought by U.S. businesses reliant on imports, and the judges ordered the tariffs to be vacated and permanently stopped. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has cancelled a contract with Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine against pandemic flu strains, including the H5N1 bird flu virus, citing safety concerns regarding mRNA technology. HHS stated that continued investment in Moderna's vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable, prioritizing vaccine platforms with better-established safety profiles. Experts have criticized the decision, arguing that it endangers public health and reduces the country's pandemic preparedness. Moderna maintains that its study showed positive interim results and will explore alternative paths forward for the program, while others worry that this will negatively impact the ability to develop vaccines quickly during a pandemic.</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked President Trump's large-scale tariffs on numerous foreign nations, ruling that the levies exceed the president's legal authority. The court halted the 10% tariffs imposed on trading partners and a separate set of tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, which were justified by the administration citing drug trafficking and illegal immigration. The court rejected the administration's interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that it would be unconstitutional to grant the president blanket authority to set tariffs. A White House spokesperson defended the tariffs, arguing that trade deficits have created a national emergency, but the court's decision stands for now.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended some sales of critical U.S. technologies to China, including those related to jet engines and semiconductors, in response to China’s restrictions on exports of critical minerals to the United States. This move is pushing the world's largest economies closer to supply chain warfare, as Washington and Beijing try to assert control over essential economic components. The restrictions could affect companies that rely on foreign technologies and complicate efforts to resolve the trade dispute over tariff policies.

This push to expand manufacturing capabilities is part of China's goal to achieve self-reliance, especially in high-tech sectors, which could conflict with the Trump administration's demands in ongoing trade talks.

          <p>President Trump has suggested that Harvard should cap the number of international students it admits to create more spots for Americans, which contradicts his administration's argument that merit alone should guide admissions. He expressed outrage that about one-fourth of Harvard’s student body is made up of international students. Trump has also targeted noncitizen students involved in campus protests related to the war in Gaza for arrest and removal from the country. He has repeatedly used the protests to target international students, connecting those complaints to his broader campaign against Harvard.</p>

          <p>President Trump is increasingly using his clemency powers to undermine Justice Department cases against his supporters. He is rewarding allies and supporters who claim they were prosecuted for political reasons by a weaponized Justice Department. This approach has created an incentive for pardon seekers to demonstrate their fealty to him and accuse the Biden Justice Department of singling them out because of their support. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced a raft of pardons, which wipe away convictions, and commutations, which cut sentences short.</p>

In one incident, Nash testified that Combs showed up at Ventura's apartment while she was asleep, grabbed her by the hair, and started beating her until she hit her head on a bedframe and was bleeding profusely.</p>

The $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry, and Nvidia is taking a multibillion-dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed. Despite this, Nvidia reported 69% year-over-year revenue growth, but Huang is making his dissatisfaction with the China situation clear. In April, the Trump administration told Nvidia that its previously approved H20 processor for China would require an export license.</p>

          <p>The government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology. This change could make it easier for millions of homes in England to install heat pumps, but consumer groups warn that it won't help renters or those in leasehold properties. The biggest barrier remains the high upfront costs, particularly for older housing stock requiring upgrades to pipework and insulation. This is part of the government's Warm Homes Plan to lower household bills and cut planet-warming emissions.</p>

The ruling came in lawsuits filed by small U.S. businesses and 13 U.S. states.</p>

          <p>Conservative insiders are expressing concern over Kemi Badenoch's leadership, describing recent missteps as a "total disaster" for the party. Some question whether the Conservatives risk being overtaken by Reform UK, drawing parallels to the Liberal Party's decline in the 1920s. Badenoch's decision to delay policy announcements and the severe redundancies at Conservative Campaign Headquarters are contributing to the unease. The local election results and the surge of Reform UK have exacerbated these concerns, leading to doubts about the party's future direction.</p>

Cramer said he's focused on how AI could take over undesirable jobs but noted that CEOs are hyper-cognizant that human workers are expensive.
