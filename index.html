        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant surge, exceeding 1,000 points, driven by optimism surrounding potential de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war and President Trump's reassurance about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's position. Trump indicated a possible reduction in tariffs on China, while China has also hinted at lowering levies on American goods. The market's positive reaction is tempered by concerns about the durability of Trump's rhetoric and the potential for continued volatility influenced by trade policies, as well as a gloomy report from the International Monetary Fund that said the global economy will slow this year due to the trade war.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is asserting that undocumented migrants should not be entitled to trials before deportation, citing the impracticality of holding trials for thousands of individuals. This stance comes amid a legal dispute over deportations, with the Supreme Court temporarily blocking the administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members. The ACLU has challenged the deportations, arguing that migrants are being removed without due process, while the Trump administration defends its actions as necessary for national security. The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant erroneously deported to El Salvador, has further fueled criticism of the administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck near Istanbul, causing buildings to shake and prompting residents to flee. At least 151 people were injured, primarily from jumping from high places, and an abandoned building collapsed.

The epicenter was located near the coast of the Sea of Marmara, approximately 80 km west of Istanbul, a city of 16 million people.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has suggested that both Russia and Ukraine will need to compromise to reach a negotiated settlement, expressing hope for a swift resolution to the conflict. He acknowledged that neither country is likely to achieve its maximalist goals, with Russia unlikely to take the entire country and Ukraine unlikely to regain all territory lost since 2014. Meanwhile, another official expressed that the U.S. has presented a fair proposal and is awaiting a response from both parties, signaling a potential end to U.S. involvement if an agreement is not reached.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed over 11,500 acres and is approximately 30% contained, leading to a state of emergency declaration and the evacuation of thousands.

Fire officials expect the acreage to grow as they continue to battle the blaze, potentially making it the largest wildfire in New Jersey in 20 years.

          <p>Despite the introduction of Teen Accounts aimed at providing greater protection for young users, Instagram continues to pose significant risks to children, according to a report by the 5Rights Foundation. Researchers were able to create fake accounts using false birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. Meta, Instagram's parent company, disputes the report's findings, asserting that the new protections are helpful to parents and that the report misunderstands how Teen Accounts function. Separately, BBC News has uncovered self-harm groups on X, raising further concerns about online safety for children.</p>

Foreign visitors arriving in the U.S. by air fell nearly 10% in March compared to the previous year, while U.S. citizens flying abroad increased by 1.6%. Factors contributing to this trend include trade war tensions, high-profile detentions of visitors, President Trump's rhetoric, a strong U.S. dollar, and travel warnings, which have collectively dampened demand from international travelers. This imbalance could further widen the gap between U.S. travel revenue and American spending abroad.</p>

          <p>JD Vance stated that the US will "walk away" from negotiations unless Ukraine and Russia reach an agreement, emphasizing the urgency of halting the conflict. The US has presented a detailed proposal to both countries and awaits their response, with the potential for the US to end its involvement if no consensus is reached. Vance suggested that both sides must be willing to cede territory to achieve a ceasefire, while Zelensky has ruled out recognizing occupied Crimea as Russian territory. Meanwhile, Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine, highlighting the ongoing violence and the need for a resolution.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has been on the rise for the third consecutive day, climbing toward $95,000, driven by positive market sentiment following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and the Federal Reserve.

This surge reflects investors capitalizing on a dip in the cryptocurrency market, viewing Bitcoin as a compelling option for portfolio diversification and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.
