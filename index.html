          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer emphasized the Starmer government's commitment to international law as central to its foreign policy approach. In an interview, Hermer defended Starmer's strategy of maintaining a positive relationship with the U.S. even if it means sacrificing short-term political gains. He argued this approach has facilitated trade deals with the U.S., India, and the EU, highlighting the importance of trust and compliance in international relations. Hermer also addressed criticism of his past remarks, reaffirming the government's dedication to upholding both domestic and international law in the national interest. The attorney general's comments aim to clarify the government's position amidst diplomatic challenges, especially concerning the conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has paved the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their homeland, including conflict-ridden regions. This decision reverses a lower court order that required the government to provide migrants with an opportunity to argue against deportation to third countries where they could face torture or death. Meanwhile, President Trump has announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, claiming it will be known as the "THE 12 DAY WAR". These developments highlight ongoing shifts in immigration policy and international relations under the Trump administration.</p>

The claim asserts that the Combat Arms Earplugs, supplied to the Ministry of Defence between 2003 and 2023, had a design flaw that prevented a complete seal in the ear. The lawsuit references evidence from previous US litigation, where an internal memo acknowledged the earplugs' defects, and follows a $6 billion settlement made by 3M regarding the same earplugs supplied to the US military.

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the severity of Iran's response. He also announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire starting at midnight ET. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack from Iran was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing in advance. Trump believes Iran has "gotten it all out of their 'system,'" urging both nations to pursue peace.</p>

          <p>A Louisiana NPR station, Red River Radio, is facing potential federal funding cuts, which could severely impact news access in rural areas. The station serves as one of the few news sources in the region, providing vital information to residents, especially during emergencies like hurricanes. The cuts could reduce local news service and disconnect vulnerable communities from the world. The station relies on government funding for about 15% of its budget, and its loss could have life-threatening consequences for those who depend on it for emergency broadcasts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their homeland. The decision reverses a lower court order requiring the government to give migrants a chance to argue against being deported to third countries where they might face torture or death. The court's liberal justices dissented, calling the decision a "gross abuse." The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security.</p>

In a brief, unsigned order, the court’s conservative supermajority paused the ruling by a Boston-based federal judge who said immigrants deserved a “meaningful opportunity” to bring claims that they would face the risk of torture, persecution or even death if removed to certain countries that have agreed to take people deported from the US. As a result of Monday’s ruling, the administration will now be allowed to swiftly deport immigrants to so-called “third countries”, including a group of men held at a US military base in Djibouti who the administration tried to send to South Sudan.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel believes Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz despite recent tensions, as such action would harm its own oil exports. Braziel noted that Iran has threatened to close the strait during major conflicts for over 20 years but has never followed through due to its economic dependence on the passage. He also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are creating issues for exporters, potentially damaging the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier. Oil prices dropped on Monday, indicating that the market has concluded that Iran won't close the strait. (not investment advice)</p>
