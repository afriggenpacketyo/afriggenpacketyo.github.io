          <p>Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, making it an attractive investment during times of economic uncertainty. The price of the precious metal is subject to constant fluctuation due to a variety of factors. These include fundamental economic principles of supply and demand, broader economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Other significant influences are central bank policies and currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, in which gold is priced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China recently displayed a formidable array of advanced weaponry during a massive military parade attended by foreign leaders. The showcased hardware included new technologies such as the LY-1 laser weapon system, large AI-powered submarine drones, and stealth attack drones designed to fly alongside manned jets. Also unveiled were new nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, like the DF-5C, which is reported to have an extended range capable of reaching the United States. This demonstration highlights the country's significant progress in military modernization and its focus on developing strategic deterrents.</p>

          <p>A new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility, named "Louisiana Lockup," has opened at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, a prison historically known as Angola. The facility will house criminal illegal migrants and adds 416 beds to ICE's detention capacity, funded through a bill aimed at increasing deportations. The detainees will be located in a refurbished section of the prison once used for solitary confinement. This is the latest in a series of new detention centers established under the current administration's expanded immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Birmingham have withdrawn a theft charge against a man who was accused of stealing flowers from a public tribute to the late musician Ozzy Osbourne. The case against Parviz Jafari was dropped after a court heard that a security guard had given him permission to take the items. The Crown Prosecution Service determined there was no realistic prospect of conviction because it could not be proven that his actions were dishonest. The tributes were left by thousands of fans following the Black Sabbath frontman's death in July.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade served as a powerful display of political theater, with President Xi Jinping prominently featuring Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. This united front was interpreted as a deliberate message to the United States, positioning Xi as the influential leader of an eastern-led alliance challenging the US-dominated world order. The event, ostensibly commemorating the end of World War II, was more focused on showcasing China's future ambitions and its growing military and diplomatic power. The spectacle underscored a defiant stance against Western influence and sanctions.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's shares saw a significant 6% increase after a U.S. district judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google. The tech giant will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, a decision viewed by investors as a major victory. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the ruling allows it to continue making payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine. This outcome removed a major source of uncertainty for the company.</p>

          <p>Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka has demonstrated a significant return to form as she prepares for the US Open quarter-finals, her first since 2021. After a period of struggle and a 14-month break for the birth of her daughter, Osaka's performance has markedly improved, which many attribute to her new coach, Tomasz Wiktorowski. Her renewed confidence is evident in her powerful and clean ball-striking, which has been reminiscent of her previous title-winning runs. This resurgence marks a positive turn in her gradual comeback to the top tier of professional tennis.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his deputy, but she now faces an independent investigation into whether she breached the ministerial code. The admission has led to accusations of hypocrisy, as Rayner previously served as Labour's anti-sleaze chief.</p>

          <h2>Historical Portrayal of Children in Art Explored</h2>

          <p>The depiction of children in art has evolved significantly throughout history, reflecting changing societal values and norms. In early periods, children were often portrayed as religious figures like the infant Jesus or as miniature adults in noble portraits designed to secure political marriages. As society shifted, art began to capture romanticized images of peasant children and, later, the carefree, playful nature of bourgeois childhood. The advent of photography and smartphones has further transformed the portrayal of children, making it more spontaneous while raising new questions about privacy and consent.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that technology has transitioned from a neutral force for global progress to a critical battlefront in geopolitics. Nations are increasingly practicing "techno-nationalism," using industrial policy, export controls, and state funding to gain a strategic advantage. The United States' CHIPS Act, China's push for self-reliance in semiconductors, and the EU's focus on technological sovereignty are all examples of this trend. In this new reality, technological leadership in areas like AI and 6G is seen as integral to national security and global influence.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since April, overall mortgage application volume in the U.S. fell last week. A 3% decline in applications for home purchases offset a minor 1% increase in refinancing activity, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This trend suggests that high home prices and persistent affordability challenges continue to be a significant barrier for potential buyers. The pullback in purchase demand follows four consecutive weeks of gains, indicating that the housing market remains in a rut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has launched an aggressive social media campaign to meet its goal of hiring over 10,000 new ICE officers. The recruitment effort uses a mix of militaristic imagery, patriotic messaging, and memes commonly found in far-right online spaces. The campaign targets a wide demographic, from former military personnel to Gen Z, with incentives like student loan forgiveness. Experts note the strategy appears to replicate military recruitment tactics and may attract individuals with xenophobic views, raising concerns about the agency's future direction.</p>

The investment bank predicts that the pace of decline in sales and profitability for major developers will slow significantly. While a 10% decrease in sales is expected for the full year, the fourth quarter could see a pickup, supported by a large inventory of completed homes in major cities.
