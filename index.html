        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new political memoir, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris recounts her stunned reaction to then-President Joe Biden's 2024 debate performance, particularly his failure to acknowledge the 13 U.S. service members killed during the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Harris writes that she was shocked by the omission, noting how personally significant that event was and how it represented a missed opportunity to contrast his record with Donald Trump's past remarks about fallen soldiers. The article highlights this specific criticism from the book, which also contains Harris's own factual error, misidentifying all 13 casualties as Marines. This revelation provides insight into the internal dynamics and frustrations within the Democratic campaign during a critical period.</p>

          <p>Another person has died while attempting to cross the English Channel, with their body discovered on a beach in northern France amid a weekend surge in crossing attempts. This recent fatality adds to a growing number of deaths this year, which now stands at 27, including two Somali women who died just a day earlier. Nearly 900 migrants are believed to have made the perilous journey in a single day due to favorable weather conditions. The incident underscores the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Channel, as record numbers of people continue to risk their lives in small, makeshift boats despite increased prevention efforts. This situation continues to mount political pressure on the UK government to address the issue.</p>

          <p>A major Russian aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles struck Ukraine, killing at least four people in the capital city of Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl. The sustained 12-hour bombardment, one of the heaviest in recent months, also targeted six other regions, injuring at least 70 people and damaging critical civilian infrastructure like a cardiology clinic and residential buildings. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as "vile," stating it demonstrates Moscow's desire to continue the war and calling for a strong international response. This significant escalation in attacks on the capital occurred just as the UN General Assembly concluded, underscoring Russia's disregard for recent diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <h2>China Expands Soft Power in Africa Through Traditional Chinese Medicine</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 08:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is strategically expanding its influence in Africa by promoting Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), recently opening new treatment and training facilities in Tunisia and Chad. This initiative is part of Beijing's broader health diplomacy strategy, which has involved sending medical teams to the continent for decades to build goodwill and cultural ties. The establishment of these centers, such as the one at Mongi Slim University Hospital in Tunisia, reflects a concerted effort to use cultural exchange as a tool for soft power. By embedding TCM into the healthcare landscapes of African nations, China aims to strengthen its political and economic relationships across the continent, building on a growing network of similar facilities in other countries.</p>

          <p>A new court filing from legal watchdog groups alleges that children are being held for prolonged periods in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Dilley, Texas, under inhumane conditions. The report details accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation due to constantly lit rooms, and inadequate access to medical care and hygiene supplies. Families described the privately-run center as a "prison-like environment" where they face emotional distress and children suffer from a lack of proper education. These allegations suggest violations of the Flores settlement agreement, which sets minimum standards for the detention of immigrant children, and highlight the severe humanitarian concerns surrounding family detention policies.</p>

Critics draw parallels to the vendor financing patterns that contributed to the dot-com bubble, questioning the sustainability of an ecosystem where a company's capital expenditures become its partners' revenue. Despite an expected revenue of only $13 billion this year, OpenAI leadership defends the high costs as necessary for driving future AI breakthroughs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has achieved a remarkable public safety success by cutting the per-capita death rate from fires by approximately two-thirds since 1980. This significant progress is attributed to an accumulation of small but crucial improvements in fire safety technology and regulation. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, the increased installation of automatic sprinkler systems in new buildings, and the implementation of safer furnishing standards that make upholstery less flammable. Additionally, a major decline in cigarette smoking and the requirement for "fire-safe" cigarettes have drastically reduced the number of smoking-related home fires, collectively saving countless lives over the decades.</p>

Prosecutors are recommending at least four to five years, whereas Combs's defense team is arguing for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which would result in his near-immediate release due to time already served. The case revolves around Combs orchestrating and paying for travel for sexual encounters involving his girlfriends and male sex workers, which falls under the federal Mann Act.</p>

Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes and online transactions, while opponents maintain that it still poses a threat to individual privacy.

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe, discovered by a resident cleaning up debris after Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been preserved by Florida state archeologists. The 9-foot vessel is highly unusual as it is the first of its kind found in the state to be made of mahogany, suggesting it may have originated outside Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. While radiocarbon dating has so far been inconclusive, tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact. The discovery adds to Florida's vast collection of over 450 recorded ancient canoes, reinforcing the region's significance as a center for such archeological finds due to its water-rich environment, which aided both transportation and preservation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is poised for one of the largest mass resignations in its history, with over 100,000 federal workers set to quit as part of the Trump administration's deferred resignation program. This initiative is a key component of a broader effort to significantly reduce the federal workforce, which employees describe as a campaign of "fear and intimidation." Many who accepted the offer felt they had no choice due to the toxic work environment, job insecurity, and public vilification of civil servants. The mass exodus is expected to be the largest single-year decline in civilian federal employment since World War II, raising significant concerns about the operational capacity and stability of government agencies.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has claimed that the nation's new J-35 stealth fighter possesses superior low-observability features compared to its American counterpart, the F-35. A report on the state broadcaster CCTV stated that the J-35's radar cross-section is smaller than a human palm, attributing this to its unique airframe shape and proprietary metamaterial technology. For comparison, the F-35's radar cross-section is often described as being about the size of a golf ball. This announcement underscores the escalating technological competition between the United States and China as both nations continue to develop and field advanced fifth-generation military aircraft. The claim highlights China's growing confidence in its domestic defense industry and its capabilities.</p>

A pivotal event during the trip tilts the film's axis, powerfully capturing Sam's anger and disappointment when her father fails to protect her. The writer describes it as a moving and insightful coming-of-age story that resonates deeply, highlighting its deceptive simplicity and emotional depth.</p>

          <p>In a deeply personal essay for The Atlantic, an author recounts his experience using an AI chatbot to simulate conversations with his father, who died in a plane crash when the author was a child. By feeding the AI basic facts, he was able to generate a personality that felt eerily authentic, allowing him to explore decades of unresolved grief and ask questions that had long plagued him. The article reflects on the profound, comforting, and ultimately unsettling nature of this modern form of resurrection, drawing parallels to Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* and the human desire to conquer death. The experience highlights the complex emotional territory that AI is opening up, blurring the lines between memory, technology, and the grieving process.</p>

          <p>Food pantries across Maine are confronting a dual crisis of a severe volunteer shortage and the anticipation of significant federal funding cuts, threatening their ability to serve food-insecure communities. Many of these critical hunger relief agencies are run entirely by volunteers, a large portion of whom are elderly retirees, making the system highly vulnerable. The increasing demand for food assistance, coupled with a decline in available federal food supplies, is placing immense strain on this charitable network. The situation highlights the fragility of a system that has become an essential, yet overburdened, component of the social safety net, struggling to recruit younger volunteers who face their own economic pressures.</p>

          <p>England's recent victory in the Women's Rugby World Cup is the culmination of years of strategic investment and planning by the Rugby Football Union (RFU). The team's current dominance, which includes six straight Grand Slams and a 33-Test winning streak, is attributed to two key decisions made nearly a decade ago: the establishment of a professional domestic league and the introduction of full-time central contracts for players. These moves professionalized the sport, dramatically improving player welfare and performance, and creating a depth of talent that is unmatched globally. While costly, this long-term vision has paid off, transforming the Red Roses from a major force into the undisputed powerhouse of women's rugby.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, France, and Germany have reimposed sweeping UN sanctions on Iran, ten years after they were lifted as part of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers triggered the "snapback" mechanism, accusing Iran of "continued nuclear escalation" and a lack of cooperation with international inspectors after it suspended inspections following US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear sites. Iran's president called the sanctions "unjust and illegal" but insisted the country does not seek nuclear weapons. This move represents a major blow to the already fragile Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and signals a significant escalation of tensions between Iran and the West over its nuclear program.</p>

This research addresses the challenge of eliminating deeply buried and fortified military assets that may be invulnerable to even the most powerful conventional weapons.

Despite the ban, acitrón is still widely available in markets due to high demand from customers who consider it essential for authentic recipes.

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reported its best month ever for electric vehicle sales, selling over 10,600 units in August, a 19% increase compared to the same month last year.

The automaker has recently refreshed the Mach-E, cutting costs while adding new features, and is also seeing gains with its F-150 Lightning pickup. To further encourage adoption, Ford has been offering complimentary home chargers and installation, a unique incentive aimed at making the transition to electric ownership more convenient for customers.
