          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Bergen County, New Jersey, with tremors felt across the region, including parts of New York City. The United States Geological Survey reported the event was centered six miles below Hasbrouck Heights. While the shaking was noticed up to 60 miles away, there have been no reports of any damage or injuries resulting from the incident. The article also provides context on previous, more significant seismic events in the Tri-State area, including a 4.8 magnitude quake in the prior year.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic observers are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Some analysts suggest attendance could foster a tripartite meeting with Russia to help resolve ongoing China-India border disputes. However, most experts believe Modi is unlikely to participate, despite a recent thaw in relations between the two nations. The article frames the potential visit as a significant, though improbable, diplomatic gesture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This non-criminal probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's prosecutorial actions against Donald Trump were politically motivated to influence the 2024 election. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from engaging in certain political activities. Smith's team had previously maintained their investigations were not driven by politics.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Propose Drone Swarm Technology for Precision Electronic Warfare</h2>

          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a method for using drone swarms to create a protective "storm eye" for friendly forces during electronic warfare. The system works by precisely adjusting signals from multiple drones to jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating a null zone where friendly signals are unaffected. This targeted approach represents a significant advance over traditional omnidirectional jamming. The research suggests a new level of sophistication in China's electronic warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill stated in a BBC interview that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave medicine for a career in comedy. Hill, who qualified as a doctor, felt unsuited for the profession and realized he did not want to spend his life in a job he was not passionate about. He recalled feeling emotionally out of his depth when delivering bad news to patients. The experience of his stepfather's death gave him the push to pursue his dream, leading to a successful career in entertainment.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United Reportedly Open to Selling Striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30m</h2>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for around £30 million, despite his recent goal-scoring performance in a pre-season match. The potential sale is linked to the club's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While United sources state they can make a new signing without first selling players, an exit would likely be necessary to remain compliant with financial regulations. If Sesko were to arrive, Hojlund's role at the club would be marginalized, prompting the club to consider his departure.</p>

          <h2>Meta Signals More Cautious Approach to Open-Source AI Amid China's Rapid Advances</h2>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more careful with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, which some experts believe could help the country surpass the U.S. in the field. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba have recently released powerful new open-source models. The move suggests a potential strategic realignment in the global AI landscape as companies weigh the benefits of open collaboration against competitive and security concerns.</p>
