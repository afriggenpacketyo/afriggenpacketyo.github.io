          <p>The Japanese government has signaled some support for the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear sites, viewing them as a demonstration of Washington's commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the importance of de-escalating the situation and expressed Japan's hope for a renewed dialogue between the U.S. and Iran. Japan, heavily reliant on Middle Eastern crude oil, traditionally maintains amicable relations with Iran while also upholding its security alliance with the United States. The government is closely monitoring the conflict's impact on Japan's energy supply, especially considering Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping lane.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened tensions following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supplies. However, the final decision rests with the country's national security council. Experts suggest that closing the strait could alienate Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. Analysts believe Iran has little to gain and much to lose by disrupting oil flows through the strait, as it could provoke hostilities and damage its own economy. The article highlights the potential for higher energy prices and increased geopolitical instability if the strait is closed.</p>

          <p>A recent Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least five fatalities and several injuries, with emergency services working to rescue individuals trapped under the debris of a partially collapsed apartment building. The attack, which targeted residential areas, hospitals, and sports infrastructure, follows a previous bombardment that killed 28 people in Kyiv. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko expressed hope that the death toll would not rise further, while rescue operations continue at the affected site. The strikes occurred shortly after President Trump spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin about the Israeli strikes on Iran.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are expressing concerns that the rising uncertainty in the Middle East, fueled by U.S. strikes on Iran and Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, could negatively impact the global economy. A potential shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to higher crude prices, increased U.S. inflation, and complications for the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. While gold could benefit from geopolitical shocks, Chinese assets might remain relatively shielded. If Iran were to follow through with its threat, oil prices could potentially surge to the $100-$120 range, further exacerbating economic anxieties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to commit to increasing their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), driven by pressure from the U.S. and ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The 5% target includes 3.5% for pure defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, such as cyber warfare capabilities. While some member states are supportive, others are hesitant to meet the agreed-upon 2% threshold, raising questions about the feasibility of these pledges. The U.S. is seeking concrete plans and commitments from its allies, but disagreements persist regarding the allocation and accounting of defense spending.</p>

          <p>The NHS in Scotland is considering establishing ketamine clinics to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. A psychiatrist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital hopes to set up a clinic by the end of the year, providing patients with an additional treatment option.</p>

          <p>Global markets have largely remained stable despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, with investors viewing the conflict as contained. The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe havens like the Japanese yen and spot gold prices showed mixed performance. Analysts suggest that the market sees the attack on Iran as a relief, diminishing the nuclear threat in the region. While acknowledging the gravity of the situation, experts do not consider it a systemic risk to global markets.</p>

          <p>The article criticizes Western leaders' response to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, particularly the U.S. strikes on Iran, as being inadequate and hypocritical. It argues that these leaders are failing to address the root causes of the conflict and are prioritizing unconditional support for Israel over international law and human rights. The author contends that this approach is eroding the credibility and authority of Western governments, creating a growing disconnect between political elites and public opinion. The piece suggests that Western leaders are more focused on maintaining a failing world order than on promoting peace and justice.</p>

          <p>NATO's ambitious goals, including increased defense spending and troop deployments, are placing heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, achieving the target of spending 5% of GDP on defense is proving contentious. The German military also faces the challenge of recruiting additional soldiers to meet NATO's requirements, with discussions ongoing about potentially reinstating compulsory military service.

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing Europe's defense spending, a long-standing demand of U.S. President Donald Trump.

However, challenges remain, including securing unanimous support for the 3.5% target for core military spending and addressing concerns about Ukraine's NATO aspirations.
