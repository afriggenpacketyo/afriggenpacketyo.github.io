          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a new strain of bacteria, named niallia tiangongensis, on board the Tiangong space station. This variant of a previously known terrestrial bacteria exhibits enhanced abilities to combat oxidative stress and reverse radiation-induced damage. Understanding the survival mechanisms of this microbe could have implications for space technology, agriculture, and medicine, potentially leading to the development of targeted control strategies for microbes in various sectors. The researchers emphasized the importance of studying microbes during long-term space missions to protect astronaut health and spacecraft functionality.</p>

          <p>Legal experts and former judges are expressing concern over increasing verbal attacks and threats directed towards US judges who have ruled against the Trump administration's policies. These attacks, seemingly spurred by the president and his allies, are creating a hostile climate that endangers the safety of judges and their families. The concerns have heightened following reports of anonymous pizza deliveries to judges involved in cases concerning the administration, with some deliveries made in the name of a judge's son who was fatally shot in 2020. This has prompted calls for investigations and statements backing judicial independence.</p>

Jost's willingness to be the target of jokes from cast members like Sarah Sherman and Michael Che has allowed the show to address cultural anxieties and mock figures of authority. By playing the role of the establishment figure who is constantly challenged and ridiculed, Jost has created a unique and sympathetic persona that has resonated with audiences.

          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has reignited concerns about his physical and mental fitness. The recording captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, reinforcing Hur's description of him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The audio has prompted fresh recriminations among Democrats and recalls a period when calls for Biden to drop out of the race were prevalent. The article notes that the new debate recalls one of the Democratic Party’s most painful periods, when Mr. Biden and his allies struggled to right his re-election campaign amid calls by Democratic officials — both in private and in public — to drop out and name a successor.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine killed at least nine people on Saturday, targeting a shuttle bus carrying civilians. This deadly strike occurred hours after Ukrainian and Russian officials met face-to-face in Istanbul for the first time in over three years. The meeting resulted in an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners, but did not bring the two sides closer to ending the war. President Zelensky condemned the attack as a "deliberate attack on civilians," calling for stronger sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advocating for the use of coal to power AI data centers, aiming to revive the struggling coal industry. This initiative clashes with the tech industry's environmental goals, which prioritize renewable energy and nuclear power. While some acknowledge the need for fossil fuels in the short term, the tech sector is primarily focused on natural gas, which emits less carbon dioxide than coal. Experts suggest that Trump's executive order is a symbolic gesture to coal mining constituents, with limited prospects for long-term adoption by hyperscale tech companies.</p>

The downgrade reflects concerns about the failure of successive administrations to reverse the trend of large fiscal deficits.

Some 27,000 fewer Americans died of a drug overdose in 2024 than in 2023, the steepest single-year decline since record-keeping began 45 years ago. The biggest factors behind the decline include the growing availability of naloxone and the use of telehealth to access addiction treatment.

Aides have discussed declaring I.V.F. an “Essential Health Benefit” under the Affordable Care Act and pushing Congress to mandate private insurance coverage for infertility treatments. The White House has been consulting with fertility experts and conservative policy groups, though one leading medical society says it has been shut out of the process.
