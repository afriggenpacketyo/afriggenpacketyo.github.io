          <p>Two Chinese scientists propose that the "Star Manual of Master Shi," an ancient Chinese astronomical catalogue, predates the Greek Hipparchus star catalogue, potentially making it the world's oldest star log. The researchers used image processing to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming observations around 335 BC. If verified, this finding would rewrite the history of astronomy, crediting China with the earliest known systematic record of the stars.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has pledged to support its film industry following Donald Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US. Australia, known as "Hollywood Down Under," offers a 30% rebate for large-scale film projects. Industry figures express uncertainty about the impact of the proposed tariffs, which could affect both foreign productions in Australia and the export of Australian content to the US.

          <h2>Roses Were Likely Yellow, Not Red, According to New Study</h2>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the popular saying "roses are red." The study examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor probably had single-petal yellow flowers with seven leaflets. Roses are extensively cultivated and come in various colors and forms, but the ancestral trait reconstruction points to a yellow origin for the flower that is now widely seen as a symbol of love and beauty.</p>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, and has developed a strong edge in commercializing and manufacturing tech. They note that Chinese AI models are becoming competitive with US versions, and that China's open-source approach and widespread adoption of technology pose a significant challenge to American dominance. The authors suggest that the US needs to openly share more AI technologies, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout its economy to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>As high tariffs reduce U.S. orders for Chinese goods, China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market, a move that threatens to drive the country into deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting this effort, with e-commerce giants like JD.com and Tencent promoting sales of these goods to Chinese consumers. An influx of discounted goods intended for the U.S. market could erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment, contributing to weak consumer demand.</p>
