          <p>The Las Vegas Raiders selected TCU wide receiver Jack Bech in the NFL Draft, marking an emotional moment as it came shortly after his brother's death in a New Orleans terror attack. Jack's brother, Tiger, was a Princeton football player and finance professional. Jack dedicated his Senior Bowl performance to his brother, expressing the surreal experience of achieving his goal while grieving. He caught 62 passes for 1,034 yards last season and will join Jakobi Meyers and Tre Tucker in the Raiders' receiving corps.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Japanese research team has found that a one-minute exposure to a 100 hertz sound can potentially prevent motion sickness by stimulating the inner ear and improving balance. The study involved exposing volunteers to the sound before simulated and real car rides, with 70-80% experiencing alleviated symptoms like lightheadedness and nausea. Researchers believe the sound activates the vestibular system by stimulating the otolithic organs. This discovery offers a potential alternative to medication for motion sickness prevention, especially relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles.</p>

Bessent responded, dismissing the letter as a campaign waged from behind a keyboard and affirming his commitment to serving in the Trump administration. He argued that the American people elected President Trump and that being part of the administration is the honor of his lifetime.</p>

While large corporations have received tariff exemptions, small businesses struggle to absorb price shocks and navigate complex supply chains.

          <p>China is taking a tougher stance towards President Donald Trump's second term, responding to his tariffs with countermeasures and asserting its position on the global stage. Unlike Trump's first term, there is no apparent prospect of a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. China has become more vocal in its criticism of American policies, rallying international support for its stance and reaching out to US allies. This shift may reflect a hardening of attitudes resulting from experiences during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is restoring visas for hundreds of foreign students who had their legal status abruptly terminated, reversing an earlier decision that caused widespread panic. The announcement follows more than 100 lawsuits filed by students who were stripped of their legal right to study in US universities. Justice department attorney Elizabeth Kurlan told a federal court that immigration officials are now working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students.</p>

          <h2>California Proposes Testing of Driverless Heavy-Duty Trucks</h2>

          <p>California regulators have released a proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads. The proposed regulations are subject to a public comment period and will likely face pushback from safety advocates and labor unions. The California legislature passed a bill in 2023 to require human drivers aboard self-driving semi-trailer trucks, but it was vetoed by governor Gavin Newsom. The proposed regulations aim to enhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers and give the DMV more authority to apply enforcement measures.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new analysis from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year. The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.</p>
