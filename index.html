          <h2>Jeremy Corbyn Discusses Formation of New Left-Wing Political Party</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:26:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jeremy Corbyn confirmed ongoing discussions to form a new left-wing political party following former Labour MP Zarah Sultana's departure to co-lead it. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and expressed excitement about building a "real alternative" to the current two-party system. The initiative aims to transform a small group of independent pro-Gaza MPs into a formal political entity, potentially contesting local elections next year. This development reflects a growing appetite for a new political direction in the UK, challenging the traditional two-party dominance and offering a different vision for the country's future, as some Labour MPs feel the party has "left them."</p>

          <h2>Iran Regime Intensifies Repression, Moves Towards Isolation Model</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:25:13 EDT</div>

          <p>Following the recent conflict with Israel, the Iranian regime is escalating domestic repression, moving towards a "North Korea-style model of isolation and control." Citizens face arbitrary stops, phone searches, and arrests for content deemed pro-Israel or mocking the regime, while a total internet blackout was imposed during the war to control information. Experts like Kasra Aarabi and Dr. Afshon Ostovar believe this unprecedented crackdown is a sign of the regime's weakness and a desperate strategy for survival, indicating an internal crisis within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with potential purges.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have detected 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, identified as a comet approximately 670 million kilometers from the sun. While much remains unknown about its precise origin and composition, current projections indicate it poses no danger to Earth, passing by at about 240 million km in October. Scientists continue to monitor its trajectory and activity, with new telescopes like the Vera Rubins expected to detect several more such objects over the next decade. The European Space Agency is also developing a "Comet Interceptor" spacecraft, scheduled for launch in 2029, to intercept distant comets and asteroids.</p>

          <p>A major explosion at a Rome petrol station in the Prenestino neighborhood injured at least 29 people, including nine police officers and two suffering severe burns. The incident occurred after a tanker truck hit a pipe, causing an initial gas leak and a smaller blast, followed by a larger explosion from a fire. The impact caused widespread devastation, burnt vehicles, and rattled buildings across the city, prompting evacuations of nearby structures like a sports center. Rome's mayor described the impact as "terrible" and credited swift evacuations with preventing a "much more serious tragedy."</p>

Critics, including opposition politicians and LGBTQ+ advocates, condemned the decision as "unedifying gender baiting" and censorship, arguing it sends a message to young people that they are "not safe and they're not welcome if they're LGBT or trans," potentially harming their mental health.</p>

          <p>When considering hiring professional movers, financial experts suggest evaluating four key questions to determine if the cost is justified. These include assessing the value of items that would be expensive to replace, calculating whether the cost is worth the time saved, considering the benefit to one's peace of mind and stress levels, and ensuring that outsourcing the move does not jeopardize long-term financial goals. The average cost for a local two-to-three-bedroom move is $1,250, while a long-distance move can average $4,890. (not investment advice)</p>

Similarly, Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson's biography of designer Claire McCardell highlights fashion that prioritizes practicality and comfort, seeing women as "doers" rather than just subjects of appearance.

          <p>The article compiles a list of five "feel-good" TV shows recommended by Atlantic writers and editors for unwinding after a hard day. These include "Bones," praised as an uplifting love letter to public service and scientific knowledge despite its copaganda elements; the absurd and culinary-focused "Hannibal"; Season 3 of "The Office," which marked a shift towards more comfort and less cringe; the "evergreen and endearingly of its time" mockumentary "Parks and Recreation"; and the deeply satisfying sketch comedy "Portlandia." Each show offers a unique blend of humor, comfort, or underlying positive themes.</p>

          <h2>'Jurassic World Rebirth' Deemed Pointless Sequel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, "Jurassic World Rebirth," is criticized as a "plodding, disenchanting experience" with little reason to exist beyond generating box office revenue. Despite director Gareth Edwards' impressive sense of scale and clean action, the article argues the film lacks memorable characters, narrative stakes, and the original series' sense of wonder. The plot, a mashup of previous sequels, sees dinosaurs relegated to a remote island, becoming more of an "everyday nuisance" rather than awe-inspiring creatures. This leads to a pervasive sense of boredom among the ensemble cast, failing to reignite excitement for the franchise.</p>

Their connection blossomed through shared experiences like driving a yacht and a California road trip, where she felt respected and at ease.

          <p>The European Union and the United States are nearing a critical July 9 deadline for trade talks, with the potential for US tariffs on EU goods to surge to 50% if no deal is reached. While a comprehensive agreement within 90 days was deemed "impossible" by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, an "agreement in principle" is sought, possibly modeled after the US-UK deal. Divisions persist among EU member states regarding concessions, and experts suggest the EU might accept a 10% baseline tariff to avoid steeper duties, though uncertainty will likely remain.

          <p>Kyiv endured its largest aerial assault since the war began over three years ago, with Russia launching 550 drones and missiles overnight, injuring at least 23 people and causing severe damage. This intensified attack occurred on the same day President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, prompting Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to call the timing a deliberate signal of Moscow's intent to continue the war. Trump expressed disappointment with the call, while the US has paused some military aid to Ukraine due to concerns about its own stockpiles.</p>

          <p>Large parts of the Czech Republic experienced a major power blackout on Friday, confirmed by grid operator CEPS, affecting areas including the capital, Prague, and halting train lines in five districts.

Police stated there was no information suggesting a cyber or terror attack, distinguishing this incident from past blackout fears in Europe.

          <p>The article explores how the American Revolutionary War, under General George Washington, laid the foundations for a national American identity among diverse and often provincial colonists. Initially viewing his troops as "dirty & nasty people," Washington came to respect their sacrifice, fostering unity through shared suffering and new traditions like celebrating his birthday and adopting a unifying flag. The war's veterans, many becoming Federalists, later championed a strong central government, believing it essential for the nation's future. This historical account highlights the messy, ongoing process of defining what it means to be American.</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on re-reading Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own" and finding its continued relevance to modern feminism, despite initial skepticism. The author, a working-class Latina, initially felt alienated by what seemed like a privileged white feminist discourse but now appreciates Woolf's insights on women's need for personal space and financial independence to create art. The article draws parallels between Woolf's observations on societal limitations and contemporary issues of economic disparity, stereotypes in storytelling, and the scarcity of time for women, highlighting the ongoing struggle for equity.</p>

          <p>One year after its landslide victory, Britain's Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, faces a tougher-than-expected path, with his popularity plummeting due to unfulfilled economic promises. Despite stronger-than-expected Q1 growth, economists anticipate a worsening outlook, partly due to potential US tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces difficult decisions on public finances, with rising prospects of new tax hikes. While the government achieved "historic" trade deals, including with the US and EU, these have not yet boosted Labour's ratings, and the rise of rival Reform UK signals public disaffection.
