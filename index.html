          <p>Health authorities in the UK have issued amber and yellow heat alerts across most of England as the country prepares for a second major heatwave. Temperatures are expected to climb into the 30s Celsius, potentially setting a new record for the hottest start to the Wimbledon tennis championship. The heatwave, attributed to several factors including hot air from the US and high pressure over England, is expected to last four to six days. This event highlights the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves, which scientists link to climate change.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has announced plans to scrap 201 organizations that oversee and run parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The move, part of a new 10-year health strategy, aims to simplify the system and redirect resources to frontline care by having "more doers and fewer checkers." Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. Critics have expressed concern that the vital functions of these organizations must be preserved within the new structure.</p>

          <p>Utility workers excavating in Lima, Peru, have discovered a well-preserved, 1,000-year-old mummy. The remains, believed to be of a woman from the pre-Inca Chancay culture, were found just 20 inches underground and remarkably still had intact dark brown hair. Archaeologists note that such discoveries are common in Lima, which is home to hundreds of archaeological sites, due to the region's dry desert climate that naturally mummifies remains. This finding offers another glimpse into the ancient civilizations that inhabited the area long before the Spanish colonization.</p>

          <p>A chief economist at China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins. The reasoning is that the country's mature third-party payment platforms, like WeChat and Alipay, already function similarly to stablecoins and are supported by a well-established regulatory framework. According to the research note, this existing infrastructure, which pegs digital money to fiat currency with strong safeguards, positions China favorably. The analysis suggests policymakers should leverage this existing strength as digital currencies become more prominent globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Traditional Japanese Diet May Lower Depression Risk</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and green tea. The findings indicate a potential link between these dietary patterns and improved mental well-being. This is the first study of its kind to specifically examine the mental health benefits associated with this traditional style of eating.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is scheduled to visit the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in July. During his visit, he is expected to tour memorial museums and other sites related to the 1945 atomic bombings. The itinerary may also include meetings with hibakusha, the survivors of the atomic bomb attacks. This visit from the head of the prestigious peace prize committee underscores the continued global significance of nuclear disarmament and remembrance of the bombings' devastating impact.</p>

          <p>Four giant pandas on loan to the Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama, Japan, have been sent back to China as their lease agreement expires. The pandasâ€”a 24-year-old female named Rauhin and her three offspringâ€”were transported to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan. The return is a standard part of China's "panda diplomacy," where the animals are loaned to zoos around the world for a set period.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan. The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel, effective June 2027. This measure aims to protect endangered eel populations, which have been under severe pressure globally. The decision will be considered at an upcoming conference, setting up a potential conflict between conservation efforts and commercial fishing interests.</p>

          <p>The residents of Littlebredy, a village of 32 homes in Dorset, are facing eviction after the Bridehead Estate was sold for approximately Â£30 million to an anonymous owner. The new owner, registered as a limited company linked to a private equity firm, has reportedly ordered residents to leave and has terminated public access to the estate grounds. The situation has left the community with a profound sense of powerlessness and highlights the precariousness of rural life. The event has sparked a planned protest to draw attention to feudal-like land ownership power in England.</p>

          <p>With a record heat wave sweeping across the United States, child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the danger of heatstroke for children left in vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died in hot cars, with experts noting that a vehicle's interior can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes. Officials emphasize that distraction is a common factor and urge parents and caregivers to create routines to prevent such tragedies. They recommend placing a personal item in the backseat as a reminder and calling 911 immediately if a child is seen alone in a car.</p>

In the trial, a stent electrode was inserted into the brain's vasculature of a paralyzed patient, who was then able to regain some limb movement.
