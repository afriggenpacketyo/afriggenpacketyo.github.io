          <p>A recent Quinnipiac University poll reveals that a significant majority of football fans in Pennsylvania, 72%, believe the Philadelphia Eagles' controversial "tush push" play should remain legal in the NFL. Support is even stronger among Eagles fans specifically, with 81% in favor of the highly effective maneuver, which the team has used to great success over the past few seasons. Despite efforts by other NFL teams to have the play banned during the offseason, it was not outlawed. The poll reflects a local sentiment that the play's effectiveness is not a valid reason to prohibit it from the game.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have reported that two victims of the recent terrorist attack at a synagogue, one of whom was killed, appear to have been hit by police gunfire. This conclusion was reached after determining the attacker, who was fatally shot by officers, did not possess a firearm. The tragic incident unfolded as law enforcement confronted the assailant while worshippers bravely barricaded themselves inside the building. The two victims killed in the attack were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, with Daulby's family calling him a hero for his actions.</p>

          <p>A terror attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Manchester resulted in the deaths of two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, and left three others seriously injured. The suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie, used a vehicle to ram into people before attempting to enter the synagogue with a blade on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism. Worshippers successfully barricaded the doors, preventing further tragedy inside before police arrived and fatally shot the attacker. The incident has been widely condemned, prompting increased security measures for Jewish communities across the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. military conducted a strike in international waters off the coast of Venezuela, destroying a small boat and killing four individuals described as "narco-terrorists." The operation was justified by intelligence indicating the vessel was trafficking a substantial amount of narcotics toward the United States. This action follows President Trump's recent declaration classifying drug cartels as unlawful combatants, signaling an escalation in U.S. operations against them. The Venezuelan government has condemned recent U.S. military activities in the region as a provocation that threatens its national sovereignty.</p>

The impasse centers on Democrats' demands to extend expiring health insurance tax credits and reverse cuts to Medicaid, which Republicans have so far rejected. As a result, approximately 40% of the federal workforce, around 750,000 employees, are expected to be placed on unpaid leave. While essential services like border protection and air traffic control will continue, many other functions, including national parks and research projects, face significant disruptions.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, both Google and Apple have removed apps from their online stores that allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Apple removed the app ICEBlock after Attorney General Pam Bondi directly requested its removal, citing safety risks to law enforcement. The move came after authorities noted that a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility had searched for such apps. Google confirmed it had also removed similar apps for policy violations, though it was not directly contacted by the Department of Justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When contacted by a debt collector, it is crucial to take several steps before making any payment to protect your financial interests. First, you must validate the debt by requesting written proof that it is yours and that the collector has the legal right to pursue it. Second, you should weigh your options, which may include negotiating a smaller lump-sum settlement or arranging a payment plan. Finally, it is essential to get any agreement in writing before sending money to prevent future disputes and ensure the account is reported correctly to credit bureaus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a U.S.-backed peace plan for Gaza, warning that "all hell" will break out if the agreement is not reached. The 20-point proposal includes an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. While some of Hamas's political leadership are reportedly open to the plan with adjustments, mediators have indicated that the group's military wing in Gaza is likely to reject it, creating a significant obstacle to moving forward.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues without a clear resolution, voters from across the political spectrum are expressing their concerns and frustrations. A Republican voter from California worried about the economic impact on everyday Americans, while a Maryland Democrat, though nervous, viewed the fight over healthcare subsidies as necessary. Others expressed concern that the Democratic party lacks a clear strategy and is losing the public relations battle. The sentiment reflects a widespread belief that ordinary citizens are caught in the middle of a political stalemate with no good outcome in sight.</p>

While the company is showing signs of a turnaround, its business in the Chinese market has been described as "awful." Analysts suggest that if Hill can provide any indication of a recovery in China during an upcoming interview, it could cause a significant rise in the company's stock price.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is centered on a dispute over extending enhanced premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which help 22 million Americans afford health insurance. These subsidies, which have nearly doubled ACA marketplace enrollment since 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025. If Congress fails to extend them, the average premium for an ACA enrollee could more than double, and an estimated 4 million people could lose their insurance coverage. Democrats are demanding the extension as a condition for passing a government funding bill.</p>

          <p>Internal government data reveals that nearly 40% of the more than 3,500 arrests made during the Trump administration's federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., were for civil immigration violations. While the operation was publicly framed as an effort to combat violent crime, the statistics show that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made almost 1,400 administrative arrests of individuals sought for deportation. The remaining arrests were for criminal offenses, including homicide, narcotics, and firearms charges. The data highlights a significant focus on immigration enforcement within the broader crime crackdown.</p>

          <p>This opinion article raises concerns about President Trump's increasing use of the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement, arguing it blurs the line between military and civilian authority in violation of U.S. law. The author points to the deployment of troops to the southern border and major cities, as well as the president's recent suggestion to use cities as "training grounds for our military." The piece questions when military leaders will push back against what it describes as an effort to reshape the armed forces into a partisan tool, noting the recent dismissal of several high-ranking officials.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl named Lydia Kaiser, who sustained a traumatic brain injury after being shot in the head during a mass shooting at her Minneapolis school, has returned to class.

Lydia was shot while reportedly shielding a younger student and required surgery to relieve swelling in her brain. Her family has since met with public officials to advocate for action against gun violence, stating that "thoughts and prayers haven't been enough."</p>
