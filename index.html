          <p>Authorities in Jamaica Beach, Texas, discovered multiple packages of cocaine along the shoreline, suspecting they were dumped overboard from a ship during a raid. The packages, labeled "7-P," were found tangled in algae. This incident follows a pattern of illicit drugs washing up on U.S. beaches, particularly in the Florida Keys and Alabama. Researchers estimate that about 90% of the cocaine consumed in North America originates from Colombia, often smuggled via speed boats and semi-submersible vessels, with packages sometimes dumped to evade law enforcement. Anyone spotting further packages should contact the Jamaica Beach Police Department.</p>

          <p>Gold prices initially surged to a record high following President Trump's renewed attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which spooked investors and shook confidence in the U.S. However, prices later retreated as the stock market rallied on hopes of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting a potential de-escalation. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, and central banks have been increasing their gold reserves, further supporting its value. Analysts suggest that gold will continue to serve as an effective hedge amid ongoing trade uncertainty, seeing further upside potential due to investment demand, central bank diversification, and a volatile macro backdrop.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's repeated criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has sparked concerns about the Fed's independence, with some economists suggesting that simply firing Powell might not be enough to achieve Trump's desired rate cuts. Experts argue that to truly bend monetary policy, Trump would likely need to replace the entire Fed Board, potentially triggering a severe market backlash. Concerns are rising that such actions could undermine investor confidence, leading to sell-offs and fears of higher inflation, especially given existing pressures from tariffs and elevated inflation expectations. The Supreme Court is set to hear an appeal about Trump's firing of board members at other federal organizations in a case that could shed light on what's next for the Fed.</p>

          <p>Amid recent market turbulence triggered by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and ongoing tariff uncertainties, Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett advises investors to adopt a contrarian approach. Buffett's "simple rule" dictates being fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful, suggesting that downturns can present opportunities for long-term investors. Experts caution that the administration's unpredictable economic policies could lead to continued market volatility, making it challenging to discern a clear direction. Buffett's strategy emphasizes a long-term perspective, encouraging investors to remain steadfast and take advantage of market dips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is sounding the alarm about the political roots of global financial instability, warning that President Trump's "America first" agenda could trigger a $1 trillion hit to global output. The IMF's report highlights the danger in Trump's trade policies and pressure on the Federal Reserve, cautioning that hedge funds' sour bets could deepen chaos in bond markets. The report draws a comparison with the "dash for cash" during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the Federal Reserve rescued US treasury markets, noting developing nations may face increased debt to cushion the blow from Trump's tariffs. The IMF's concerns reflect a broader anxiety about the politicization of the monetary-fiscal nexus under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Private student loans can be a valuable tool to bridge the gap between federal aid and total college expenses, covering costs like books, housing, and transportation. While they may not offer the same safeguards as federal loans, private loans often provide higher borrowing limits, flexible repayment options, and simpler application processes. Experts recommend exploring scholarships, grants, and federal loans first before considering private options. Key factors to consider when choosing a private student loan include interest rates, borrowing limits, repayment flexibility, and associated fees, ensuring the loan aligns with your specific financial circumstances.

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order targeting a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act that allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices, proposing a change favored by the pharmaceutical industry. The order seeks to eliminate the discrepancy between small-molecule drugs and biologics, which currently have different timelines for price negotiation eligibility. Critics argue that this change could lead to increased Medicare spending, higher medication prices, and steeper premiums in Medicare Part D plans. While the order contains proposals opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, such as opening a pathway for more drug imports from Canada, analysts remain cautious about the administration's future moves regarding biopharma.</p>

          <p>Bill Owens, the executive producer of "60 Minutes," has resigned amidst efforts by Paramount Global to settle a $20 billion lawsuit filed by President Trump. The lawsuit concerns the network’s October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump claims was deceptively edited to favor Harris. Owens' departure could signal an impending settlement, as Paramount Global executives view the suit as an obstacle to the company's merger agreement with Skydance Media. Owens, a 37-year veteran of CBS News, stated that he would not be allowed to run the show as he always had, making independent decisions based on what’s right for the audience.</p>

Comer claims that the Biden administration ignored a previous referral and requests the Attorney General to review the case. Cuomo's spokesman dismissed the referral as a "meritless press release," accusing Comer of election interference.

Tesla's stock has been under pressure, partly due to concerns about Musk's controversial political activities, which have led to protests.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that President Trump's tariffs are significantly slowing global economic growth, projecting a reduction in the 2025 forecast to 2.8%. The IMF also indicated zero growth for the German economy in 2025 and noted that global financial stability risks have increased due to tighter financial conditions and heightened economic uncertainty. The IMF expects less-developed nations to fare worse, projecting a shrinkage of Mexico's economy, a projection which the Mexican president rejected. The IMF projects growth would slow to 0.8% in the Euro area in 2025, and to 1.2% in 2026.</p>

          <p>A $110 million penthouse has been listed in Manhattan, becoming the most expensive home for sale in New York City, amidst turbulent market conditions. The property, a quadplex atop the Steinway Tower, is being marketed as a rare bundled offering, featuring 11,480 square feet with panoramic views. Despite the market's volatility, the listing agent reports strong buyer interest, citing that the ultra-prime residential real estate market remains untouched by market fluctuations. The listing comes as high-end home sales have seen record activity in recent years, though some brokers note increased hesitation among luxury buyers due to economic uncertainty.</p>

Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring' serves as a blueprint for reporting on ecological disasters, while John Vaillant's 'Fire Weather' connects resource extraction to megafires. Sheri Fink's 'Five Days at Memorial' explores human responses to desperate situations during Hurricane Katrina. Ben Goldfarb's 'Crossings' examines the ecological impact of roads, and Joe Sacco's 'Paying the Land' illustrates the social fracturing caused by long-term fuel mining. Amitav Ghosh's 'The Great Derangement' discusses how storytelling fails to grasp the enormity of climate change, and Porter Fox's 'Category Five' underscores the underinvestment in oceanographic research.</p>

The resignations follow a series of events stemming from a request to dismiss charges against Adams, with several DOJ officials refusing to sign off on the dismissal.
