          <p>President Trump announced "great progress" in tariff talks with China held in Switzerland, suggesting a "total reset" in a social media post.

The article highlights the high stakes of these negotiations, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. The talks occur amidst concerns over tariffs imposed by both countries, impacting world financial markets and businesses reliant on US-China trade.</p>
