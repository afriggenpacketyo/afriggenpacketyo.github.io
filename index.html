        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated surprisingly strong growth in the second quarter, expanding at a 3% annualized rate despite the implementation of President Trump's tariffs. This expansion, which reversed a first-quarter contraction, was significantly boosted by a sharp drop in imports, which are subtracted in GDP calculations. A rebound in consumer spending also contributed to the sturdy economic performance, suggesting the economy has so far avoided a significant downturn. The data was released just before a Federal Reserve meeting, with most investors expecting interest rates to remain unchanged. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German sportswear company Adidas announced that U.S. tariffs could result in costs of up to 200 million euros in the second half of the year, forcing it to raise prices on its products in the American market. The company's CEO, Bjørn Gulden, stated that any price increases would be confined to the U.S. and implemented cautiously. The news caused Adidas shares to fall by over 7%, as investors reacted to the financial impact and broader risks to consumer demand if tariffs lead to inflation. The company maintained its full-year guidance but noted significant uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Palo Alto Networks' CEO, Nikesh Arora, stated that the acquisition aligns with the company's strategy of entering security categories at their market inflection point, which he believes is the current state for Identity Security.

          <p>President Donald Trump has confirmed that the August 1st deadline for implementing a new round of tariffs on numerous countries will not be extended. This announcement follows a previous 90-day delay on higher tariff rates that were initially set to begin in July. The administration has sent letters to over two dozen world leaders detailing the new import tax rates their countries will face, with some rates being significantly higher than previously proposed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the tariffs could be temporary if countries negotiate in good faith with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, exceeding forecasts and reversing a first-quarter contraction. This growth was largely driven by a significant decrease in imports, which are subtracted from the GDP calculation, and a rebound in consumer spending. The data comes as the Federal Reserve weighs its interest rate policy, with the strong growth potentially easing pressure for rate cuts. The report suggests resilience in the economy despite ongoing concerns about tariffs and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are explaining why the recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast did not produce a catastrophic tsunami on the scale of past events like the 2011 Japan quake. Although powerful, the energy released was significantly less than that of a magnitude 9.1 quake, which is about three times stronger. Oceanographer Simon Boxall noted the event was a result of the seabed flipping up along the Pacific Ring of Fire, which creates a tsunami. Experts emphasized that while the resulting waves caused coastal flooding and damage, they were not large enough to cause mass devastation.</p>

          <h2>Independent Medical Groups to Issue Vaccine Guidance Amidst Shifting Federal Policies</h2>

          <p>Several major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are creating their own vaccine recommendations for the public. This move comes in response to recent changes and perceived politicization of guidance from federal agencies like the CDC under the Trump administration. The groups aim to provide clear, evidence-based information on vaccines for COVID, flu, and RSV to counter what they describe as an "information crisis." The effort, known as the Vaccine Integrity Project, seeks to fill a void left by shifting federal policies and maintain public trust in immunizations.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Robert Reich argues that American democracy is being threatened by the silencing of media outlets and academic institutions critical of the Trump administration. He cites the departure of columnist Eduardo Porter from The Washington Post and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show on CBS as examples of corporate leaders yielding to political pressure to protect their business interests. Reich contends that this trend of self-censorship out of fear of retaliation is a dangerous path toward despotism. He calls for media and universities to resist such pressures to safeguard free expression.</p>

          <p>Recent volatile trading in stocks like Kohl's and Krispy Kreme marks the latest iteration of the meme stock phenomenon, driven by retail traders rather than company fundamentals. These stocks often share key characteristics: they are typically inexpensive and widely recognized household names, making it easier to generate broad interest. Furthermore, they are often heavily shorted, meaning many investors are betting against them. This creates an opportunity for coordinated buying campaigns on online forums to trigger a "short squeeze," where rising prices force short-sellers to buy back shares, further inflating the stock value.</p>

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged that Russia's economy has been operating under significant restrictions for a long time. He confirmed that Moscow continues to monitor all statements from President Trump and other international representatives on the matter.</p>

As part of the agreement, the EU has reportedly committed to purchasing $750 billion in strategic commodities like gas, oil, and AI chips from the U.S., as well as American military equipment.

This article traces the history of political attacks on the programs, from Ronald Reagan's criticisms of "socialized medicine" to modern proposals for block grants.
