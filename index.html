          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reaffirmed his government's plan to seize Gaza City, which involves displacing the civilian population. The plan has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from European allies and the United Nations, who warn of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe. Domestically, the move is opposed by tens of thousands of protesters and the families of hostages, who fear it jeopardizes the lives of those still held captive by Hamas. Netanyahu dismissed these concerns, asserting the strategy is the fastest way to conclude the war and dismantle the militant group.</p>

          <p>A significant wildfire has been burning on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy, forcing the closure of all hiking trails in the popular national park. Italian firefighters, supported by the army and six Canadair planes, are battling the blaze which has consumed over 1,200 acres of vegetation. The smoke is visible from the nearby ancient city of Pompeii, though the archaeological site remains open to visitors. This event is part of a broader trend of severe wildfires across Europe, fueled by record heat linked to climate change, with similar emergencies occurring in Spain and France.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that the next Federal Reserve chair must be someone capable of examining the entire organization, noting the Fed's mission has expanded beyond traditional monetary policy. In an interview, Bessent emphasized the need for a leader who has market confidence, can analyze complex data, and is forward-thinking rather than reliant on historical data. This comes as Bessent is reportedly leading the search for a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The comments highlight a desire for strategic reform within the central bank to address its evolving role. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President J.D. Vance confirmed that President Donald Trump is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a punitive measure for China's continued purchase of Russian oil. While no final decision has been made, the move would represent an escalation of economic pressure intended to indirectly impact Russia's war in Ukraine. Vance acknowledged the complexity of the issue, given the extensive economic relationship between the U.S. and China. The potential action would fall under an executive order that grants broad authority to penalize countries importing oil from the Russian Federation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued a formal apology after a shoe he designed in collaboration with Adidas Originals sparked accusations of cultural appropriation. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was inspired by traditional huarache sandals from Mexico but was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous Oaxacan communities that originated the design. The controversy drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, prompting Adidas to also apologize and engage in discussions about restitution. The brand has since removed promotional images of the footwear from its social media platforms.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation from the occupied West Bank reveals that ultra-nationalist Israeli settlers have significantly intensified their efforts to drive out Palestinian communities since the Hamas attacks of October 2023. The report profiles settler leaders who, emboldened by support from far-right members of Israel's government, are expanding settlements and seizing land, believing it is their divine right. This pressure, which includes violence and intimidation, has led to a sharp increase in what the UN describes as a systemic pattern of human rights violations.

          <p>Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenues from specific chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses for semiconductors like Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which are tailored for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration has not yet decided how the collected funds will be used. This novel policy underscores the administration's strategy of controlling advanced technology exports to China while creating a revenue stream from permitted sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The man who opened fire at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying himself, has been identified as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old who had become fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. According to a law enforcement official, White's father reported that his son blamed the vaccine for causing him depression and suicidal thoughts. White was armed with five guns and attempted to enter the CDC campus before being stopped by guards and opening fire from across the street. The incident has prompted a CDC workers' union to demand federal condemnation of vaccine misinformation.</p>

          <p>A violent shooting at a nightclub in the Santa Lucía area of Ecuador's Guayas province has left eight people dead and three others injured. Authorities reported that heavily armed suspects arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles before opening fire on the patrons. This attack is the latest in a wave of extreme violence plaguing the coastal regions of the country, which are under a state of emergency. Officials attribute the surge in crime to disputes between organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels, with thousands of homicides recorded this year alone.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers across the state are still suffering from preventable heat-related illnesses and deaths. Advocates and some lawmakers point to a lack of effective enforcement by Cal/OSHA, an issue highlighted by a recent state audit that found the agency's inspectors often failed to take appropriate action. Many farmworkers, a large number of whom are undocumented, are hesitant to report unsafe conditions for fear of retaliation. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, the risks for this vulnerable workforce are escalating.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched through central London on Sunday to demand the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and to show support for Israel. The protest, led by figures including the UK's chief rabbi, featured Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages. Many attendees also expressed anger at the UK government's conditional intention to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas." The march was largely peaceful, though the Metropolitan Police reported three arrests related to minor scuffles and a public order offense.</p>

          <p>"Dawson's Creek" actor James van der Beek, 48, has revealed that the first warning sign of his stage 3 colorectal cancer was a subtle change in his bowel movements, a symptom he initially dismissed. The actor, who was diagnosed in 2024, emphasized that he otherwise felt healthy and had no glaring red flags, highlighting the importance of screening. Medical experts confirm that changes in bowel habits are a key indicator, along with symptoms like fatigue and blood in the stool. His experience underscores the recommendation for colorectal cancer screening to begin at age 45, as early detection is critical.</p>

The union stated the attack "compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured."

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened that the political fight over a contentious redistricting plan could "literally last years," as Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to block the Republican-led effort. The plan, which aims to give Republicans five additional U.S. House seats, prompted over 50 Democrats to leave Texas to deny the legislature a quorum. Abbott vowed to call continuous 30-day special sessions and have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return. The high-stakes standoff reflects a national battle over gerrymandering, with Democrats in other states threatening their own countermeasures.</p>

The silence, held in memory of former player Diogo Jota's late brother, was cut short after shouts were heard from the Palace supporters' end. Slot suggested an unaware fan may have started cheering, leading other Palace fans to try and quiet them, which inadvertently created more noise. He described the incident as unlucky rather than malicious, noting the widespread respect shown to the family.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is experiencing significant internal conflict regarding its standards for approving new drugs, particularly for rare diseases. The case of Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy exemplifies this dilemma.

However, after three patient deaths and a subsequent suspension of the drug, the initial decision is under scrutiny, highlighting the intense pressure on the FDA to balance rapid access to treatments with rigorous safety standards.
