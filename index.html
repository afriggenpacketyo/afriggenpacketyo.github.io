          <p>Target exceeded Wall Street's earnings and sales expectations for the fiscal second quarter, yet its shares tumbled about 10% in premarket trading. This decline followed an announcement that Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke would become the new CEO in February, succeeding Brian Cornell. The retailer experienced a drop in customer transactions and average spending, alongside stagnant annual sales, although digital sales were a bright spot. Fiddelke outlined priorities to reestablish Target's reputation for unique items, provide consistent customer experience, and leverage technology for efficiency, signaling a strategic shift to recapture growth.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm but continues to threaten the U.S. East Coast with dangerous surf and rip currents. While not expected to make direct landfall, coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are warned of significant flooding, leading to evacuation orders. The National Hurricane Center advises against swimming at most East Coast beaches, as the large storm is forecast to retain hurricane strength for several days, creating hazardous ocean conditions.

The partnership aims to bolster Hertz's profitability and digital retail presence, aligning with CEO Gil West's "Back-to-Basics Roadmap" turnaround plan after the company's 2020 bankruptcy and a failed EV strategy.

Most mobilized troops will be active-duty personnel, with some already operating in Zeitoun and Jabalia. This significant escalation is expected to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate south, prompting strong condemnation from international allies and warnings from the UN about a "horrific humanitarian impact." Regional mediators are simultaneously pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Nice, France, have launched an investigation into the death of Raphael Graven, also known as "Jean Pormanove," who died during a livestream that reportedly depicted his mistreatment by two other individuals.

French government minister Clara Chappaz condemned the "absolute horror" of the incident, referring it to media regulators and stressing the urgent need for online platforms to take responsibility for the dissemination of illicit content and ensure user safety.</p>

          <p>Cured meats and sausages, commonly found in supermarkets, often contain nitrite curing salt (sodium nitrite, E 250), which acts as a preservative and enhances color and flavor. However, grilling these products can trigger a chemical reaction between nitrite and naturally occurring amines, leading to the formation of dangerous, carcinogenic nitrosamines. The European Food Safety Authority has classified ten such nitrosamines as genotoxic and carcinogenic, concluding that current intake levels in the EU pose a public health risk. Experts advocate for stricter regulations and the adoption of proven, safer nitrite-free alternatives, already available in some European countries, to eliminate this health hazard.</p>

          <p>The legendary fictional rock trio Spinal Tap is returning for a long-awaited sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," which follows their latest comeback attempt and first public performance since 2009. Band members David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls expressed lingering frustration over their portrayal in the original 1984 mockumentary and the director's secrecy about the new film. Despite their advanced age and the band's history of internal acrimony and bizarre mishaps, including a high mortality rate among their drummers, the article highlights their enduring bond and unique place in rock 'n' roll history, attracting tributes from real-life music icons.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is grappling with a severe housing shortage and a high vacancy rate in downtown office buildings, prompting a proposal to convert these empty skyscrapers into residential units. While traditional apartment conversions are often financially unfeasible without significant public subsidy, a more innovative solution is "co-living" spaces. These units, described as "dorms for adults," offer small, affordable studios with shared communal kitchens and bathrooms, potentially costing only $1,000 per month. This approach could yield three times as many units as conventional conversions at a third of the cost per square foot, providing a vital stepping stone for low and moderate-income Angelenos and revitalizing the city center.

          <p>Big-screen comedies have seen a significant decline in box office revenue and theatrical releases over the past decade, with much of the genre's content migrating to streaming services. However, a recent spate of theatrical releases, including "The Naked Gun" and "Freakier Friday," is attempting to revive the genre's presence in cinemas. Filmmakers and producers emphasize the unique communal experience of laughing together in a theater, similar to shared scares in horror films. Industry experts point to challenges like increased production costs, evolving humor, and limited international appeal, suggesting that modest budgets and reliance on known intellectual property might be crucial for the genre's successful resurgence.</p>

Despite his immense musical success, Gaye struggled with deep depression, paranoia, and a severe cocaine addiction, which led him to live with his parents. The fatal confrontation arose from his father's resentment and jealousy.

          <p>A study published in the journal Cell reveals that surgically implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), designed to enable paralyzed individuals to speak, can also inadvertently decode their inner monologue. Researchers successfully translated imagined speech signals into words with up to 74% accuracy from a vast vocabulary, demonstrating a potential for faster communication. However, this breakthrough also raised "unsettling" questions about mental privacy, as faint signals from inner thoughts could unintentionally "leak out." While safeguards like "wake phrases" were explored, experts warn that the rapid advancement of this technology outpaces measures to protect cognitive privacy, especially with the future development of consumer BCIs.</p>
