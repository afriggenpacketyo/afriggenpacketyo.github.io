          <p>Lyle Menendez, 57, was denied parole, ensuring he remains incarcerated alongside his younger brother Erik, whose parole was similarly rejected the previous day. Both were convicted for the 1989 murders of their parents in Beverly Hills, with the brothers claiming self-defense after years of alleged sexual and emotional abuse. However, prosecutors argued they were motivated by greed. The parole board cited Lyle's illicit cellphone use in prison and an assessment indicating anti-social traits as key reasons for the denial, despite his reported positive behavior and educational pursuits while incarcerated. This decision marks a significant setback for the Menendez brothers, who still have potential avenues for freedom through future parole hearings or a clemency request to Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has expanded a previous ruling, blocking the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties across the U.S., including major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and Chicago. The judge had earlier ruled it unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funds for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These cities argue such policies represent an "abuse of power" and infringe upon the Tenth Amendment, asserting that local control over law enforcement fosters trust within communities. Conversely, the administration contends that sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement and make it harder to apprehend undocumented individuals, including violent criminals.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars are pouring into campaigns surrounding a November ballot initiative to redraw California's congressional districts, with a notable $10 million donation from independent redistricting advocate Charles Munger Jr. The proposed redrawing, spearheaded by California Democrats, aims to increase Democratic representation in Congress, directly countering similar efforts by Texas Republicans and President Trump to boost GOP members. Proponents argue this "Election Rigging Response Act" is America's best chance to fight back against perceived attempts to rig the 2026 midterms. Conversely, opponents, including Munger, champion independent commissions to protect voter interests, accusing the Democratic-led effort of partisan manipulation. This significant financial influx underscores the high stakes and deep partisan divide in the ongoing national redistricting battles.</p>

Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares blasted the "idiocy," while Democratic state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi and attorney general candidate Jay Jones also denounced the "horrific display of racism." Although Earle-Sears acknowledged the condemnation, she criticized her gubernatorial opponent's response as insufficiently strong, highlighting ongoing political tensions surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has implemented a ban on unprocessed rare earth metal exports, signaling its intent to develop robust downstream industries and leverage its existing processing capabilities. This strategic move positions Malaysia as a potential alternative, non-Chinese source for the mineral-hungry United States, which is actively seeking to diversify its critical mineral supply chains amidst strained trade relations with China. Foreign investors are explicitly encouraged to participate in Malaysia's rare earth sector, provided their projects involve local mineral processing, job creation, and technology transfers. Analysts suggest this policy allows Malaysia to prioritize its own economic development needs, exercising its geoeconomic agency, while potentially attracting significant foreign investment in the process.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has officially surpassed the United States as the leading initial public offering (IPO) venue for mainland Chinese companies, marking a significant milestone for the city's capital market. In the first eight months of 2025, 46 Chinese firms raised a combined $16.5 billion via IPOs on the Hong Kong stock exchange, significantly outpacing the 16 listings by Chinese companies in the U.S. which garnered only $740.9 million. This notable shift is attributed to Hong Kong's more active market, where new shares have jumped by an average of 19.4% in their trading debuts, and the lingering risks of delisting for Chinese stocks in the U.S. due to unclear regulatory prospects. This trend reflects a broader return of investment funds and a strategic preference for Asian markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Fresno County Superior Court Judge Adolfo Corona, 66, faces additional federal charges, including two counts of sexual assault against two court employees and multiple allegations of obstructing the subsequent investigations. He was initially indicted last year on state charges of sexual battery and forced sexual penetration. Federal prosecutors allege Corona sexually assaulted one employee in a stairwell in March 2024 and subsequently lied to the FBI and court administrators about the incident. Furthermore, the indictment claims that in December 2023, he was alone with another court employee who was later found passed out, for which he allegedly fabricated an alibi and attempted to convince a dealership employee to falsify records. Corona, who retired in April 2024, now faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted, highlighting serious allegations of abuse of power within the judicial system.</p>

          <p>A new European study published in the journal Science Advances reveals that air pollution stemming from oil and gas activities disproportionately impacts communities of color across the U.S., contributing to an estimated 91,000 premature deaths annually. The research highlights that Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian Americans face higher health risks from pollution generated at every stage of the fossil fuel life cycle, from exploration and drilling to the burning of fuels in vehicles and factories. The study also links this pollution to 10,350 preterm births and 216,000 new cases of childhood asthma nationwide, with California, and specifically Los Angeles County, ranking among the most affected areas. This comprehensive data underscores the profound racial disparities in environmental health burdens, often rooted in historical zoning practices like redlining.</p>

He also admitted to a misdemeanor count of possession of a stun gun by a convicted felon.

The cause of the fire, potential chemical risks, and the timeline for containment remain unknown, with the Department of Environmental Quality and Environmental Protection Agency now on site. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged residents to follow local guidance, emphasizing the paramount importance of everyone's safety during the ongoing emergency.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted a court-authorized search of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home in Bethesda, Maryland, and his office in Washington D.C. on Friday morning, reportedly in connection with a classified documents investigation. President Trump claimed he learned of the raid from television news, using the opportunity to call Bolton a "lowlife" and question his patriotism. Top U.S. law enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, posted on social media emphasizing that "NO ONE is above the law." Bolton, who served as National Security Adviser during Trump's first term, authored an unflattering memoir that the previous administration attempted to block, leading to a criminal inquiry into classified information disclosure, which was later closed by the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Research indicates a growing political divide in Britain, with young women increasingly identifying as left-wing while young men appear to lean more towards the right. A 2025 survey revealed that 20% of young British women identified as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with women showing a strong preference for the Green Party and men demonstrating increased support for Reform UK. Experts suggest that factors such as higher education rates among women, the influence of social media, and evolving perspectives on gender equality contribute to this widening gap. This article highlights a significant and complex shift in youth voting patterns, which could have profound implications for future political landscapes and party strategies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel patrolling the streets of Washington D.C. to be armed, significantly intensifying President Trump's ongoing crime crackdown in the nation's capital. This decision reverses a previous stance that troops involved in the deployment, which now numbers approximately 2,000, would not carry weapons. President Trump lauded the mission as having brought "total safety" to D.C. and suggested expanding the operation to Chicago, despite local officials expressing grave concerns about the federal intervention and its potential to inflame tensions. The administration is reportedly considering declaring a national emergency to extend the deployment beyond its initial 30-day deadline, indicating a sustained federal presence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro pledging aggressive prosecution to back law enforcement. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers are a poor indicator of public safety, as they often do not lead to criminal charges or convictions and can simply reflect increased police presence rather than a genuine reduction in crime. The article highlights that approximately 40% of the arrests during this initiative were immigration-related, and many others were for minor offenses. Experts warn that this "flooding the zone" strategy with law enforcement can lead to more instances of police use of force and typically results in only short-lived crime deterrence, raising questions about the true impact on community safety.</p>

This incident is part of an exceptionally busy fire year across the U.S., with over 44,800 ignitions, the highest in a decade.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, now faces potential deportation to Uganda by the Trump administration, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official. Hours after a judge ordered his release from pre-trial detention in Tennessee, his attorneys received a court-required notice of his potential deportation to the East African country. Uganda recently agreed to a U.S. request to accept deportees who are not its citizens, a practice the Trump administration has increasingly used for undocumented immigrants in recent months. Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, had previously been ruled unable to be deported there by an immigration judge due to fears of persecution by local gangs.</p>

          <p>A Colorado judge made the rare decision to reject a plea agreement for Jon Hallford, a funeral home owner who admitted to abusing 191 corpses, after emotional testimony from victims' families demanded a more severe punishment. Hallford and his wife, Carie, ran a fraudulent scheme through their Return to Nature Funeral Home, taking money for cremations but instead stashing bodies and giving families dry concrete resembling ashes. The rejected deal, which proposed a 20-year concurrent federal and state sentence, was seen by families as erasing the gravity of the crimes committed. This decision highlights Colorado's past struggles with funeral home oversight and the profound, long-lasting impact of deception on grieving families, who felt their experiences were finally heard by the court.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive crackdown on homeless encampments in Washington D.C., involving federal agents clearing streets and levying penalties, mirrors a controversial policy enacted in San Francisco following a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling. While some in San Francisco credit this more aggressive approach with significantly reducing visible encampments, advocates for people living on the streets argue it punishes individuals for having no place to live, merely cycling them through the system. The article notes that despite a visible decline in tents, San Francisco's overall homeless population has continued to rise. This comparison highlights ongoing national debates about the effectiveness and humanity of "get-tough" approaches versus providing housing and services for a complex social problem.</p>

This rapid surge in ETH price also significantly boosted shares of crypto-focused companies. Analysts suggest that recent regulatory tailwinds and the increasing institutional interest in stablecoins, which account for a large portion of blockchain fees and are heavily powered by the Ethereum blockchain, are positioning Ether as a significant macro trade for the coming 10 to 15 years.

While some cafes, like Hyun Sung-joo's, welcome moderate Cagongjok, others have implemented "No Study Zones" or time limits to manage space. This widespread cultural trend reflects South Korea's hyper-competitive society and a perceived lack of adequate public study spaces, posing a significant dilemma for cafe owners balancing business needs with customer accommodation.</p>
