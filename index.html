          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed designating Apple and Google with a "strategic market status," enabling regulators to enforce changes to their mobile ecosystems. The investigation focuses on potential anti-competitive practices in their app stores, browsers, and operating systems, including unfair commission fees and favoring their own services. Both tech giants have contested the proposals, arguing the changes would compromise user security and innovation. This action aligns with broader European regulatory pressure on major tech firms.

          <p>Germany's ruling coalition is experiencing internal friction after declining to sign a joint declaration with 28 other Western nations condemning Israel's actions and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. While senior government officials maintain a united front, key figures from the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), have publicly urged the government to join the condemnation. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's administration defends its position by emphasizing the need for clarity on Hamas's role and asserting that private diplomacy is more effective, reflecting Germany's complex policy regarding Israel.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled their original trials were unfair, a significant vindication for the traders who maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for what were considered normal practices at the time. Hayes, who served five and a half years in prison, described the conviction as having destroyed his family. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson initiated an early August recess to mitigate a Republican party dispute over releasing federal investigation files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move some members are pushing via a bipartisan petition. Concurrently, Columbia University has disciplined over 70 students with measures including suspensions and expulsions for their involvement in a pro-Palestinian protest. The university's actions are under scrutiny by the Trump administration as part of a broader focus on campus antisemitism, which has reportedly affected both Jewish and Muslim students.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and Save the Children, has issued a stark warning about "mass starvation" in Gaza. In a joint statement, the groups accuse the Israeli government of implementing a siege that severely restricts aid, leading to chaos and death among Palestinian civilians. The statement highlights record rates of acute malnutrition, particularly among children and the elderly, with reports of aid workers themselves now having to queue for food to feed their families.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's expansive use of executive power creates a precarious precedent for future administrations, regardless of party. While a future Democratic president could theoretically reverse many of Trump's actions, such as reconstituting federal agencies or reinstating funding, the damage to institutional expertise and stability may be difficult to repair. The article argues these new powers are inherently destructive, making it easier to dismantle government functions than to build them. This could lead to a volatile cycle of retaliatory politics and policy whiplash, ultimately favoring a long-term reduction in government.</p>

          <p>Janita Phillips, 65, has been sentenced to five years of probation for killing her infant son in Connecticut in 1986. Phillips pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge after new DNA testing linked her to the cold case in 2021. The judge granted the unusual sentence, avoiding prison time, after a psychological assessment concluded she was under "extreme emotional distress" at the time of the crime, having recently been homeless and stressed about finances. Phillips, who had no other criminal record, went on to raise a family in Florida for decades.</p>

          <p>In a new measure to crack down on illegal working, the UK Home Office will share the locations of hotels housing asylum seekers with food delivery companies like Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Uber Eats. The agreement aims to help the firms identify suspicious activity, such as delivery accounts operating frequently near these locations, which could indicate that asylum seekers, who are not permitted to work, are using shared accounts. This initiative is part of a broader government strategy to tackle illegal migration and follows a commitment from the companies to tighten identity checks on their riders.</p>

Germany's auto industry association urged the EU to intensify its negotiation efforts, emphasizing that a solution is now more crucial than ever. The U.S. is a critical export market for the EU's automotive sector, which has been vulnerable to trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

Currently, this status is primarily determined by financial thresholds, but the bill's sponsor argues that financial knowledge is a better measure of a person's ability to weigh investment risks.

          <p>A detailed report outlines China's decades-long strategy to dominate the global market for rare earth elements, which are critical for everything from smartphones to defense systems. Although the U.S. once led the industry, China leveraged state-backed initiatives, low-cost production, and aggressive consolidation to control nearly the entire refining process. This chokehold, achieved by winnowing hundreds of chaotic private mines into six state-controlled giants, has given Beijing a powerful tool in its trade war with the U.S. Now, American startups are attempting to rebuild domestic refining capacity to counter this dependency.</p>
