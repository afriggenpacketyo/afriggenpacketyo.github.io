            <p>Tyler Glasnow, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, left Sunday's game against the Rangers after just four innings due to lower leg cramping, raising concerns given his history of injuries. Despite the early exit, the initial diagnosis suggests the issue is not serious, similar to a cramping incident last season where he missed no time. The Dodgers, already dealing with injuries to Blake Snell and Blake Treinen, can ill afford to lose Glasnow for an extended period as they aim for a successful season. Glasnow's health will be closely monitored as he remains a crucial part of the Dodgers' pitching rotation.</p>

            <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old US citizen, was wrongfully detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days, despite repeatedly asserting his citizenship.

His family provided his birth certificate and social security card after tracking him to a detention facility. This incident is part of a pattern of wrongful detentions of US citizens by immigration officials, with the Trump administration's policies emboldening such errors.</p>

            <p>The Texas House passed a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition, following nearly 11 hours of debate. The bill, supported by Governor Greg Abbott and President Trump, will provide $10,000 per year for students attending private schools, with higher amounts for disabled and home-schooled students. Democrats criticized the bill as "welfare for the rich" and expressed concerns about its impact on public school funding. The bill now moves to the Texas Senate for further consideration.</p>

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba has sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, which is controversial due to its enshrinement of war criminals alongside other war dead. This act is likely to draw criticism from neighboring countries, particularly China and South Korea, who view the shrine as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The offering was made during the shrine's spring festival. The Prime Minister's action continues a long-standing practice by Japanese leaders, often aimed at appeasing conservative elements within the country.</p>

The transfer puts the future of current UCLA quarterback Joey Aguilar in doubt. Iamaleava's arrival could also signal a smoothing over of hard feelings between the Iamaleava family and UCLA after his younger brother backed out of a commitment to the team.</p>
