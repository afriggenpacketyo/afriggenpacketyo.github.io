          <h2>Bridgend Council Faces Criticism Over Presentation on Sexual Strangulation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 01:11:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridgend council in Wales has been criticized for creating a PowerPoint presentation that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex for use in schools. The slides included the sentence: "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claims it was a draft version and was dropped after feedback, but experts and politicians have questioned why such content was ever considered appropriate. The presentation was commissioned from the council's in-house domestic abuse service, and concerns have been raised about the broader content of sex education lessons in schools. The council maintains the slide was intended to stimulate debate before advising participants that non-fatal strangulation is a dangerous, illegal crime.</p>

          <p>Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns have launched a joint bid for the co-leadership of the Green Party of England and Wales, joining deputy leader Zack Polanski in the contest. Ramsay, who previously served as co-leader with Carla Denyer, is seeking re-election, while Denyer will not be standing. Chowns emphasized the need for leaders at the heart of national politics, while Ramsay highlighted the party's potential to hold the balance of power. Polanski has focused his campaign on building a mass movement to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, as the Greens look to build on recent electoral gains. The party will vote in August and announce the results on September 2.</p>

          <p>In Serbia, a resilient student-led movement is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The movement, sparked by corruption-related tragedies, has grown into the largest and most extensive protest in years, uniting diverse groups against the government. The government's attempts to quell the protests through resignations and financial incentives have failed, as evidenced by massive demonstrations in Belgrade. Protesters are employing innovative tactics like blocking the national broadcaster and organizing assemblies, demonstrating a commitment to solidarity and horizontal decision-making, setting an example for democratic movements worldwide. This New York Times article highlights the bravery and endurance of Serbian students as they push for early elections.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The release is also intended to facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade. Direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official are reportedly underway in Qatar. The Israeli PM's office has acknowledged the planned release but emphasized that preparations to intensify fighting are continuing, and the release was made possible by military pressure on Hamas, a development confirmed by President Trump on Truth Social. The release is seen as a goodwill gesture and a step towards resuming negotiations for all remaining hostages.</p>

Buseoksa Temple in South Korea filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, but South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023.</p>

          <p>Despite a US-mediated ceasefire ending recent hostilities between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, experts from both countries express skepticism about long-term peace. While acknowledging the US's helpful role in de-escalating the conflict, analysts emphasize that deep-seated distrust and unresolved issues like terrorism and water security pose significant challenges. Some suggest that the ceasefire is likely to hold in the short term due to international pressure and the recognition of the costs of escalation, but the fragility of the agreement and the potential for future flare-ups remain a concern.

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses, siblings, parents, and adult children of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also be restricted from recruiting staff from abroad. The move is seen as an attempt to address concerns about rising legal migration and counter the surge of Reform UK, which has gained traction by advocating for tighter immigration controls. The government also plans to prioritize residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, have high-skilled jobs, or volunteer in the community, with migrants now required to wait ten years to become British citizens.</p>

The White House called it a "trade deal" but gave no further details. These were the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing. The talks have raised hopes of tariff reductions and a de-escalation of the trade war, which has caused turmoil in financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>

Despite efforts by successive governments to reduce net migration, the numbers have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the 2016 EU referendum. Brexit and the implementation of a new immigration policy in 2021 have not reversed the trend, with net migration figures remaining elevated. The Labour government aims to buck this 25-year trend of rising legal migration, seeking to address public concerns and fulfill promises of greater control over immigration.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's tax bill aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. The measure, which would make "large groups who provide abortion services" ineligible for federal Medicaid dollars, has raised concerns about how these groups are defined. Some Republicans argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services. Several moderate Republicans have communicated to House GOP leaders that they could oppose the final bill if the provision is included, potentially jeopardizing its passage given the House's narrow Republican majority.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has defended the possibility of receiving a luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family to replace Air Force One, describing it as a "very transparent deal". The potential gift has drawn criticism, with some describing it as bribery and foreign influence. The US Constitution restricts government officials from accepting presents from foreign states without congressional consent. Ali al Ansari, Qatar's media attache to the US, said the "possible transfer of an aircraft ... is currently under consideration". Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer mocked the situation, saying, "Nothing says 'America First' like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have unveiled legislation proposing significant cuts to Medicaid spending by imposing new restrictions on beneficiaries, such as work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks. The bill aims to save $880 billion as part of an effort to slash at least $1.5 trillion to pay for Trump’s domestic priorities, including an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. The legislation prohibits Medicaid funding from being used for gender-affirming care for minors and restricts reimbursements to community health providers like Planned Parenthood that provide family planning and abortion services. Democrats have criticized the bill, arguing that it would increase the number of uninsured Americans and cut health care to the bone.</p>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad argues that President Trump's tariffs will harm Americans more than targeted countries, increasing the U.S. cost of living. He believes American products cannot compete with cheaper foreign goods and predicts Trump will eventually reverse his decision. Mahathir suggests ASEAN can weather the impact through intergroup trade and business with other countries. He advocates for peace and dialogue, echoing the stance of ASEAN trade ministers, rather than retaliation to address concerns over the tariffs' impact on the region's economy.</p>

This is an attempt to revive a program he tried and failed to implement during his first term.
