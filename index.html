          <p>The Ohio Conference of Teamsters, representing over 50,000 workers, has endorsed Vivek Ramaswamy in the 2026 gubernatorial race, a notable shift from its history of supporting Democratic candidates. This endorsement adds to a growing list of labor unions backing the Republican entrepreneur, including plumbers, pipefitters, and carpenters. Ramaswamy's campaign highlights this as a sign of a burgeoning movement focused on workers' dignity and economic opportunity, transcending traditional party lines. The move is particularly significant as the union previously supported Democrat Tim Ryan, and a portion of Ramaswamy's recent fundraising has come from Ryan's former donors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new "Gold Card" visa program through an executive order, offering an expedited path to permanent residency for individuals who donate at least $1 million to the Commerce Department. Corporations can sponsor individuals for $2 million. This initiative is set to replace existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa programs, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stating that a significant financial contribution demonstrates "exceptional value" to the nation. The administration is also considering a non-citizenship "Platinum Card" for a $5 million donation, which would offer tax benefits.</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old Argentinian hiker, Matias Augusto Travizano, died after falling approximately 2,000 feet down Wintun Glacier on Mount Shasta. After successfully reaching the summit, Travizano became lost during his descent on the Clear Creek Trail and attempted a controlled slide on an ice sheet, but lost his grip and collided with a boulder. This incident marks the second fatality on the same trail in just over a month, highlighting the treacherous conditions despite its reputation as an easier route. Officials emphasize the dangers of the mountain, where weather can change dramatically, and urge climbers to use GPS and climb with partners.</p>

          <p>The Speaker of the UK House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has expressed serious concern that Parliament is now more vulnerable to espionage after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped spying charges against two men. The men, Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash, were accused of gathering information for China but the charges were dropped because the "evidential threshold" was not met. Sir Lindsay described himself as "a very unhappy speaker" over the decision and stated it "leaves the door open to foreign actors." The move has been criticized by the Home Office, while the Prime Minister's office has reiterated that any foreign infiltration is unacceptable.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr, comparing his threats against ABC over Jimmy Kimmel's suspension to the tactics of a mobster. While stating he was "thrilled" Kimmel was suspended for his comments about the late Charlie Kirk, Cruz warned that the government threatening a broadcaster's license is "dangerous as hell" and sets a perilous precedent for free speech. Cruz's comments represent a significant break from many conservatives, including President Trump, who defended the FCC's actions. The controversy stems from the FCC pressing Disney-owned ABC to take action against Kimmel, leading to his indefinite suspension.</p>

          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has warned that declining U.S. engagement in Asia, particularly its deteriorating relationship with India, is undermining regional alliances and creating strategic opportunities for China. Speaking at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, the researcher highlighted the weakening of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which includes the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia. From Japan's perspective, the Quad is a crucial diplomatic tool for maintaining a balance of power against China. President Trump's perceived lack of interest in the framework and his decision not to attend a summit in New Delhi are seen as potentially dangerous developments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he ordered a third lethal military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." The strike targeted a boat in international waters that was allegedly trafficking illicit narcotics and affiliated with a designated terrorist organization. This action follows a new policy classifying drug cartels as terrorist groups, which legally permits the use of military force typically reserved for preventing imminent attacks on Americans. Critics have questioned the legal justification for these strikes, raising concerns that they could constitute war crimes and a departure from previous law enforcement interdiction methods.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has revealed significant issues with counterfeit goods and fraudulent sellers on Walmart.com's third-party marketplace, a key driver of the retailer's e-commerce growth. Shoppers have received fake products, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty items, from sellers who often use the stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create their accounts. The report suggests that in its push to compete with Amazon, Walmart relaxed its seller vetting processes, creating a "Wild West" environment that bad actors have exploited. In response to the findings, Walmart stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for counterfeit goods and has since tightened vetting for some sellers.</p>

The reported agreement would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the country while licensing algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. However, confirmation from Beijing was less clear, with state media quoting Xi as welcoming negotiations. The ownership of TikTok's powerful algorithm remains a key point of contention, and some U.S. lawmakers continue to express national security concerns over ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>A major security operation involving multiple federal, state, and local agencies is being implemented for the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with over 100,000 people expected to attend. The event, taking place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, has been designated a SEAR-1 level event by DHS, comparable to the Super Bowl. A security bulletin noted "several threats of unknown credibility" are being tracked, as the attendance of President Trump and other high-profile officials makes the service an attractive target for violent extremists. Security measures include counterterrorism sniper teams, drones, and extensive surveillance to ensure safety.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 19:21:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses of networks critical of the administration have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over media. Broadcasters like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox use public airwaves via licenses granted by the FCC, which requires them to operate in the "public interest." While this term is typically applied to issues like obscenity or local programming, the current administration is linking it to political coverage. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process subject to legal challenges and that using this power to punish political speech is an unprecedented and contentious issue.</p>

          <p>Brett James, the 57-year-old Grammy-winning songwriter famous for co-writing Carrie Underwood's hit "Jesus, Take the Wheel," was killed in a plane crash in North Carolina. James was one of three people who died when the single-engine aircraft they were in went down in a wooded area near Macon County Airport. Underwood mourned his death, calling him "the epitome of 'cool'" and stating his passing leaves a significant void. James was a prolific writer, penning over 500 songs for artists across genres, including Taylor Swift and Bon Jovi, and was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020.</p>

The downpours have been particularly destructive in areas previously scorched by wildfires, where the landscape is more vulnerable to erosion.

          <p>David Gandy, one of the world's most recognizable male models, has raised concerns about the growing use of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry, warning it poses an existential threat. Gandy, who joins over 2,000 other models in calling for government regulation, points to campaigns that now use entirely AI-generated models, making real models, photographers, and makeup artists redundant. He fears that without proper oversight, this trend could damage the industry's artistry and create unrealistic beauty standards with unknown mental health impacts. Gandy emphasizes the need for regulation to protect the rights and livelihoods of people working in fashion.</p>

          <p>Russia has revived Intervision, a Soviet-era song contest, as its answer to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The event, a brainchild of Vladimir Putin, features 23 participating countries, primarily allies from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, including China, Brazil, and South Africa. The contest is framed by the Kremlin as a way to foster cultural cooperation but is widely seen as a geopolitical project to demonstrate that Russia is not isolated. Unlike the kitsch and public voting of Eurovision, Intervision emphasizes traditional culture and uses a jury system, with senior Kremlin officials overseeing the event.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of major investments in the UK by U.S. tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft has sparked optimism about the country's potential as an "AI superpower." The investments, totaling billions of pounds, are focused on building AI infrastructure and leveraging the UK's strong scientific research base. While this influx of capital is seen as a significant boost for economic growth, it also raises questions about the UK's increasing dependence on U.S. technology and whether it is "clinging on to the coattails of Uncle Sam." The trend suggests a strategic alignment between the UK and U.S. on AI development, potentially positioning the UK as a key tech laboratory for American firms. (not investment advice)</p>

The demonstrators, including two Democratic congressional candidates, were attempting to block vehicles during "Operation Midway Blitz," a local immigration crackdown. At least three arrests were made as masked agents in riot gear confronted the crowd, with one candidate describing the response as a "violent abuse of power." The protest follows a surge in ICE raids in the city and the recent fatal shooting of a man by an immigration officer in the area.</p>

          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests that align with some, but not all, of the demands made by the Trump administration. The guidelines, which come after a contentious year of pro-Palestinian demonstrations, ban unauthorized encampments and the use of masks while violating policy, but they also expand free speech zones. The rules were enacted as the university faces the threat of losing hundreds of millions in federal research funding over its handling of past protests. While the university insists the policies are content-neutral, critics worry they are overly broad and could be used to stifle free speech.</p>
