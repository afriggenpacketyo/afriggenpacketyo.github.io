          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy can increase breast cancer risk in women under 55. In contrast, the research found that using estrogen alone, a treatment typically prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy, was associated with a reduced risk. This research provides a more nuanced understanding of hormone replacement therapy, highlighting that the specific type of treatment is a crucial factor in its safety profile.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, has officially admitted to murdering four University of Idaho students in their off-campus home in November 2022. He pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty, and he will now face multiple life sentences without parole. The plea brings a formal conclusion to a case that shocked the nation, though it has left the victims' families divided on the resolution.</p>

This evidence included his DNA on a knife sheath left at the crime scene, which was matched using a Q-tip secretly retrieved from his family's trash. Additionally, investigators used cell phone data that placed him near the home multiple times before the attack and noted that his car had been meticulously cleaned to remove any trace of the crime.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study shows that Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant jump from his 36% share in 2020. Political analysts suggest this trend reflects a turn towards populism driven by economic concerns and a sense of disillusionment with the Democratic party, rather than a purely ideological shift to conservatism. Experts in this article argue that both parties have largely failed to address the key priorities of this diverse and evolving demographic.</p>

This updated assessment from the defense department is more measured than former President Trump's initial claims of complete obliteration but still suggests a significant degradation of Iran's capabilities. The analysis is reportedly based on intelligence indicating that critical components, such as centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site, were destroyed in the attack.</p>
