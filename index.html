The new measure seeks to repeal the abortion-rights amendment and instead allow abortions only for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, or in cases of sexual assault or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Unsubstantiated claims of French President Macron's alleged cocaine use on a train to Ukraine have spread rapidly online, originating from a French account and amplified by US conspiracy theorists and Russian officials. The posts inaccurately claimed a white tissue was a bag of cocaine. Macron's office dismissed the rumor as "fake news" spread by France's enemies. The article traces the spread of the disinformation, highlighting the role of social media and various online actors in amplifying the false claims.</p>

          <p>The article distinguishes between two types of police officers: showboaters and real cops. Showboaters prioritize appearing tough and often skirt due process, while real cops focus on upholding the law within a constitutional system. The author argues that the Trump administration's approach to law enforcement often favors showboating, which can undermine the efforts of real cops who rely on community trust. The article emphasizes the importance of fighting crime while safeguarding freedom, requiring a legal sensibility and respect for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that the Interior Department made an error in listing the bird. This move raises concerns about the administration's commitment to wildlife protection, particularly for species in areas with oil and gas drilling. Environmental advocates fear that this could set a precedent for delisting other threatened species and prioritize energy development over conservation.</p>

The justices' decision will determine whether federal judges can swiftly block policies or if groups must bring individual claims.

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after growing more than expected in the first three months of the year, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The 0.7% growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment. However, the article notes that the growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. The stronger-than-expected growth figure has tempered market expectations for further interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year, surpassing expectations.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the services sector drove much of the growth. While the stronger-than-expected growth figure has tempered market expectations for further interest rate cuts, a recent deal with the US may alleviate some tariff concerns.</p>
