          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared the end of a significant measles outbreak that infected over 700 people, the largest in the state in three decades. The outbreak, which began in January near Gaines County, resulted in nearly 100 hospitalizations and the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The declaration came after 42 days passed without a new case, a standard timeframe based on the virus's incubation period. Despite this positive development, officials warn that vigilance is crucial due to declining vaccination rates and ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

          <p>As Labor Day approaches on September 1, 2025, this article serves as a practical guide for the holiday weekend. It outlines the history of the federal holiday, which was established in 1894 to honor the American worker and now marks the unofficial end of summer. The summary details which major retailers, grocery stores, and fast-food chains will remain open, while noting that government services, banks, the stock market, and Costco will be closed. It provides context on the holiday's origins in the labor movement, contrasting it with the modern focus on sales and gatherings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Marine Corps recruitment billboard in Memphis, Tennessee, was defaced with a large, offensive banner, sparking shock among local residents. The original sign posed the question "What do Marines fight for?", to which the vandalized banner responded with a derogatory message referencing a controversial immigration detention facility. The Marine Corps Recruiting Command acknowledged the incident, stating they remain focused on their mission, and the graffiti was quickly removed. The act drew condemnation from the community for its disrespectful nature towards the military, though no official police report has been filed.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Age Considerations for Purchasing Retirement Annuities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether age limits exist for purchasing annuities, a retirement product offering guaranteed income. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies often impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85, due to risk assessment related to life expectancy. The text explains that the optimal time to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific age, though purchasing in one's late 50s to mid-60s is often advised. It provides context on how timing affects payout rates and product availability for those planning their financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

The prosecution is focusing on his international connections, including meetings with U.S. officials, to build its case under the controversial national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020. The trial, which has drawn international attention and criticism, could result in a life sentence for Lai if he is convicted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has expressed new concern for the protection of bald and golden eagles from wind turbines, a move critics interpret as a thinly veiled attack on renewable energy. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to enforce the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act against wind projects. However, the article points out the hypocrisy of this stance, noting that far greater threats to birds—such as cats, buildings, and climate change—are largely ignored by the administration. Furthermore, the same administration has worked to weaken broader environmental protections that have been instrumental in the bald eagle's successful population recovery.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, restoring the quorum needed for the legislature to conduct business. Their departure was a protest against a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in a way that could add up to five GOP seats in the 2026 midterms. Democrats stated they returned to build a legal case against what they call a "discriminatory map" and have rallied national attention to the issue. With the legislature back in session, the controversial redistricting bill is expected to advance, setting the stage for legal battles and potential retaliatory redistricting in Democrat-controlled states.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, President Donald Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for negotiating a peace deal to end the war with Russia. This marks a reversal from his earlier stance where he threatened "severe consequences" if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire. Trump referenced other international conflicts he claimed to have resolved without ceasefires, suggesting a peace agreement could be worked on while fighting continues. The meeting, which also included European leaders, aimed to find a path toward ending the war, with Trump indicating a potential trilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin.</p>

In other market news, Eli Lilly's stock remained stable despite competitor Novo Nordisk cutting the price of its diabetes drug Ozempic for cash-paying patients.

          <p>A new analysis indicates that despite wage growth, the average American's earnings are still lagging 1.2 percentage points behind the rise in cost of living over the past four years. This persistent gap helps explain ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households feel their purchasing power has diminished since the pandemic. The study highlights that educators have experienced the largest deficit between pay raises and inflation. Conversely, professions in high demand post-pandemic, such as leisure, hospitality, and healthcare, have seen wages that outpaced inflation, reflecting shifts in labor market power.

The settlement was reached before a trial could determine malice, following a judge's prior ruling that Newsmax had indeed defamed Dominion.

The initiative is a collaboration with Hussle's estate and is part of Metro's Culture Series, celebrating influential Angelenos.</p>

          <p>Southern California and the Southwest are preparing for what meteorologists are calling the most dangerous heat wave of the summer, with temperatures expected to soar into the triple digits this week. An extreme heat watch is in effect for much of the region, with inland areas like the San Fernando Valley and the Inland Empire potentially reaching 108 and 104 degrees, respectively. The National Weather Service warns that the intense heat, which will be 10 to 20 degrees above normal, will also create elevated and explosive fire conditions. Officials are urging residents to take precautions by staying hydrated and avoiding outdoor activities during peak heat.</p>

          <p>This article breaks down the significant financial impact of carrying a large credit card balance, using a $25,000 debt as an example. With the average credit card APR hovering around 22%, such a balance would accrue approximately $5,500 in interest charges in a single year. The text explains that making only the minimum monthly payments would extend the repayment period to decades and could result in paying tens of thousands of dollars in interest alone. It outlines several strategies to mitigate these costs, including making more than the minimum payment, utilizing a 0% APR balance transfer, or consolidating debt with a lower-interest loan.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican redistricting plans in Texas, California Democrats have unveiled a proposal to redraw their state's U.S. House districts to favor their party. The plan, if enacted, could potentially shift five Republican-held seats to Democrats, effectively neutralizing the GOP's expected gains in Texas and bolstering the Democratic effort to control Congress. This unusual mid-decade redistricting would require a constitutional amendment passed by a two-thirds legislative vote and subsequent approval from California voters in a special election. The move sets up a significant political and legal battle over gerrymandering, escalating a nationwide fight for congressional control ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>Gateway Church, one of the largest megachurches in the U.S., has officially installed Daniel Floyd as its new lead pastor. This leadership change comes 14 months after founding pastor Robert Morris stepped down amid allegations of child sexual abuse, for which he now faces criminal charges in Oklahoma. In his first sermon, Floyd acknowledged the weight of the moment and promised to lead with integrity, aiming to start a new chapter for the congregation. The transition occurs as the church and Morris navigate multiple legal challenges, including a defamation lawsuit filed by the accuser and a dispute over Morris's retirement payments.</p>

          <p>The recent £40 million transfer of academy graduate Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa to Newcastle United has united fans of both clubs in frustration over the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Because Ramsey is a homegrown player, his sale represents pure profit for Aston Villa, helping the club comply with strict financial regulations that limit losses over a three-year period. However, fans and even club figures lament that these rules incentivize selling beloved, homegrown talent to balance the books. The article explains how PSR disproportionately affects ambitious clubs trying to challenge the established top teams, who have much larger revenue streams.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the availability of an over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, is successfully reaching its target demographic. Research published in JAMA Network Open found that nearly a third of people who obtained the OTC pill had previously been using no form of contraception. Furthermore, 41% switched from less effective methods like condoms. The study indicates that the pill is particularly being used by younger, uninsured, and rural individuals, who often face the greatest barriers to accessing prescription healthcare. The primary reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

          <p>The era of the "great resignation" has given way to the "great stay," with consultants coining the term "job hugging" to describe workers clinging to their current positions. The rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting a cooling labor market and increased worker anxiety about finding new employment. This trend is a stark reversal from the high job-hopping rates of 2021 and 2022. Experts note that while staying put provides stability, it can also lead to wage stagnation and may make it harder for new entrants to find jobs.</p>
