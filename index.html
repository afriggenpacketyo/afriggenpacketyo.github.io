          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv, expressing gratitude to Donald Trump for his perceived role in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. US special envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed hostages are returning, while Palestinian officials reported 500,000 people had moved back to northern Gaza. An upcoming summit in Egypt, attended by multiple leaders including Trump, aims to finalize the war's end. The ceasefire agreement mandates Hamas release 48 remaining hostages by Monday morning, a process confirmed by a top Hamas official.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a move expected to save US$215 million annually in debt-servicing costs. Analysts suggest this decision could pave the way for other debt-stressed African nations to align more closely with China. The original loans from China Exim Bank in 2014-2015 funded the Standard Gauge Railway. While new terms were not fully disclosed, the deal is anticipated to halve interest rates from the previous 6.37% under the dollar-denominated agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe flooding and landslides caused by heavy rainfall in southeastern Mexico have killed at least 41 people across five states, with 27 still missing. Thousands of soldiers have been deployed for emergency relief, as 34,000 houses, hospitals, schools, and critical infrastructure were damaged. Some communities are cut off, and power outages affect 320,000 people. The heavy rains, partly due to tropical cyclones Priscilla and Raymond, are expected to continue, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK will revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on Sunday, October 26, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST). This annual shift, which gives most people an extra hour, has been a tradition for over a century since Germany first adopted Daylight Saving Time in 1916. While some argue for permanent BST to boost productivity and reduce accidents, critics point to gloomier winter mornings, particularly in Scotland, as a major drawback, reigniting a perennial debate.</p>

          <p>Thirty beluga whales at Canada's Marineland face potential euthanasia after the park's permit to sell them to China was denied and it claims inability to afford their care. Marineland, with a history of animal mistreatment and financial issues, has seen 20 whales die since 2019. Animal welfare advocates and officials are seeking solutions, but options are limited, with a Nova Scotia sanctuary not ready until next summer. Critics, including a former trainer, believe the euthanasia threat is a "bluster" to secure government funding.</p>

          <p>Women who have experienced baby loss are challenging Meta over its targeted advertising, which continues to display pregnancy-related ads after their miscarriages. Sammi Claxon and Rhiannon Lawson describe the ads as devastating and isolating, prompting Sammi to leave social media. Tanya O'Carroll's lawsuit led Meta to agree to stop using her personal data for direct marketing, a unique outcome for a UK user. Despite user complaints, Meta's systems for opting out of sensitive ad categories are criticized as ineffective, with a former employee stating the "mark as spam" button was often disconnected.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has laid off over 100 employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the nation's main mental health agency, amidst the ongoing government shutdown. These cuts are part of a wider reduction in force across federal agencies, with SAMHSA already having lost a third of its staff earlier in the year. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the cuts, linking them to the "Democrat-led government shutdown" and the administration's "Make America Healthy Again agenda," raising concerns about public health capacity.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing a surge in common colds, flu, and Covid-19, leading to widespread illness. Experts attribute this to increased indoor mixing as children return to school and adults to work, creating ideal conditions for respiratory viruses. While Rhinovirus (common cold) is currently most prevalent, Covid-19 variants and an early uptick in flu cases are also circulating. Public health officials advise vaccination for eligible individuals and basic hygiene, noting that current illness levels are not unusually high but emphasize protecting vulnerable populations.</p>

A federal health official confirmed that notices for these employees, including staff for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, would "eventually" be rescinded. While these specific layoffs were errors, hundreds of other HHS employees will still lose their jobs.
