        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three California vehicle emissions waivers, a move Democrats are decrying as a 'nuclear option.' These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act permits them to overturn agency rules, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board, which designed the regulations, asserts that the state has never had a waiver revoked in 50 years and will sue if Congress proceeds with the revocation. The outcome could impact 16 other states and D.C. that have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas 4Â°C warmer than normal, creating a marine heatwave. This phenomenon, most intense off the west coast of Ireland, is attributed to climate change and a warm spring. Scientists are monitoring the potential impact on marine life, including disruptions to breeding patterns and influxes of jellyfish and harmful algae. While the temperatures haven't exceeded tolerance limits for most species, the long duration of the heatwave is unusual and concerning. Higher sea temperatures could also influence land temperatures through sea breezes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's offer of expedited refugee status to Afrikaners claiming violence and discrimination in South Africa has sparked debate. While some Afrikaners claim a 'White genocide' is occurring, others within the community dispute this. An Afrikaner commentator notes that Whites remain economically strong in South Africa, holding a disproportionate amount of wealth and positions of power. South African police data indicates that the majority of people murdered on farms are Black laborers, not White farmers. Some Afrikaners acknowledge that violent attacks on farmers occur, particularly near impoverished areas, but dismiss claims of a deliberate effort to seize White-owned land without compensation.</p>

          <p>Food banks in South Florida are experiencing the impact of federal funding cuts to USDA programs. These cuts, amounting to 40% of Feeding South Florida's budget, reduce the ability of food banks to purchase food directly from local farmers and producers. The CEO of Feeding South Florida reports empty racks and increased demand from families. Farmers are also affected, as they lack funds to process surplus produce for distribution to those in need.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration violated a court order by deporting a group of migrants after giving them insufficient notice and potentially to countries not their own. The deportees, from various countries, were reportedly told they were being sent to South Sudan, a country plagued by violence, but were later found to have landed in Djibouti. The judge has demanded a list of names of everyone involved in the operation and has ordered that the men be provided with legal representation and interviews to assess their fears of being sent to dangerous countries. The incident marks one of the strongest judicial rebukes against the administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South Africa's president, falsely accusing the government of seizing land from white farmers without compensation. He has also supported the use of eminent domain in the United States, particularly for the construction of the border wall. The article highlights the hypocrisy of Trump's stance, as he has previously pushed to take land from private citizens for his own projects. The contrasting views reveal a selective concern for human rights and a willingness to use government power when it suits his interests.</p>

          <p>Tech and music industry leaders testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, advocating for the passage of the No Fakes Act to protect against AI-generated deepfakes. They emphasized the need to safeguard individuals' voices and likenesses from unauthorized replication, while still allowing for responsible use of AI technology. The No Fakes Act would hold individuals or companies liable for producing unauthorized digital replicas and establish a process for removing deepfakes from online platforms. The testimony follows President Trump's signing of the Take It Down Act, which addresses non-consensual intimate imagery and deepfakes.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers have advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, though it doesn't expand access or include exceptions for rape or incest. The bill specifies that doctors won't face criminal charges for abortions in medical emergencies causing major bodily impairment and defines 'life-threatening' conditions. While supporters say it avoids confusion among doctors, critics argue it doesn't go far enough and won't change the broad understanding that abortions are illegal in Texas. The bill highlights the challenges of navigating medical exceptions under abortion bans.</p>
