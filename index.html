          <p>Amid ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, approximately 700 Marines have been activated and deployed to join around 2,100 National Guard soldiers as part of Task Force 51. According to U.S. officials, these forces are tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel, operating under rules of force that emphasize de-escalation, and they are not authorized to patrol streets or detain rioters on behalf of the police. While carrying ammunition for self-defense, the Marines and National Guard personnel will not be using rubber bullets or pepper spray. The deployment aims to reinforce the protection of federal assets during a period of heightened tensions and demonstrations. This action comes in response to protests triggered by recent immigration enforcement activities in the city. The presence of the National Guard underscores the federal government's commitment to maintaining order and safeguarding federal interests amidst the ongoing civil unrest.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Henyard, the former Democratic "super mayor" of a Chicago suburb, invoked her Fifth Amendment right after failing to produce public records in court, leading to further legal complications. Henyard's attorney stated that she does not possess the requested documents, which prompted a judge to allow her legal team to submit an affidavit in its place. The lawsuit, filed by Edgar County Watchdogs Inc., accuses Henyard and the Village of Dolton of failing to provide financial records requested under the Freedom of Information Act. Henyard, who lost her re-election bid, faces additional scrutiny following an FBI corruption investigation and an investigation into the village's finances conducted by former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The judge is set to decide if she is to remain in contempt of court while being fined $1,000 per day.</p>

Speakers at the rally, including civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, emphasized nonviolent tactics and the importance of organizing against the perceived injustices of the immigration policies. Participants expressed concerns about the impact of the raids on immigrant communities and the presence of the National Guard in the city.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a crucial government panel that advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations. Kennedy stated that this action is necessary to restore public trust in vaccine science, alleging that the committee has been plagued with conflicts of interest and has become a rubber stamp for any vaccine. The ACIP members are independent medical and public experts who make recommendations based on scientific review and evidence. This decision follows Kennedy's moves to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S., raising concerns among health policy experts.</p>
