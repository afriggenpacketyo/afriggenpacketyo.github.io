          <p>China is allowing Indian pilgrims to visit Tibet again after a five-year suspension due to COVID-19 and border tensions, a move some hope will ease strained relations between the two countries. The pilgrimages, involving treks to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, are significant to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Bon followers. This year, over 5,500 people applied, with 750 selected to travel between June and August. Yang Yabo from the Tibet Academy of Social Sciences suggests these pilgrimages have historically helped stabilize China-India relations during crises, providing a positive step towards improved diplomacy in the region.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft resigned as a government whip due to disagreements over planned cuts to disability benefits.

          <p>A federal appeals court has extended a block on a judge's order, allowing President Trump to continue deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Trump, stating he likely lawfully exercised his authority under Title 10, which allows federalizing the National Guard in cases of rebellion or inability to enforce U.S. laws. The court noted instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents as justification for the deployment. The decision enables roughly 4,000 National Guard troops to remain in Los Angeles, protecting federal property and assisting immigration agents during enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company known for its Labubu dolls, experienced a decline after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its China and Hong Kong focus list. The stock had previously seen significant gains this year, driven by the popularity of its "blind box" concept, but analysts suggested that the market may have already factored in Pop Mart's exponential growth. Despite the removal from the focus list, Morgan Stanley had previously raised its price target on the toy company, anticipating continued long-term growth. Pop Mart has been rapidly expanding overseas, establishing online sales platforms and physical stores in various countries.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, maintained its benchmark lending rates, holding the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision follows recent monetary easing measures and a trade deal with the U.S., which has alleviated some growth concerns. The trade truce between the U.S. and China has provided Beijing with more flexibility to support its currency and address economic challenges. Analysts suggest that Chinese authorities may adopt a more restrained approach to interest rate cuts, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized "ongoing efforts to erase history" during a Juneteenth event at a Texas church, seemingly referencing President Trump's policies. Biden highlighted the importance of remembering the history of slavery and recognized the significance of Juneteenth as a federal holiday. He also pointed to efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate officers, contrasting his administration's actions with those seeking to reinstate the old names. Several speakers acknowledged Biden's role in making Juneteenth a national holiday.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a spike of 101.7% year over year. This surge follows similar increases in previous months, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7%, the highest since January 2023, driven significantly by rising food costs. The government's efforts to reduce rice prices could potentially boost household spending if these reductions extend to processed foods and restaurant prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices rose 3.7% in May, marking the biggest increase in over two years, driven by surging rice and food costs. The increase has kept the inflation rate above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Food prices, excluding fresh items, increased significantly, with rice prices more than doubling due to a supply shortage. Analysts expect rice prices to decline when the new harvest enters circulation, potentially easing pressure on consumer prices.</p>
