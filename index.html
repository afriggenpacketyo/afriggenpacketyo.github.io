        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul, following calls from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. The European leaders, including representatives from the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, had visited Kyiv to pressure Russia to commit to an unconditional ceasefire starting the following Monday, threatening new sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if the ceasefire was not agreed to. Putin's statement indicated a willingness for serious negotiations but did not directly address the ceasefire demand, stating that the talks should aim to eliminate the root causes of the conflict, and did not rule out the possibility of new truces being agreed upon.</p>

Other stories include an exclusive interview with Danny Dyer about his time on EastEnders and speculation about the cast of the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing.

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva to continue high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from the trade war initiated by President Trump, who has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. These punitive levies are disrupting global supply chains and economists warn that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially tipping the United States into a recession. The talks are intended to set the stage for broader economic negotiations, though economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful and unrealistic. She suggests that being flawed is an essential part of a mother's role, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross highlights the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, urging a shift towards recognizing the credit mothers deserve. She encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and stop striving for an unattainable ideal.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has reiterated his goal to eliminate all tariffs in trade negotiations with the United States. Speaking on a Fuji Television morning program, Ishiba acknowledged positive discussions with the US, but emphasized that Japan should aim for zero percent tariffs, even as Washington agreed with London on a baseline 10% tariff for car exports. Ishiba argued that high auto import levies would make cars more expensive for U.S. consumers and that lowering those tariffs would benefit the American economy. He also expressed caution about a potential reduction in consumption tax to support the domestic economy.</p>

While opposition parties support a tax cut ahead of the upcoming election, Ishiba suggests exploring alternative ways to support those in need. He also reiterated his government's aim to abolish tariffs on Japanese exports during negotiations with the United States, noting that while a 10% tariff rate may be acceptable for some countries, Japan is seeking complete elimination.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that the United States and China have made "great progress" in high-level trade talks in Geneva. The meeting marked the first face-to-face contact between senior officials since the U.S. increased tariffs on goods from China to at least 145 percent. Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs to 80 percent if China makes concessions, but White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt clarified that any move would require reciprocal action from China.</p>

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is relocating to Canada due to the economic impact of tariffs and strained relations between the U.S. and Canada. The museum, which relies heavily on Canadian tourists, has seen a significant drop in business since President Trump imposed tariffs on goods from China and Canada. Owners Neil and Krystal King cited the instability and economic uncertainty caused by the tariffs as the primary reason for moving their business across the border. The museum will reopen in Canada this summer.</p>
