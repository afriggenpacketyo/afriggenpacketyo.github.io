          <p>Australians cast their ballots in a general election amidst a backdrop of economic challenges, including inflation and a housing crisis, compounded by a volatile international environment. Voters express concerns about the rising cost of living and question whether either major party offers substantial solutions. The article notes a shift away from the dominant Labor and Conservative parties towards independent candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with mainstream politics. Australia's compulsory voting system ensures broad participation, but the election's outcome remains uncertain as voters seek deeper solutions to pressing issues.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Colorado, Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The suit argues that these policies obstruct federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, citing an apartment complex in Aurora purportedly taken over by a Venezuelan gang as an example. Local officials dispute the extent of the gang's control but acknowledge issues at the complex. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate state and city laws that prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, asserting federal authority over immigration matters.</p>

          <p>The United States has implemented a 25% tariff on imported car parts, impacting an industry already navigating complex policy changes. While the measure aims to encourage domestic manufacturing, analysts foresee higher costs for businesses and consumers. Automakers are reporting increased sales due to concerns about future price hikes, but also warn of substantial new costs resulting from the tariffs. Some companies are withdrawing financial guidance due to the uncertain economic landscape, although certain exemptions have been made for parts from Canada and Mexico.</p>

          <p>The elimination of a tariff exemption for inexpensive goods entering the U.S. is expected to negatively impact advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. This exemption had fueled the growth of online retailers like Temu and Shein, which spent heavily on digital advertising to attract American shoppers. Temu has already ceased direct shipments from China, transitioning to local warehouses, while Shein has not yet responded.

          <h2>Rising Numbers of Autism Diagnoses Prompt Questions and Debate</h2>

          <p>The increasing number of autism diagnoses has led to discussions about what defines autism and whether there are genuinely more autistic individuals. The definition of autism has evolved, now encompassing a wider range of traits and experiences, particularly among women and adults. While some view the rise in diagnoses as a positive step towards greater awareness and support, others express concerns about the potential for overdiagnosis and misrepresentation. This has brought tensions over who owns the word and what it means.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Cut EPA Staffing to Levels Seen During Reagan Era</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:15:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration plans to reorganize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cutting staffing levels to those seen during the Reagan era. This will involve significant cuts in the agency's scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The EPA expects to cut staff to levels similar to the 1980s, in order to "operate as efficiently and effectively as possible." Some scientific staff will be moved into policy-making offices, while others will be sent to newly created offices.</p>

          <h2>Sycamore Gap Trial: Key Evidence Presented in Court</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:14:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree has revealed key evidence, including video footage, a missing wedge of wood, and cell phone tracking data. Prosecutors allege that Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers carried out the "moronic mission" overnight on 27 September 2023. The prosecution say that while one felled the tree with a chainsaw, the other filmed it on Mr Graham's phone. The court has heard how the pair swapped screenshots of social media posts and press reports on their phones, but their close friendship would unravel as the "public revulsion became clear to them".</p>
