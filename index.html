          <h2>US Government Reports Unexpected Budget Surplus in June Driven by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:46:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced an unexpected government surplus of over $27 billion for June, a significant shift from May's $316 billion deficit. This positive turn was largely fueled by a 13% year-over-year increase in receipts, with customs duties surging by 301% compared to the previous year following new tariffs. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.34 trillion, and net interest on the national debt continues to be a major expense, totaling $84 billion for the month.

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two co-defendants. The 2-1 decision upholds the Defense Secretary's authority to block the deal, which would have removed the death penalty in exchange for life sentences. This ruling marks a setback in the long-stalled military prosecution at Guantánamo Bay, sending the case back to the military commission. The court determined the government had the right to withdraw from the agreement as its terms had not yet been fulfilled.</p>

          <p>President Trump traveled to Central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that occurred on July 4, resulting in at least 121 deaths and over 170 people still missing. The visit focused on Kerrville, the area most affected, where a girls' summer camp suffered devastating losses. As search and recovery operations continue with drones and rescue teams, the president met with first responders and local officials. A federal disaster declaration has been signed to provide FEMA support for the ongoing relief efforts in the flood-ravaged region.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, including the 7/7 London bombings and the controversial shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, for which the force was later found to have breached health and safety laws. Lord Blair, who joined the Met in 1974, rose through the ranks and led major investigations before becoming commissioner.

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting the agency to consider asking laid-off staff to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic review processes implemented by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which have stalled funding for programs like services for unaccompanied migrant children and youth homelessness. With the fiscal year ending soon, there are concerns that the department may have to rush the award process, potentially compromising proper oversight.</p>

          <h2>Experts Examine the Science Behind the 10,000-Steps-a-Day Fitness Goal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely accepted fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number itself is somewhat arbitrary, health experts note that it coincidentally aligns with public health guidelines for physical activity, equating to about five miles of walking. Recent studies suggest health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts like 2,500 to 3,000 per day, with significant gains plateauing around 7,500 steps. The consensus is that any movement is beneficial, and using the goal as a motivator is positive.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Warn of Worsening Measles Outbreak as Summer Travel Increases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is currently experiencing its most severe measles outbreak in over three decades, with more cases reported in 2025 than in any year since 1992. Experts attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates and anticipate that summer travel will further accelerate the spread of the highly contagious disease. The rise in cases, which has already resulted in three deaths, highlights growing concerns about a potential "post-herd immunity" era following disruptions in routine childhood immunizations. Health officials are urging the public to ensure their MMR vaccinations are up to date to prevent further illness.</p>

          <p>A collection of recent essays in The Atlantic challenges the traditional notion of American exceptionalism by drawing parallels between U.S. events and historical developments in other nations. One piece connects the seizure of children during Argentina's Dirty War to modern U.S. immigration policies, warning that authoritarian actions can happen anywhere. Another essay highlights how democratic principles like birthright citizenship were pioneered in Latin America, suggesting the U.S. has as much to learn from its neighbors as it has to teach. The articles collectively argue for a more global perspective, acknowledging both shared vulnerabilities and opportunities for learning.</p>

          <p>A new analysis identifies the most expensive states to live in for 2025, with California ranking as the costliest in the nation. The rankings consider factors like the price of goods and services, housing affordability, and homeowner's insurance costs, which are surging in many areas due to climate-related risks. States such as Hawaii, Florida, and Colorado also feature prominently on the list due to high housing costs and insurance premiums. The report underscores how inflation and other economic pressures vary significantly by location, impacting household budgets across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that COVID-19 cases are now on the rise in half of U.S. states, signaling the start of a potential summer wave. While national activity is still considered "low," wastewater data and emergency room visits show upticks, particularly in the Southeast, Southern, and West Coast states. A recent CDC analysis suggests the virus has settled into a pattern of biannual surges, typically peaking in late summer and again in winter. This pattern is expected to continue as long as the virus continues its rapid evolution.</p>

          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, this article outlines four potential relief options. These include credit counseling, which can lead to a structured debt management plan with lower interest rates, and credit card debt forgiveness, where a lump-sum payment can settle a debt for less than the full amount. The article also discusses credit card hardship programs, which may offer temporary relief like paused payments, and bankruptcy as a last resort for overwhelming debt. Each strategy comes with its own set of qualifications and potential consequences for one's credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a bill repealing a voter-approved law that guaranteed paid sick leave and inflation-adjusted minimum wage increases, a measure that had passed just eight months prior. The repeal, which takes effect in August, is a significant win for business groups who argued the law was a "job killer" and imposed burdensome mandates. Workers' rights advocates, who had campaigned extensively for the original ballot initiative, condemned the move as a betrayal of the families who need the benefit. Supporters of the original law are now considering a new ballot initiative to reinstate the provisions.</p>

          <p>A new pilot project in England will allow general practitioner (GP) surgeries to offer patients services like career coaching and exercise classes to help them return to work more quickly. The goal is to reduce the number of "fit notes" that declare people unfit for work by providing proactive support. The government is funding the initiative in 15 regions, aiming to change the focus from what patients cannot do to how they can be supported. The scheme is part of a broader government effort to decrease the number of people out of the workforce due to long-term health conditions.</p>

This public rejection follows U.S. efforts to press African nations to accept third-country nationals, backed by threats of visa restrictions and tariffs. The stance comes shortly after the U.S. imposed new, stricter visa rules on citizens from Nigeria and other African nations.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise new album titled "Swag," his first in four years, but it has been met with lukewarm reviews from music critics. While some praised moments of nostalgic, R&B-influenced sound, many found the project lyrically weak and self-pitying, particularly its spoken-word interludes about the pressures of fame. Publications like The Guardian and The Telegraph gave it two or three stars, describing it as an "uncomfortable cry for help" rather than a triumphant return for the pop superstar. The album features collaborations with several rappers and addresses themes of fatherhood, marriage, and faith.</p>
