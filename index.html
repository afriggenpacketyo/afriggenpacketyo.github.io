          <h2>President Trump's Scotland Visit Focuses on Unfinished UK-US Trade Deal Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:43:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland is strategically aimed at cementing warm ties with the UK and addressing unresolved aspects of a recent trade deal. Key discussions involve the potential removal of a 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum, provided British steel is domestically sourced, and the US push to eliminate the UK's digital services tax impacting tech companies. While the initial deal commenced in June, certain commitments remain in negotiation. Analysts suggest this meeting could yield positive headline announcements, improving UK-US relations within the context of an August 1 global trade deadline.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is maintaining a steadfast posture as a crucial August 1 trade deadline with the U.S. looms, potentially triggering increased tariffs. This confidence stems partly from its recently finalized "historic" trade deal with the UK, which successfully protected India's sensitive agricultural sectors, signaling its intent to trade on its own terms. The U.S. has strategic reasons to secure a deal, seeing India as a vital partner to counterbalance China's global manufacturing dominance and influence in the Indo-Pacific. India's multi-alignment strategy, including its BRICS role, provides significant leverage, enabling it to pursue diversified trade agreements and mitigate global economic shocks.</p>

          <h2>Volkswagen Lowers Profit Outlook Due to Impact of US Tariffs and EV Transition Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:34:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automotive giant Volkswagen has significantly lowered its full-year guidance and reported a 29% decrease in second-quarter operating profit, attributing the decline largely to the disruptive impact of US import tariffs. The company also cited substantial restructuring costs and the inherently lower profit margins of its expanding electric vehicle (EV) production as contributing factors. Volkswagen anticipates the continuation of 27.5% US import tariffs throughout the second half of the year, underscoring high uncertainty in global trade policy. Despite these financial headwinds, the article notes strong product success in both combustion engine and EV segments, alongside robust order intake in Western Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Puma's shares experienced an 18% decline following the German sportswear brand's announcement of worse-than-expected second-quarter sales and a significant cut to its full-year guidance. The company explicitly attributed this revised outlook to the substantial impact of US trade tariffs, anticipating a low-double digit percentage sales decrease and an operating profit loss for 2025. This marks a dramatic shift from previous forecasts of profit growth. Puma also highlighted ongoing volatile geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, muted brand momentum, and elevated inventory levels as contributing factors. The article underscores the direct negative financial consequence of tariffs, estimating an €80 million impact on 2025 gross profit, alongside sales drops in key markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes experienced a 0.9% increase in June, largely attributed to the unusually hot weather, which significantly boosted fuel and supermarket sales. The Office for National Statistics reported a rise in drink purchases at supermarkets, alongside increased fuel sales as consumers ventured out in the sunshine. However, this modest rebound followed a substantial 2.8% decline in May, which was revised to be worse than initially estimated, and June's rise still fell short of many economists' forecasts. Overall, the article highlights a loss of momentum in retail spending, with sales up by a mere 0.2% over the April-June quarter, consistent with broader indicators of weakening consumer confidence.</p>

However, the British Medical Association warns that this strategy could dangerously overstretch remaining staff, asserting that ministers had ample opportunity to avert the walkout.

          <p>The United States has abruptly concluded Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar, recalling its negotiating team and accusing Hamas of demonstrating a lack of "good faith" in the ongoing truce discussions. Special envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Hamas's latest response indicated an unwillingness to reach an agreement, prompting the US to explore "alternative options" for securing hostage releases and fostering a more stable environment in Gaza. Hamas, in turn, expressed surprise at Witkoff's negative remarks, asserting its flexibility and commitment to achieving a deal that ends the aggression. This development represents a significant setback for the Trump administration's peacemaking endeavors amidst the deteriorating humanitarian crisis and escalating international pressure for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley expresses feeling "refreshed and recharged" as he enters his fourth season, despite mounting pressure to elevate the team's performance following a disappointing 7-6 record. He credits this renewed vigor partly to the new general manager, Chad Bowden, and his front office, who have largely taken personnel matters off Riley's plate. While acknowledging existing challenges, such as an unproven quarterback and an inexperienced offensive line, Riley views the program as having progressed beyond major structural issues to focusing on "finishes." He highlights significant improvements in defensive depth and talent, expressing confidence in the team's overall trajectory and the momentum generated by a top recruiting class.</p>

The long-standing territorial dispute erupted into severe fighting near two ancient temples along their shared frontier, with both nations accusing each other of initiating the use of heavy artillery and rockets. Thailand has reported 14 fatalities on its side and the evacuation of over 100,000 residents from border provinces, while Cambodia confirmed one civilian death and five injuries. The conflict, rooted in contested border areas and previously active between 2008 and 2011, has prompted international calls for immediate de-escalation and dialogue from major powers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a new executive order aimed at fundamentally reshaping college sports, granting federal agencies authority to enforce new provisions concerning athletic scholarships and name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to safeguard non-revenue women's and Olympic sports by mandating that the highest-earning athletic departments maintain specific scholarship numbers. It also targets "pay-for-play" NIL arrangements, deeming them inappropriate, while permitting deals that reflect "fair market value." This executive action follows a class-action settlement that opened the door for direct payments to athletes, intensifying anxieties about resource allocation within collegiate athletics. Legal experts, however, question the order's immediate binding power, viewing it primarily as a signal of escalating federal involvement.</p>

FCC head Brendan Carr welcomed Skydance's commitments, including an ombudsman for unbiased journalism and ending diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The 2-1 vote, with Democratic dissent, sparked criticism regarding the timing and perceived political influence on the regulatory decision, highlighting concerns over media independence and corporate capitulation.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, directly challenging its sanctuary city laws in the wake of an incident where an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot by an alleged undocumented immigrant. Homeland Security officials, including border czar Tom Homan, vehemently criticized these policies, asserting that sanctuary cities effectively serve as havens for criminals. The lawsuit explicitly claims that New York City's provisions intentionally obstruct federal immigration law enforcement by hindering essential communication between federal and local authorities. While the New York Immigration Coalition defends sanctuary policies as vital for ensuring all residents, regardless of immigration status, feel safe reporting crimes, the DOJ maintains these laws compromise public safety.</p>
