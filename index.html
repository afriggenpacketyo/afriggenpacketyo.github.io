        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop after its first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. The company's revenue reached $2.24 billion, a 28% increase from the previous year, while profits attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million. These figures missed LSEG estimates due to production fluctuations, leading to decreased average selling prices. SMIC anticipates a sequential revenue decline of 4% to 6% in the current quarter, with gross margin expected to fall. The company's capacity utilization reached 89.6%, driven by strong domestic demand and government policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods as high-level trade officials from both nations prepared for talks in Switzerland. Trump noted that tariffs could not go any higher than the current 145% imposed on China. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying expressed confidence in Beijing's ability to manage trade issues with the US. Analysts suggest that economic pressures on both sides are driving a transactional de-escalation, though systemic frictions between the US and China are expected to persist. The initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng.</p>

          <p>New soil testing by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has revealed high levels of lead and other toxic metals at homesites previously cleared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after January's wildfires. In the Eaton burn scar, 27% of soil samples from scraped areas and nearly 44% from unscraped areas exceeded California's lead standards for residential properties. County officials recommend that property owners consider soil contamination assessments before rebuilding. This revelation adds to growing concerns about the effectiveness of federal cleanup efforts and the potential health risks posed by remaining contaminants.</p>

          <p>An ex-model testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, recounting a sexual assault she alleges occurred when she was 16. Kaja Sokola stated that Weinstein ordered her to remove her blouse, touched her inappropriately, and instructed her to remain silent about the incident. Weinstein is facing charges related to a separate incident four years later, where he allegedly forced Ms. Sokola to perform oral sex on him after arranging for her to be an extra in a film. Weinstein denies sexually assaulting anyone, and his retrial follows the overturning of his previous conviction last year. The claims against Weinstein were a catalyst for the #MeToo movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports to the U.S. fell by over 21% year-on-year, while imports dropped nearly 14%. Exports to ASEAN countries jumped 20.8%, and exports to the EU rose 8.3%. Analysts suggest the overall export surge may be partly attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were implemented. The Chinese government is encouraging exporters to shift sales to the domestic market, potentially exacerbating deflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's skepticism towards offshore wind power has led to an indefinite halt to construction on projects like Empire Wind off Long Island, causing concern in the European wind industry. The pause has prompted companies like Welcon and Vestas to reassess their approach to renewable energy, with Europe expected to compensate for the pullback in the United States. Despite the setback, European executives remain optimistic about the growth of offshore wind in Europe, projecting it will constitute a significant portion of the continent's electric power generation by 2050.

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, potentially lowering tariffs and delivering a political victory for Prime Minister Starmer. The deal includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products, and a reduction in non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports will remain in place, with some exemptions for British automakers. Commerce Secretary Lutnick estimates the deal will generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. The agreement is seen as a vindication of Starmer's approach to Mr. Trump.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a missile test aimed at enhancing the military's nuclear counterattack capabilities, according to state media. The drill involved the operation of a 600-millimeter multilayer rocket system and the Hwasongpho-11-Ka tactical ballistic missile. The test follows detections of multiple ballistic missiles launched toward the Sea of Japan by South Korea and Japan. Kim emphasized the need to bolster the readiness of the country's nuclear forces and accused the U.S. and its allies of escalating tensions through military drills.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year in April, defying US President Trump's tariff increases. The figure exceeded market expectations and followed a 12.4% rise in March. Analysts suggest the resilience may be due to transshipment through other countries and pre-tariff trade contracts. Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with duties of up to 125% on American goods. The data potentially strengthens China's negotiating position ahead of trade talks with the US in Switzerland.</p>

An audit revealed that nearly 40% of evidence bags and a third of firearms were not properly documented. The town's government disbanded the police department and plans to rebuild it from scratch.
