          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by George H.W. Bush, passed away at 85. Souter, despite being a Republican appointee, became a consistent member of the court's liberal wing, often frustrating Republicans with his alignment with liberal justices on key issues. He played a crucial role in reaffirming Roe v. Wade and dissenting in Bush v. Gore. After retiring in 2009, Souter returned to his home state of New Hampshire but continued to serve on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, leaving a legacy of judicial independence and intellectual rigor.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested he's considering lowering tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade talks in Switzerland, a decrease from the current 145% but still higher than desired by some. This move comes as the U.S. seeks to renegotiate trade deals, with China being a key focus. The U.S. exported $143.5 billion in goods to China in 2024, while importing $438.9 billion, highlighting the importance of this trade relationship.</p>

Baldwin claims the scrutiny left her physically ill with stress and brought her children to tears, as she felt Schumer was inherently cruel. Schumer previously poked fun at Baldwin's heritage in a Netflix special, questioning Baldwin's accent and Spanish-sounding names, alluding to the controversy surrounding Baldwin's claims of Spanish heritage. Baldwin has since apologized for the confusion and admitted culture can be fluid.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a limited trade agreement that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. However, many UK goods will still be subject to Trump's 10% import tariff. The agreement also includes pharmaceuticals and a digital trade deal, but food standards will remain unchanged.</p>

The government insists that existing food standards will not change and that border checks will be implemented to ensure compliance. This assurance comes amid concerns from farmers and consumers about the potential influx of hormone-treated beef from the US, a practice banned in the UK since 1989. The trade deal allows for increased beef imports from the US up to 13,000 metric tonnes tariff-free, in exchange for similar access for UK beef in the US market.</p>

The US-UK deal, which maintains Washington’s 10% tariffs on imports from Britain while increasing agricultural access and easing duties on UK car shipments, is seen as largely symbolic. Experts suggest that China's approach to negotiations will remain unchanged, irrespective of the US-UK agreement.</p>

Twain, in reality, was gullible, emotionally immature, and prone to financial scams, leading to a series of personal tribulations and family tragedies. Despite his ability to depict the frailties of others, Twain struggled to correct them in himself, making his life a stark contrast to his work. The biography delves into his financial misadventures, family losses, and complex relationship with the South, painting a portrait of a man who found riches but struggled to find happiness.</p>

          <p>The first Chinese freight ships carrying goods subject to President Trump's tariffs have arrived at U.S. ports, with over 12,000 shipping containers affected. Companies such as Amazon, Home Depot, and Ikea have goods on these vessels, facing the newly imposed tariffs. The tariffs have led to confusion and uncertainty for businesses, causing them to continually adjust their plans. Trump suggested he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, but that number is still prohibitive to trade.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to a preliminary trade deal, reducing tariffs on British-made cars and eliminating duties on steel and aluminum.

The UK has agreed to cut tariffs on US ethanol, while maintaining its ban on US chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Outstanding issues on pharmaceuticals, food standards, and digital services tax will need to be resolved.</p>
