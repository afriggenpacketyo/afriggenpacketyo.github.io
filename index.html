          <p>Palantir has seen its valuation surge past $430 billion, driven by its AI-powered software and significant government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military. The company recently reported its first quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, with U.S. government revenue growing 53% and now accounting for 55% of the total. Despite a decline in international commercial revenue, strong retail investor interest and major defense contracts have propelled the stock to new highs. The article notes that investors are paying a significant premium, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of most tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, held a virtual meeting with House Democrats to discuss strategies against Republican-led redistricting efforts. The main focus was on a controversial Texas map that could significantly increase the GOP's congressional majority, a move Democrats have labeled as a gerrymandering scheme. The situation has escalated, with Texas Democrats leaving the state to prevent a vote and California's governor threatening retaliatory redistricting. The discussion highlights a deepening national political conflict over electoral maps ahead of midterm elections.</p>

She developed the concept at a school engineering club, which was then transformed into a working prototype by the firm Thales and distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was also immortalized as a mini-figure.

Wang, who was posthumously accepted into the class, died while holding a door open for other students to escape the gunman. Following an inquiry from CBS News, his classmates nominated him for the Honorary Graduate Award, recognizing his embodiment of West Point's values of duty, honor, and country. The act ensures that Wang's story of selfless sacrifice will be remembered by the newly commissioned Army officers.</p>

          <p>The European Union has dispatched two firefighting planes to Spain after the country activated the bloc's disaster assistance mechanism for the first time to combat severe wildfires. The death toll from the fires has risen to three, including two volunteer firefighters, amid an ongoing heatwave with temperatures reaching up to 44C. Thousands have been evacuated, and authorities have arrested ten people on suspicion of arson. These events are part of a broader crisis in Southern Europe, with Greece, Bulgaria, and other nations also requesting EU aid as climate change exacerbates wildfire conditions.</p>

          <p>An inquest jury has concluded that 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz was unlawfully killed at the Huntercombe Hospital, a mental health facility near Maidenhead, in 2022. Ruth, who was supposed to be under constant supervision, was left alone for 15 minutes by a staff member working with fraudulent credentials, during which time she self-harmed and was later found unconscious. The jury cited insufficient staff training and unsuitable care as contributing factors to her death. Her parents hope sharing her story will force necessary changes in children's mental health services.</p>

          <p>As high interest rates persist, consumers with significant credit card debt are considering options like debt forgiveness and debt management for relief. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, which can save money but severely damages one's credit score and may result in a tax liability. Conversely, debt management, typically done through a credit counseling agency, structures a full repayment plan with lower interest rates, preserving and eventually improving credit. The article suggests the best choice depends on an individual's financial hardship, income stability, and long-term credit goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Beyond is pivoting towards simpler, 'cleaner' ingredients and even dropping 'meat' from its name, aiming to appeal to health-conscious consumers wary of processed foods. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on mimicking the taste and experience of conventional meat, launching more 'indulgent' products and embracing a meatier brand identity.

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose by 0.9% in July, significantly exceeding economists' forecasts and marking the largest monthly jump in over three years. This surge suggests that President Trump's tariffs are increasing the cost of imported goods, with businesses potentially starting to pass these costs on to consumers. The unexpected increase complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, as a rate cut could further fuel inflation. This data indicates that despite recent stable consumer prices, inflationary pressures are building within the supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Justice Department employee, identified as Sean Charles Dunn, has been fired after being charged with assaulting a federal law-enforcement official in Washington, D.C. A viral video showed Dunn berating a group of Customs and Border Protection agents before allegedly throwing a sandwich at one of them. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the termination on social media, stating such disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated. The incident occurred amidst a surge in federal law enforcement patrols in the capital, highlighting ongoing political tensions.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed two warships, the USS Higgins and USS Cincinnati, to the vicinity of Scarborough Shoal in the disputed South China Sea. The deployment follows an incident where a Chinese navy destroyer and a coast guard ship collided while attempting to block a smaller Philippine vessel. Washington condemned the 'reckless action by China,' while Beijing blamed the Philippines for intruding in the area. This U.S. 'freedom-of-navigation' operation highlights escalating tensions and the potential for miscalculation in the highly contested maritime region.</p>

The deal, which also featured Ulta products on Target's website, was once touted as a key driver of store traffic for the big-box retailer. The dissolution of the popular collaboration could present another challenge for Target as it struggles with declining sales and foot traffic. An analyst suggested that operational issues at Target, including theft and staffing, may have contributed to the decision to end the relationship.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has advanced plans to build over 3,000 homes in the highly controversial E1 settlement area of the occupied West Bank. He stated the project, which has been frozen for decades due to international opposition, would effectively 'bury the idea of a Palestinian state' by cutting off the West Bank from occupied East Jerusalem. The move comes as several European countries have announced intentions to recognize a Palestinian state. The plan has been condemned by Palestinian officials and Israeli NGO Peace Now as a deepening of annexation.</p>

Despite Trump's campaign pledge to end the war quickly, multiple rounds of talks have failed, and the White House has described this meeting as a 'listening exercise.'

          <p>This analysis argues that the recent political interference at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) risks undermining public trust in crucial economic data, regardless of whether the numbers are actually manipulated. The firing of the previous commissioner and the nomination of a partisan successor erodes the agency's reputation for independence, which is vital for its function. The article suggests this loss of confidence could be self-fulfilling, as declining public and business participation in BLS surveys, a pre-existing trend, may worsen.
