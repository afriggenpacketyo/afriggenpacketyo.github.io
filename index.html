          <p>Costa Rican police seized crack cocaine, marijuana, knives, and five capybaras after a high-speed chase. The two men in the vehicle, both with criminal records, were arrested and the capybaras were turned over to the National System of Conservation Areas. Security Minister Mario Zamora noted the incident highlights the intersection of drug trafficking and the introduction of non-native species. This marks the first recorded case of illegal capybara trafficking in Costa Rica, with the animals destined for a refuge for environmental and conservation education programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a 5% tax on remittance transfers from the U.S., primarily affecting Latin American countries. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized the proposal, arguing it amounts to double taxation. The tax, aimed at curbing illegal migration, could significantly reduce the $160 billion sent annually to Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts warn it may push transfers into informal channels and negatively impact countries heavily reliant on remittances, while also potentially alienating Latino voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

The price cap, which affects 21 million households, remains higher than previous years, leading to ongoing concerns about affordability and customer debt.

          <p>Despite reforms implemented after George Floydâ€™s murder, killings by police officers in the U.S. have risen, with officers disproportionately killing Black Americans. A New York Times article notes that states and cities enacted new policies, but these changes have had little impact on accountability or the number of killings by police. The Trump administration dropped efforts to oversee police departments, and racial disparities in police killings persist, partly due to higher crime rates in poorer minority communities. The article suggests addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, will require more than just tweaking department guidelines.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has expressed concern over the U.S. decision to revoke Harvard University's certification to accept international students and will call on the United States to minimize the impact on Japanese students. Top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi stated that the government is closely monitoring the situation, and Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said the government has asked the U.S. Embassy in Japan to provide further details to minimize the impact on Japanese students. Harvard hosts international students and scholars from over 140 countries, including 260 from Japan.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club with high-paying customers of his personal cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, promising to promote the crypto industry from the White House. The event drew protesters who condemned it as corruption, while some attendees admitted they sought to influence U.S. financial regulations. Trump criticized the Biden administration's actions against crypto companies and pledged to support the industry. The dinner, organized by Trump's business partners, was seen as a way to enrich the first family through the sale of memecoins.</p>

The mining company said that all 260 employees have been accounted for, are safe, and have been provided with food. Initial investigations indicate that a rock winder skip door opened at the loading point, causing some damage, and employees will remain at the sub-shaft station until it is safe to proceed to the surface.</p>

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems insufficient to reverse historical pay freezes. The National Education Union (NEU) may also dispute the government's funding for teachers' pay rises. The BMA argues doctors' pay is significantly lower than 16 years ago when accounting for inflation, and the government's actions have made strikes more likely. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offers as above inflation, but unions are consulting members on potential industrial action.</p>

          <p>A House Republican tax bill, called the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans through tax cuts while negatively impacting low-income households due to reductions in social safety net programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates income for the bottom tenth of households would fall, while the top 10% would see an income boost. The bill preserves a lower top tax rate and tax breaks tied to business income, state and local taxes, and the estate tax, largely benefiting high earners.</p>
