          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a prominent figure in France's women's rights movement, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband, who drugged her and invited dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her case, which resulted in the conviction of 51 men, sparked a national debate on sexual violence. Pelicot's advocacy was instrumental in a legal reform that now includes a lack of consent in the country's criminal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt against him during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He attributed his survival to divine intervention and praised the heroic actions of first responders and rally attendees who assisted the wounded. The statement also honored Corey Comperatore, a rallygoer who was killed while protecting his family. The incident continues to raise questions about Secret Service security protocols, which have since been under review.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year-over-year. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has been loosening monetary policy amid these global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, has indicated that the institution is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to slow. In an interview, Bailey stated his belief that the path for rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. This follows two previous rate cuts and a recent hold at 4.25%. The comments come as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, putting pressure on the government to stimulate growth.

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner with the second overall pick in the MLB draft, a move that aligns with their strategy of fast-tracking college talent to the major leagues. The choice is particularly poignant for Bremner, whose mother recently passed away from breast cancer, and he noted the emotional significance of being drafted by the "Angels." Bremner demonstrated remarkable resilience by continuing to pitch at a high level during his mother's illness. The Angels are hopeful that his powerful fastball and changeup will make him a key part of their future starting rotation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is considering a proposal, heavily backed by President Trump, to rescind $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds outlets like NPR and PBS. While the move is framed as targeting biased national media, over 70% of the federal funding supports local stations, many of which are in rural areas. Some Republican senators from these states, like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed opposition, warning that the cuts could eliminate vital, life-saving news and information services in communities with no other local media sources.

This shift is part of a broader trend he calls "rainbow tourism," with travelers from a more diverse range of countries exploring the globe.

          <p>A large wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The fire also burned a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighters to evacuate the area and complicated containment efforts. Meanwhile, smoke from intense Canadian wildfires is blanketing the U.S. Upper Midwest, causing unhealthy air quality across several states, including Minnesota and North Dakota. The combination of fires and smoke has led to park closures and health warnings across multiple regions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of their season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory over the San Francisco Giants, securing a 5.5-game lead in the NL West. The game reflected their season's uneven performance, with starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivering a seven-inning scoreless gem, while the bullpen later gave up the lead. Despite struggles from some veteran players and an injury-plagued pitching staff, the team has maintained the top record in the National League. Freddie Freeman drove in the go-ahead run in the 11th inning to clinch the win.</p>

          <p>After an opening loss to France, England's women's football team has built significant momentum heading into the Euro 2025 quarter-finals. The Lionesses responded to the initial setback with dominant victories over the Netherlands and Wales, scoring a combined 10 goals. Manager Sarina Wiegman believes the early loss created a sense of urgency that brought the team together and sharpened their performance. They now face a strong Swedish team in a rematch of the Euro 2022 semi-final, with players and analysts noting that England must be well-prepared for Sweden's physical, counter-attacking style.</p>

          <p>A new report from the UK's Met Office concludes that the country is experiencing a "notably different" climate compared to just a few decades ago, with extreme weather events becoming the new normal. The analysis shows that the UK is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency, experiencing more very hot days and significantly wetter winters. The warming, occurring at a rate of 0.25°C per decade, is reshaping the natural world, affecting species and increasing flood risks as sea levels rise. This evidence highlights the urgent need for the UK to adapt to the ongoing impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, long admired by some international conservatives for his "illiberal democracy" model, is facing a significant political challenge at home. A new opposition party, Tisza, led by former Orban insider Peter Magyar, has gained substantial support by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of hospitals and schools. While Orban has built his power by targeting migrants and LGBTQ rights, Magyar's center-right movement is resonating with voters concerned about corruption and the stagnating economy. This has created the most serious threat to Orban's 15-year rule ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is intensifying a long-standing water dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to the U.S., but it is currently in significant arrears. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs if Mexico does not fulfill its obligations. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot send water they don't have, while Texan farmers accuse them of hoarding water and using inefficient irrigation for water-intensive crops, threatening their own livelihoods.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain featured a pre-match and halftime show more akin to the Super Bowl than a traditional football match. The event included a military flyover, performances by Robbie Williams and Coldplay, and an on-pitch appearance by President Donald Trump, all contributing to a delayed kickoff. While Chelsea secured a decisive 3-0 victory, the off-pitch spectacle, complete with a red carpet and celebrity attendees, highlighted a significant Americanization of the global football event.

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the Trump administration's new 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a larger strategy to onshore production and reduce the U.S. trade deficit for national security reasons. When challenged that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil, Hassett argued for the necessity of an overall strategy to prevent transshipping and achieve long-term objectives. The defense comes as the administration also threatens tariffs on the EU and Mexico, with Hassett stating the tariffs are real if a satisfactory deal is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final night of Drake's residency at London's Wireless Festival ended in disappointment for many fans after his headline performance was cut short after only 40 minutes. The rapper appeared on stage earlier than scheduled and seemed to rush through his set to beat the venue's strict curfew, a problem that had also occurred on the first night. The short set and fewer special guests compared to previous nights left many attendees feeling shortchanged. The festival's conclusion was also marked by chaotic scenes at an accessible exit, where fans pleaded with security to be let out.</p>
