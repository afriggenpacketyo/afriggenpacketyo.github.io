          <p>Actor Pierce Brosnan discussed the immense responsibility he felt towards fans while starring as Ron in the film adaptation of Richard Osman's "Thursday Murder Club" series, which has sold over 10 million copies. The movie features a star-studded cast including Dame Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, and Sir Ben Kingsley, portraying a quartet of amateur sleuths in a retirement village. Despite some critics calling the adaptation "nefariously lazy" and others praising its "camp and quietly sad" tone, the cast expressed enjoyment during filming and enthusiasm for potential sequels. The film combines cozy crime with deeper themes of aging and loss, resonating with the books' blend of sadness and humane comedy.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently oversaw the test-firing of two new anti-air missile types, as reported by state media. These tests showcased the nation's growing military capabilities and coincided with ongoing joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States. The missiles are designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and cruise missiles. Kim's government has consistently dismissed calls for denuclearization talks, instead strengthening its alliance with Russia, to whom it has provided substantial military aid for the conflict in Ukraine. This strategic alignment raises concerns about potential technology transfers that could further enhance North Korea's defense systems.</p>

          <p>Emely Martinez, 35, a Florida woman, faces charges of fraud and practicing dentistry without a license for allegedly performing unauthorized dental procedures. She is accused of installing fake veneers using superglue, causing severe infections and extensive damage to her victims' teeth, necessitating costly emergency dental work. Martinez reportedly offered full-mouth veneer treatments for approximately $3,000, a fraction of the standard price. Police believe she may have also performed tooth extractions and dental work on children, and potentially used aliases and new businesses to hide her fraudulent activities. The American Dental Association has warned against such unlicensed procedures due to the risk of irreversible harm.</p>

This drawing marked the 37th consecutive occasion without a grand prize winner since the last claim in May. Despite no one matching all six numbers for the top prize, several participants achieved significant wins, including a Tennessee player who secured $2 million by matching five numbers with the Power Play option. The fortunate grand prize winner could opt for either annual installments over 29 years or a substantial one-time cash payment of $316.3 million before taxes, highlighting the immense stakes involved in the popular lottery game.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-1 defeat against the San Diego Padres, consequently falling out of first place in the National League West. This loss marked their second consecutive night of an anemic offense, managing only two hits. Despite the Dodgers having a strong pitching rotation available, starter Tyler Glasnow faltered in the fourth inning, while Padres' pitcher Nestor Cortes delivered an unexpectedly dominant performance, shutting down the Dodgers for six innings. What began as a two-game division lead for the Dodgers earlier in the week has now reversed, with the Padres taking a one-game advantage and on the verge of sweeping their rivals. The Dodgers' slumping lineup proved incapable of mounting a comeback against the Padres' formidable bullpen.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García's case has become a significant flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, as he now faces potential deportation to Uganda, a country he has no known connection to. This development follows his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, a country he fled due to gang violence, despite a US immigration judge granting him protection from such a return. Ábrego, who has no criminal record, was detained after a 2019 traffic stop. His lawyers are challenging the latest deportation attempt, arguing it is a vindictive act designed to punish him for contesting his initial erroneous removal. The saga underscores broader concerns about the administration's rapid deportation efforts and alleged violations of due process.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock experienced a significant drop, losing nearly $100 million in market value, shortly after the company unveiled a new, cleaner logo that removes its long-standing image of an overall-clad man. This rebrand is part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's broader effort to modernize the 55-year-old chain's image, including updating its down-home menu and store designs. Despite the company's assurance that its core values and "Uncle Herschel" remain, the redesign faced strong criticism from conservative commentators and marketing experts, with some decrying it as "woke" and a "fiasco." The negative market reaction underscores the challenges companies face in refreshing established brands without alienating their loyal customer base, particularly in a politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to expedite case resolutions and reduce the substantial number of migrants housed in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper detailed plans for a new, independent body staffed by adjudicators, designed to hear the 51,000 outstanding appeals more quickly than the current court system. This reform addresses "unacceptable delays" and mounting public pressure to end the use of hotels, which currently accommodate 32,000 asylum seekers. The initiative comes amidst rising frustration and protests across the UK regarding migrant housing, with the government committed to a "properly managed" closure of all asylum hotels within the current parliamentary term.</p>

While proponents assert their actions are driven by national pride and an effort to reclaim symbols from far-right groups, some residents express unease, perceiving the displays as a veiled expression of xenophobia or a catalyst for division. The proliferation of flags also coincides with heightened political tensions, including ongoing protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, underscoring a multifaceted public discourse on belonging and national sentiment.</p>

This decision, detailed by The Wall Street Journal, is part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin.

While Trump previously stated that allowing such strikes was a mistake, he recently acknowledged the difficulty of winning a war without offensive capabilities.

New York City secured the No. 4 spot, highly rated for its walkability, vibrant nightlife, diverse food scene, and rich culture, though its affordability was a concern for many Gen Z respondents. Melbourne, Australia, ranked No. 2, was praised as Australia's culture capital, with 96% of Gen Zers rating its art and culture highly and 91% describing its quality of life as "good" or "amazing."

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system, celebrating its 10th anniversary, continues to attract public engagement, with 57% of people having signed a petition in the past year. While some petitions have led to significant legislative changes, like "Finn's Law" for police service animals, many serious campaigns and numerous humorous ones rarely lead to direct government action. The system, designed to give the public a voice and allow backbench MPs to debate issues, is criticized by some for offering an "illusion of a feedback loop" rather than tangible change. Despite this, its chair defends it as a vital "bridge between the public and Parliament," demonstrating ongoing democratic engagement beyond elections.</p>

          <p>Young adults, some as young as 23, are increasingly opting for "preventative botox" to pre-empt the formation of wrinkles, a trend highlighted by Sydney Brown, who started injections at 23 with her plastic surgeon mother's guidance. This approach aims to reduce dynamic wrinkles and slow the aging process, with botox users in their 20s and early 30s now making up nearly a quarter of cosmetic clientele worldwide. While some practitioners support its long-term benefits, others, like Nora Nugent of BAAPS, advise against starting too early, calling it a waste of money and preferring to treat existing faint lines. Concerns are also raised about peer pressure, mental health impacts, and potential complications from unregulated practitioners, alongside the risk of building tolerance.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has announced he will swiftly sign a contentious GOP redistricting bill into law following its passage by the state Senate. The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw Texas's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to bolster the party's majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. This mid-decade redistricting effort was reportedly urged by President Trump. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the new map dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation. The bill's passage follows a weeks-long standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum, and has sparked a nationwide fight over political boundaries, with California launching a counter-redistricting plan.</p>

This exceptional declaration by the world's leading authority on food crises has significantly increased international pressure on Israel to halt its 22-month offensive, which began after Hamas' October 7, 2023, attacks. Israel has dismissed the famine determination as false, yet continues preparations to seize Gaza City, while ceasefire efforts remain on hold. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report indicates that nearly half a million people, approximately one-fourth of Gaza's population, face catastrophic hunger due intensified conflict, widespread displacement, and severe restrictions on humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with Deputy Director Christine Bordine stepping in as acting director. Congressional intelligence committee leaders were informed of the change but received no explanation. This removal follows a DIA assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities that reportedly contradicted President Trump's public statements about the damage, fueling concerns among DIA employees about the politicization of their work. This incident is part of a larger pattern, as two other high-ranking military officials, Rear Adm. Milton Sands and Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, were also removed from their positions without consultation from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the U.S. Special Operations Commanding General, indicating a significant shake-up within the defense intelligence community.</p>

This sets up a compelling Sunday showdown, with Cantlay aiming to deny Fleetwood his long-awaited American win, reminiscent of their Ryder Cup clash.

          <p>The United States immigrant population has declined by over a million people since President Donald Trump took office in January, reversing a 50-year growth trend. A Pew Research Center study reported a drop from 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June, with 750,000 immigrant workers leaving the labor force. This decline is attributed to Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, including mass deportations and border restrictions, as well as previous Biden administration asylum limitations. The report notes Mexico remains the largest origin country, though Mexican immigration has decreased since 2007. The analysis highlights a "supercharged" enforcement apparatus targeting all unauthorized immigrants.</p>

          <p>A male killer whale, Keijo, at the now-closed Marineland Antibes zoo, is reportedly undergoing sexual stimulation by trainers to prevent inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. This practice underscores the complex and unresolved issue of rehoming the orcas, as a French law banning whales in marine shows takes effect in December. Marineland managers explain the stimulation is crucial to manage Keijo's strong adolescent sexual urges and avoid potential injury from fighting. However, animal rights activists, including former SeaWorld trainers, criticize the method as unusual and a "perverse new low," raising concerns about Keijo's inbred status and the possibility of semen collection for breeding in other countries. The stalemate between the zoo, government, and activists means the orcas remain in limbo, with no European sanctuary yet established.</p>

This effort aims to understand the early inhabitants of the region, where state archaeologists claim an urban civilization existed as early as 580 BC, challenging existing narratives about Indian urbanization primarily in the north. The reconstructed faces show features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, suggesting global migration.

          <p>Russia's economy is reportedly "teetering on the brink of a recession" due to a disastrous grain harvest and a significant drop in its primary source of funds: oil and gas revenue. Unseasonable frost, record heat, and drought have severely damaged crops, with total grain production expected to fall 18% from its 2022 peak. Concurrently, oil and gas revenue plunged 27% in July year-over-year, leading to widening budget deficits. Russia has been forced to deplete its National Wealth Fund, which has shrunk from $135 billion in January 2022 to $35 billion by May. Experts suggest this fiscal crunch will encumber its war effort, though it may not compel President Putin to seek peace (not investment advice).</p>
