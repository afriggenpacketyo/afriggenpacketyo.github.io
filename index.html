          <p>This article presents a timeline of events surrounding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. Despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, the Trump administration claimed he was a member of MS-13, an allegation his family denies. The timeline details court battles, government missteps, and political maneuvering that followed, including a Supreme Court ruling and congressional involvement. Eventually, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. to face charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the concept of federal rental aid with time limits, focusing on the Delaware State Housing Authority's program as an example. The program includes a work requirement, regular financial check-ins, and a savings component where monthly payments stay flat, allowing participants to save money over time. While the Department of Housing and Urban Development is considering expanding time limits and work requirements nationally, housing policy experts express concerns about their effectiveness and potential consequences for renters. The article highlights both the successes and challenges of implementing time limits in rental assistance programs, referencing experiences in Washington state and Delaware. </p>

          <p>Former Yankees star Alex Rodriguez discusses the pressure on Aaron Judge to perform well in the postseason to solidify his legacy as a true Yankees legend. Rodriguez, drawing from his own experiences of struggling in the playoffs before winning the 2009 World Series, believes Judge needs a defining October moment. While Judge's regular-season numbers are impressive, his postseason performance has been lacking, and Rodriguez suggests that overcoming this hurdle will cement his place in Yankees history. Rodriguez also touches on the Yankees' recent struggles against the Los Angeles Dodgers and the absence of Gerrit Cole from the pitching rotation.</p>

          <p>China's Gen Z is reshaping the country's liquor industry, with a growing preference for low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages over traditional baijiu. Farmers in Baisha, known for baijiu production, are shifting from sorghum to green plums to cater to this trend. Industry insiders say that younger consumers are prioritizing self-indulgent experiences over social rituals, leading to a shift in alcohol consumption patterns. More Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to this younger demographic, focusing on lighter and fruitier options.</p>

Despite previous efforts by the FBI to dismantle the group, it appears to be growing and actively seeking new members. The group's online presence shows solicitation of crypto donations to support the training event, which they claim is aimed at creating a "White Defense Force." Experts express concern that the group is willing to take the risk of advertising its activities publicly, suggesting they believe momentum is on their side. </p>

          <p>The article explores the impact of increased immigration enforcement on immigrant communities in New York City, particularly focusing on the use of electronic monitoring. Asylum seekers are often required to wear ankle monitors or use mobile apps for surveillance, leading to feelings of paranoia and stigma. This constant surveillance affects their ability to work, maintain relationships, and live normal lives, and the fear extends to entire neighborhoods, impacting local businesses and community activities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times editorial board argues that Donald Trump is presiding over a culture of corruption, where he and his family benefit financially from people seeking favorable treatment from the government. The editorial cites the cryptocurrency industry as a prime example, where Trump and his relatives profit from the sale of their cryptocurrency, and government policy changes benefit those who have helped the Trumps profit. The board contrasts this with traditional corruption, noting a lack of direct bribes but an environment where enriching the Trumps leads to policy changes that benefit those contributors. This culture weakens American democracy and undermines faith in government and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential costs of leaving a 401(k) with a former employer, including maintenance fees that can erode retirement savings over time. While rolling funds into an IRA is an option, it can also come with higher investment fees, potentially costing workers thousands of dollars. The Department of Labor has created a retirement savings lost and found database to help workers locate old retirement plans, and updating contact information with former employers can also help. Experts advise workers to carefully weigh their options and consider the potential costs and benefits of each choice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's planned military parade in Washington, D.C., could be a patriotic celebration and an opportunity to counter misperceptions about the armed forces. While acknowledging concerns that Trump may use the parade to intimidate critics, the author suggests it could also bring Americans closer to service members and boost military recruitment. With the military facing recruitment challenges, a celebratory parade could familiarize civilians with their armed forces and draw talented young Americans to serve. The author emphasizes the importance of looking past the president's potential solipsism and embracing the men and women who defend the United States.</p>

          <p>The article discusses President Trump's order to investigate Joe Biden's cognitive decline and its implications for presidential immunity. The author argues that the investigation, while seemingly absurd, could lead to a further expansion of presidential immunity, potentially protecting not only the president but also his aides. This expansion could remove the last structural restraint on Trump's team and enable more lawlessness. The author suggests that Biden's aides should defend themselves against the investigation on its merits, rather than relying on procedural immunity grounds, to avoid setting a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on Ncuti Gatwa's brief but impactful tenure as the Fifteenth Doctor on the British series Doctor Who, highlighting his significance as the first Black, openly queer, and African-born actor to play the role. Gatwa's Doctor brought a refreshing queerness to the franchise, embracing a more emotionally available and fashion-forward persona. The author argues that Gatwa's casting allowed the series to explore the ramifications of the Doctor's ability to look like anybody, confronting racism and privilege in ways previous Doctors had not. Despite a somewhat rushed ending, Gatwa's contribution to Doctor Who is celebrated for expanding the series' notion of limitless possibility.</p>

          <p>The NHS app in England will become the primary communication method for millions more patients, saving the health service Â£200m over three years. This Â£50m investment will enable more test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders to be sent directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters, and the changes are expected to free up NHS phone lines. This move aims to modernize patient care and improve access to healthcare management, with over 11 million people logging into the app monthly.</p>
