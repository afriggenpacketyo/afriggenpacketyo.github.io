          <p>A recent report indicates Pakistan is lagging in governmental AI readiness compared to its regional neighbors, with critics pointing to an underdeveloped national AI policy. This regulatory vacuum has fueled a surge in low-quality, AI-generated 'slop' content on social media, raising concerns about misinformation and propaganda. While some entrepreneurs are finding economic opportunities using AI tools, experts emphasize the need for greater investment in AI education and ethical guidelines. The country faces a challenge in balancing the creative potential of AI with the urgent need for a robust national strategy and regulation to prevent its misuse.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have significantly intensified their cross-border drone strikes, with both sides reporting hundreds of drones being launched and intercepted daily. The escalation has caused civilian casualties and disruptions, including in Moscow and Kyiv, where a metro station entrance was damaged. Amidst the heightened conflict, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for renewed ceasefire negotiations, a sentiment echoed by the Kremlin, which acknowledged President Trump's efforts to mediate. Both nations are also publicly committing to expanding their drone production and strike capabilities, creating a complex backdrop for any potential peace discussions.</p>

          <p>Eric Flores, an Army veteran and former federal prosecutor, has launched his Republican campaign for Texas' 34th Congressional District, a key battleground the GOP aims to flip in 2026. The district, which includes Brownsville and parts of McAllen, has been trending Republican, with President Trump winning it by nearly five points after President Biden had carried it by fifteen. Flores is positioning himself as a fighter aligned with President Trump, aiming to unseat incumbent Democrat Vicente Gonzalez. Gonzalez won his last election by a narrow 2.5-point margin, making the district a prime target for the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p>

          <p>State-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record by discovering a significant uranium deposit at an unprecedented depth. This achievement highlights China's advancing capabilities in deep-earth resource exploration technology. The deposit is of a type that is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine, which is crucial for a nation heavily reliant on uranium imports for its nuclear power and weapons programs. Last year, China produced 1,700 tonnes of uranium while importing 13,000 tonnes, underscoring the strategic importance of this domestic discovery for its energy and defense sectors.</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Backed by major crypto investors like Pantera Capital, it plans to replicate MicroStrategy's bitcoin accumulation strategy but for Ethereum's native currency. The company will differentiate itself by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the network's security, rather than simply holding the asset. This move comes as ether gains prominence, partly due to new regulatory clarity and institutional interest in tokenization on the Ethereum network. (not investment advice)</p>

Amid the tragedy, Israel issued new evacuation orders for parts of central Gaza, a key area for aid distribution, further complicating humanitarian efforts.

Speaking on CNBC, Bessent suggested the review should go beyond recent controversies over building renovations to assess whether the Fed has been successful in its core mission. His comments follow a period of conflict, including reports of President Trump considering firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell and criticizing the central bank's interest rate policy. Bessent argued that with inflation moderating, the Fed should consider easing rates, questioning the mindset of the institution's economists.</p>

The article notes that many parents unwittingly discourage their children's natural desire to help by prioritizing efficiency or micromanaging, causing kids to lose enthusiasm.

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance.

The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones, a phenomenon present since late 2022.

          <p>This article provides a snapshot of current mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates for consumers navigating a challenging housing market. As of mid-July 2025, the average 30-year mortgage rate is around 6.75%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.95%. The report suggests that while rates are higher than in previous years, there may be relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aim for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and shop around to compare offers from different lenders for both new purchases and refinancing.

          <p>A 20-year-old unlicensed driver, Cain Byrne, has been sentenced to over 11 years in jail for killing an 81-year-old pedestrian in a hit-and-run crash. Byrne was seen on CCTV inhaling nitrous oxide from a balloon moments before he ran a red light at over 50mph, striking Graham Slinn, who died at the scene. Byrne, who has 27 previous convictions, then sped away from the crash site. The judge described him as having an "utter disregard for the law" and a "hardened determination to commit repeated dangerous crime." Mr. Slinn's family expressed their profound grief over the loss of their beloved father and husband.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed a controversial policy shift that would condition development aid for African and other nations on their cooperation with migration enforcement, including deportations and border control. This move, which could lead to aid cuts for non-compliant countries, has been condemned by humanitarian organizations and African policy experts as coercive and neocolonial. Critics argue the policy distorts development goals, turns African nations into border guards, and ignores the root causes of migration, such as poverty and instability, some of which are exacerbated by European trade and foreign policies. This approach risks undermining trust and long-term partnerships.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Taiwanese companies are already reacting to the threat of potential U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump, with at least a quarter suspending expansion plans and 5% beginning to cut staff. The report, from two opposition-aligned think tanks, surveyed 238 firms and found that over half with U.S. trade ties expect to be negatively affected. While a hypothetical 10% tariff was seen by many as having a minor impact, the preemptive actions by businesses indicate significant anxiety within Taiwan's economy. The situation highlights the real-world consequences of tariff threats on business confidence and investment decisions.</p>

          <p>A landscaper in North Carolina was arrested after allegedly breaking into a client's $4.3 million mansion to host a large graduation party for his son while the homeowners were away. Police responded to noise complaints and found 300-400 people at the home, with evidence of underage drinking. The landscaper, Michael Brown, was charged with breaking and entering and other offenses after first claiming to be the homeowner's grandson. The homeowners' son stated that Brown took advantage of his parents' trust and has definitively lost them as a client, highlighting the risks of granting service providers access to one's home.</p>

          <p>A new study has quantified the immense success of global emergency vaccine stockpiles, concluding they have reduced cases and deaths from outbreaks by 60%. These stockpiles for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis have averted an estimated 6 million cases and 300,000 deaths over two decades, yielding over $32 billion in economic benefits. The research highlights the critical importance of having vaccines ready for rapid deployment to contain outbreaks before they escalate. The findings come at a crucial time, as a significant drop in global health funding forces organizations like Gavi to make difficult decisions about future priorities.</p>
