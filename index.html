        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A strike by unionized locomotive engineers has shut down New Jersey Transit's rail network, impacting tens of thousands of commuters in the New York metropolitan area. The strike, the first statewide transit strike in New Jersey since 1983, stems from a dispute over pay, with the union demanding wages on par with other regional railroads. NJ Transit's bus system continues to operate, and the agency is providing chartered buses, but these can only accommodate a fraction of the displaced train riders. The shutdown is expected to cause significant disruption, costing the New York City economy an estimated $6 million per hour in lost productivity, with transportation experts warning of ripple effects across other transit systems and increased road congestion. The article highlights the impact on commuters, the agency's contingency plans, and the economic consequences of the strike.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was characterized by opulent displays and historic economic agreements. The Gulf states committed to significant investments in the U.S., including a $1.2 trillion economic exchange with Qatar and a $600 billion investment pledge from Saudi Arabia. While some question the feasibility of these figures, the visit underscored the Gulf states' desire to strengthen ties with the U.S. for business, military, and technological partnerships. The article suggests that the Gulf countries are competing with other regions, such as Europe, for closer relations with the U.S. administration, and that these economic deals are vital to increase the attractiveness of the Middle East visit.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, China is intensifying its efforts to strengthen its domestic market and reduce its reliance on overseas trade. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of bolstering "domestic circulation" to enhance the country's economic self-reliance. This strategy aims to leverage the economy's internal stability and long-term growth potential to mitigate the impact of global uncertainties.

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division. Despite ongoing global uncertainties, revenues rose 7% year-on-year, with double-digit growth in brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The company's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require agility and discipline, with headwinds such as gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations posing challenges.</p>

          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's decision to manufacture most of its products in China has created an existential vulnerability for the world. The book claims that China wouldn't be what it is today without Apple, as the company has trained millions of workers and transferred significant technology and know-how to the country. McGee highlights the shift from Apple's early days as a renegade upstart to its current reliance on Chinese manufacturing. The book suggests that this close relationship has troubling consequences for the entire world, potentially enabling China to outpace American innovation.</p>

The GDP shrank by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter and 0.7% year-on-year. Despite this, domestic demand showed some strength. The article also notes the Bank of Japan's warning that U.S. tariff policy will exert downward pressure on economic activity and prices in Japan.</p>

          <p>A large, dark patch has appeared off the coast of Rio de Janeiro near Barra da Tijuca Beach. Reuters drone shots reveal the brownish water contrasting with the ocean's blue. A biologist attributes the stain to urban growth and inadequate sanitation, leading to sewage flowing into the rivers, lagoon, and ultimately, the sea. The article notes the presence of cyanobacteria, a type of algae that thrives in unhealthy conditions with high sewage content.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, is under investigation for an Instagram post that officials claim amounted to a call for President Trump’s assassination.

          <p>This guest essay discusses the rise of the far-right in Romania, with George Simion likely to become the country’s next president. The author argues that this rise is rooted in decades of economic failure, leading to anti-establishment anger. Despite respectable growth numbers, Romania performs poorly on social indicators, with a large portion of the population at risk of poverty. The author criticizes mainstream parties for failing to address these issues, suggesting that both candidates in the runoff election share an allegiance to the business class and offer no fundamental change to the country's economic framework.</p>
