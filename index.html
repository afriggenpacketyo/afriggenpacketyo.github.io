          <p>Columbia University has requested the New York City Police Department's assistance in removing pro-Palestinian demonstrators from the campus library after they occupied the building and vandalized property. According to Acting University President Claire Shipman, the decision to involve the NYPD was necessary to ensure the safety of the community due to the large number of participants and the presence of individuals not affiliated with the university. Two public safety officers were injured during a crowd surge as protesters attempted to force their way into the building. Mayor Eric Adams emphasized that New York City supports peaceful protest but will not tolerate lawlessness, offering support to Jewish students who feel threatened and urging non-Columbia affiliates to leave the campus immediately.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion article argues that the charitable tax deduction in the United States distorts American philanthropy by disproportionately benefiting wealthy donors and the institutions they support. The author suggests that the current system incentivizes charities to cater to the preferences of the rich, leading to an uneven distribution of federal subsidies. The article proposes alternative approaches, such as matching private donations or emulating Canada's tax credit system, to create a more equitable tax incentive for charitable giving that is not determined by the donor's income. The author calls for a change in the law to ensure every donated dollar receives the same federal subsidy, regardless of the donor's income bracket.</p>

          <p>A US judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing a violation of their due process rights. The order restricts the administration's ability to quickly deport migrants without providing written notice and a chance to appeal. Libya's prime minister has stated the country refuses to be a destination for migrant deportations. The US State Department advises against travel to Libya due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest.</p>
