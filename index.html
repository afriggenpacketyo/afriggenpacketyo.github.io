          <p>The remains of two Scottish soldiers, missing for over 100 years since the Battle of Loos in World War I, have been identified through a meticulous investigation. Construction workers in France discovered the remains in 2021, leading a specialist UK Ministry of Defence unit, nicknamed the "war detectives," to use historical records, personal artifacts like tramway buttons, and DNA testing to confirm their identities. Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan were recently buried with full military honors, bringing long-awaited closure to their families.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is demanding action from the UK's Department for Education over what it calls a "failing" Teachers' Pension Scheme. The union reports significant issues, including severe payment delays that have left recent retirees in financial difficulty, excessive phone wait times, and poor communication. The problems, affecting a scheme with two million members, are believed to stem partly from a 2018 legal judgment that required complex recalculations, but the union also suspects a lack of capacity is compounding the delays.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, these pilots were among the first to witness the scale of the devastation, conducting rescue missions and delivering essential supplies. Coordinated by groups like the United Cajun Navy, they performed hundreds of missions, airlifting stranded residents and providing a vital lifeline of food and medicine to isolated communities before larger-scale relief could arrive.</p>

          <p>The cost of policing ongoing protests in Epping, UK, is projected to reach £1.7 million by October, following demonstrations related to an asylum seeker housed at The Bell Hotel. Tensions arose after Hadush Kebatu, who was staying at the hotel, was charged and later jailed for sexual assault, leading to numerous protests and 32 arrests for disorder. The police, fire and crime commissioner for Essex stated the force must absorb the substantial costs, as government assistance is only available if the bill exceeds £4 million, highlighting a significant financial strain.</p>

          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, which fell to a record low of 0.721 in 2023 before a slight recent rise, threatens to undermine decades of economic progress. Economic studies warn that the shrinking workforce could lead to near-zero growth by the 2040s and potentially an economic contraction, despite over $270 billion spent on pro-childbirth incentives. This demographic cliff also strains the national pension system and reduces the pool of available military personnel, posing significant long-term challenges for Asia's fourth-largest economy.

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases a stark contrast in resources, pitting the world's best-funded team against a squad that relies on fundraising.

In contrast, Canada's players earn a fraction of that and their World Cup preparations were partly funded by donations, yet they have reached the final through creative coaching and by having many players compete in England's professional league.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell has shared her vision for the highly anticipated new film adaptation of "Wuthering Heights," stating she wants to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced when first reading the novel as a teenager. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the film's provocative trailer has already generated significant buzz. Speaking at a festival in author Emily Brontë's hometown, Fennell described the book as singular, sexy, and devastating, and explained that her adaptation is an emotional response meant to fulfill her "14-year-old wish" of what the story felt like.</p>

          <p>The former acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California, Michele Beckwith, has stated she was fired after she insisted that Border Patrol agents follow a court order during planned immigration raids. Beckwith says she informed the sector chief that a federal injunction prohibited his agents from making arrests without probable cause in her district. Shortly after sending an email emphasizing the need to comply with the Constitution, the career prosecutor's access was revoked and her employment was terminated, raising concerns about political interference.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old Fremont, California man has been charged with murder for allegedly carrying out a planned, vigilante-style killing of a 71-year-old registered sex offender. Police say the suspect, Varun Suresh, admitted to using the state's Megan's Law website to research and deliberately target the victim, David Brimmer, due to his criminal record. Suresh allegedly posed as a door-to-door CPA to lure the victim out before stabbing him to death, telling investigators the act was "honestly really fun" and that he had waited years to kill a sex offender.</p>
