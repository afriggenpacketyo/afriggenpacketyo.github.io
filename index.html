          <p>The 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage is set to begin, with a notable opening pairing reuniting Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood for Team Europe. This article explores the critical factors that will likely decide the tournament, including the importance of a strong start in the first-day foursomes, a session that has historically set the tone for the eventual winner. It also discusses the potential impact of the famously boisterous New York crowd and how each team's experience, or lack thereof, could play a pivotal role. The strategic decisions by captains Luke Donald and Keegan Bradley are highlighted as essential elements in the quest to win the coveted trophy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>America First Legal (AFL), a group founded by former Trump aide Stephen Miller, claims that California lacks the legal standing to sue the Trump administration over its executive order on transgender athletes in school sports. AFL asserts that public records requests to state agencies, including the California Interscholastic Federation, yielded no documents proving harm or harassment against transgender athletes, which undermines the state's lawsuit. The state's Attorney General, Robert Bonta, sued to block the federal order, claiming it causes "severe harm." This legal battle is part of a broader conflict between the Trump administration and California over transgender rights and Title IX interpretations.</p>

          <p>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced a significant corporate overhaul that includes closing an unspecified number of underperforming coffee shops and eliminating 900 non-retail positions. The restructuring, part of the "Back to Starbucks" revitalization plan, is projected to cost the company $1 billion, with major expenses related to breaking leases and employee severance. This move comes as the coffee giant faces slowing sales and increased competition, aiming to improve financial performance and enhance the in-store customer experience. The company's total store count in North America is expected to decrease by about 1% in the upcoming fiscal year as a result of these changes.</p>

          <p>Newly obtained architectural renderings provide a more detailed view of the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently being built in the White House's East Wing. The project, announced by the Trump administration, will have a seated capacity of 650 and is significantly larger than the main White House building. According to press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the construction is being funded by private donors and President Trump himself, with a commitment to disclose donor names. Corporate and individual donors, including Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir, have reportedly pledged nearly $200 million to cover the costs of the project, which is being designed by McCrery Architects PLLC.</p>

          <h2>Average HELOC Interest Rates Dip Below 8% Following Federal Reserve Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 16:03:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.88%, making it an increasingly attractive borrowing option for homeowners. With cumulative home equity in the U.S. reaching a record $17.8 trillion, many owners have substantial funds to tap into.

Furthermore, with expectations of additional Fed rate cuts, the variable rate of a HELOC could lead to even lower costs for borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cuts Funding for Animal Testing, Fueling Debate on Medical Research</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, accelerating a move by federal health agencies to phase out research on live animals. This shift is driven by a coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress who question the necessity and cost of such experiments. While proponents celebrate the move as a watershed moment for animal rights, it has sparked a fierce debate with patients and researchers who argue that animal testing is crucial for developing life-saving treatments, such as those for COVID-19 and rare genetic disorders. The FDA is now promoting alternatives like AI modeling, but experts caution that the science is not yet ready to fully replace animal models.</p>

The FTC accused Amazon of using manipulative design practices, or "subscription traps," that violated consumer protection laws.

These costs are lower than they were earlier in the year and significantly less than last fall.

However, opposition politicians warned against over-optimism, with some interpreting Trump's words as a desire for the U.S. to distance itself from the conflict by shifting responsibility to Europe. Analysts believe the change could be a result of sustained diplomatic efforts by Ukraine and its allies, as well as Russia's uncompromising stance.</p>

          <p>The National Personnel Records Center, a branch of the National Archives, improperly released a largely unredacted version of Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military file to a political opponent, a potential violation of federal privacy laws. The documents, which included her Social Security number and home addresses, were requested by an ally of her opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The Archives admitted a technician failed to follow standard procedures and has apologized to Sherrill's office. The incident has drawn sharp criticism, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries calling for a criminal investigation into what he termed the illegal weaponization of a veteran's records for political gain.</p>

          <p>Democratic congressional leaders have dismissed a White House memo threatening widespread layoffs of federal workers during a potential government shutdown as an "intimidation" tactic. The Office of Management and Budget instructed federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force notices for employees in discretionary programs, in addition to standard furloughs. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated they would not be swayed by the move, maintaining their position in the funding stalemate. With the October 1 deadline looming, Democrats are continuing to push for negotiations on health care priorities in exchange for their support to keep the government open.</p>

          <p>A RIPTA bus carrying passengers crashed and rolled onto its side on the Claiborne Pell Bridge in Rhode Island, resulting in injuries to the driver and two passengers. According to the Rhode Island State Police, the driver appeared to lose control of the vehicle, striking a guardrail on the left before crossing lanes to hit a light pole and another guardrail on the right, causing it to overturn. The accident, which occurred on the Jamestown side of the bridge, led to the closure of a westbound lane for several hours. While the investigation is ongoing, heavy rains and a flash flood warning were active in the area at the time of the crash.</p>

          <p>With interest rates declining after another Federal Reserve cut, the monthly cost of a $75,000 home equity loan has become more affordable for homeowners. A 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.34% now costs approximately $923 per month, while a 15-year term at 8.21% costs about $726 per month. These payments are lower than they were at the beginning of 2025 and also less expensive than last fall. The article emphasizes that because home equity loans have a fixed interest rate, homeowners can lock in these lower costs for the duration of the loan, providing financial predictability.

          <p>During a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House, President Donald Trump urged Turkey to cease its purchases of Russian oil, framing it as a critical step to cut off Moscow's funding amid the war in Ukraine. The discussion occurred as Erdogan seeks to overcome U.S. sanctions and a ban on purchasing advanced F-35 fighter jets, which was imposed after Turkey acquired a Russian air defense system. Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached on the F-35s and that sanctions could be lifted soon, but he emphasized that stopping Russian energy imports would be "the best thing" Turkey could do.</p>

The practice, known for its unique 'shape-note' notation, has seen a resurgence among younger people and now includes more diverse voices, including its first Latino and Black composers.

Researchers at the University of Barcelona found she possessed unique genetic variants that protected against many common diseases, which she inherited from her parents. This genetic advantage was complemented by a lifestyle that included no smoking or alcohol and a diet rich in fish, olive oil, and yogurt. The study highlights that her good health, free from cancer or dementia, indicates that advanced age is not intrinsically linked to poor health.</p>

According to meteorologists, the outcome depends on the relative strength of the two systems; often, the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one.
