          <p>A driver plowed a car into a crowd celebrating Liverpool's Premier League victory, injuring nearly 50 people, including children. The incident occurred at the end of a festive day where hundreds of thousands gathered for a parade through Liverpool city center. Police have arrested a 53-year-old British man and are treating the crash as an isolated incident, not related to terrorism, and are not seeking additional suspects. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed his shock and gratitude to the emergency services, while Liverpool F.C. conveyed their support for those affected by the incident.</p>

          <p>Authorities are searching for Grant Hardin, a former police chief imprisoned for murder and sexual assault, after he escaped from a high-security prison in Arkansas. Hardin, 56, was serving a decades-long sentence and is considered extremely dangerous. He escaped wearing a makeshift law enforcement uniform, making the search more difficult, especially given the heavy rain at the time of the escape. Law enforcement officials are warning residents not to approach him and are checking vehicles in the surrounding counties, fearing he may take someone hostage to acquire transportation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a significant tax write-off for professional sports team owners, a move that could impact the current frenzy of wealthy individuals buying teams. The legislation would limit the deduction of team's intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, over 15 years to only half their value. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and potentially affect current owners' investments, with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimating the change would raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years. Team owners are lobbying against the provision, while the White House claims it's about fairness for fans.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring retailers like Walmart to absorb the costs of tariffs on goods from China, rather than raise prices for consumers. This demand contradicts basic business principles, as retailers would be forced to sell goods at a loss. While some retailers may attempt to comply for political reasons, the reality is that tariffs are a tax on imported goods, ultimately paid by consumers, and pretending otherwise is a self-defeating strategy for businesses. The article suggests that businesses should be transparent about tariff-related price increases rather than engaging in misleading wordplay.</p>

          <p>Small-scale distillers in Japan are fueling a domestic gin boom by using homegrown ingredients and innovative techniques, such as redistilling Okinawan spirits and adding local specialties. These distillers are incorporating local flavors like bitter gourd, burnt lacquer wood, and camellia flowers into their gins. The trend is supported by the convertibility of existing whiskey and shochu equipment for gin production, alongside the rise of dedicated e-commerce sites and bars. Major manufacturers are also entering the market, suggesting the boom is likely to continue.</p>

          <p>As rocket launches become more frequent, scientists are studying the sonic booms generated by returning boosters, particularly those from SpaceX. The Falcon 9 booster creates a unique three-part sonic boom, described as 'boom buh-boom', due to its design and descent. Researchers are working to understand how these sounds propagate and how to mitigate disruptions to communities near launch sites. This research is increasingly important as SpaceX tests Starship, a much larger rocket expected to generate significantly louder sonic booms.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite its net external assets reaching a record high. This shift is attributed to a weaker yen, which increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, and Germany's large current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets rose significantly, driven by direct investment in the U.S., while its external liabilities also increased, influenced by the yen's depreciation.

          <p>The government in England is implementing changes to apprenticeship funding, prioritizing training opportunities for individuals under 21. Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will now be restricted to those under 21, shifting the financial burden to employers for older apprentices. This move aims to increase entry-level apprenticeships for younger adults, with the government promising to create 120,000 more training opportunities. The decision has sparked controversy, with critics arguing it will negatively impact public services and limit professional opportunities for those who don't attend university.</p>
