          <p>Joseph Neumayer, a 28-year-old holding both U.S. and German citizenship, was apprehended at JFK Airport after being deported from Israel, accused of attempting to firebomb the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. The incident occurred earlier this month, with Neumayer allegedly spitting at an embassy guard and leaving a backpack containing three Molotov cocktails. Social media posts attributed to Neumayer contained threats against the U.S., Americans, and President Trump, leading to charges of attempting to destroy the embassy, which carries a potential 20-year prison sentence; authorities have condemned the alleged actions as violent and intolerable.</p>

          <p>A New York Times opinion piece argues that the Supreme Court is enabling President Trump to consolidate power within the executive branch. The author, Kate Shaw, a law professor, contends that the court's recent decisions, including one involving the removal of officials from the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, effectively overrule established precedent without proper deliberation. Shaw suggests that the court's actions risk undermining the rule of law and emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional boundaries, potentially leading to a dangerous concentration of authority in the presidency.</p>

          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" is gaining traction as a more effective approach than traditional methods. This framework emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, focusing on creating a safe environment for children to express their emotions openly. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's feelings without judgment, view misbehavior as a signal for support, and set boundaries with empathy rather than control. The approach involves parents doing their own inner work to become less reactive and modeling healthy conflict resolution by apologizing and reconnecting after difficult moments.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American tennis player, secured a victory in his first-round match at the French Open, but the win was overshadowed by his recent experience with a repossessed truck. Paul explained that he missed three payments on his Ford F-150 after changing banks, leading to the vehicle's repossession, an incident he found humorous despite his $10.8 million career earnings. After discovering the truck was missing through his trainer, Paul was able to recover it, sharing the experience on social media with a video set to Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On."</p>

          <p>Fiscal conservatives within the Republican party are threatening to block President Trump's spending bill in the Senate if it fails to address the growing national debt. Senator Ron Johnson stated that he believes there is enough opposition to stall the bill until Trump gets serious about spending reduction, highlighting concerns that the bill could add trillions to the federal deficit. The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts in exchange for benefit cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps, but faces challenges in the Senate due to Republican concerns about the deficit and the impact of Medicaid cuts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his attacks on Harvard University, criticizing the school's international students and alleging that their home countries are unfriendly to the U.S. following a judge's decision to block his administration's attempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Trump stated that he wants to know the identities of these foreign students, claiming that Harvard is not forthcoming with this information, but the university has not yet responded to the allegations. The legal battle comes after the administration froze over $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to Harvard, accusing the school of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
