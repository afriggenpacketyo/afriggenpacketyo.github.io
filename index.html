          <p>Investor Warren Buffett voiced his disapproval of President Trump's use of tariffs as a trade weapon, cautioning that it could alienate other nations. Speaking at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, Buffett emphasized the importance of balanced trade but questioned Trump's approach. He highlighted that global safety is enhanced when more countries prosper through trade and cooperation. Buffett also addressed Berkshire's large cash reserves, indicating a lack of attractively priced investments currently, while remaining optimistic about future opportunities.

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal includes eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), along with the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

          <p>A recent study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry highlights lifestyle choices that can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia, stroke, and depression. The study indicates that modifiable risk factors account for a substantial portion of these conditions, including 60% of strokes, 40% of dementia cases, and 35% of late-life depression. Experts emphasize the interconnectedness of these conditions, as individuals who have experienced a stroke are more prone to developing depression or dementia, and vice versa. Dr. Sanjula Singh, the lead author, recommends focusing on these lifestyle adjustments for optimal brain health.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that grocery and gas prices are decreasing, but economists challenge this claim, citing government data indicating otherwise. While overall inflation has eased slightly during Trump's tenure, price hikes for food have accelerated, and gas prices have remained relatively stable. Experts note that even with lower inflation, prices are still increasing, just at a slower rate. The rise in egg prices due to bird flu further contradicts Trump's claims of falling grocery costs.</p>

          <p>Child and family therapists have identified the six most common worries among children that parents often don't realize, including social dynamics, social media, big life changes, packed schedules, inconsistency, and trauma. Children are increasingly concerned about fitting in, navigating social media pressures, and managing the stress of busy routines. Trauma, even from seemingly minor incidents, can significantly impact a child's sense of safety. The therapists emphasize the importance of teaching children coping strategies during calm moments, such as naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, and using affirming phrases, to help them manage intense feelings.</p>

Albanese criticized the opposition for adopting "American-style politics" of division, while also highlighting his government's success in improving relations with China.

The campaign was dominated by cost-of-living concerns, with Albanese promising to make healthcare and housing more affordable, as well as address climate change and advance reconciliation with First Nations people.

          <p>Voice of America (VoA) is set to resume broadcasting after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked an executive order by President Trump to dismantle the broadcaster.

While VoA staff can return to the office and resume programming, the court ruling upheld the funding freeze for other publicly funded broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks.</p>

          <p>Two major US scientific societies, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), are collaborating to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis's impact. This initiative follows the Trump administration's dismissal of contributors to the sixth National Climate Assessment (NCA), the US government's key study on climate change preparedness. The AMS and AGU aim to sustain the momentum of the NCA by creating a mechanism for continued research on climate change's effects. The collaboration seeks to provide the science needed to support global efforts in addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to El Salvador and paying for their imprisonment without conviction raises concerns about potential violations of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. El Salvador's prison system is known for its harsh conditions, including torture and ill-treatment. Legal experts suggest that focusing on due-process claims may be a safer legal strategy, as deportation alone is not considered punishment under Eighth Amendment standards. The administration's actions are viewed as an attempt to circumvent the Bill of Rights by imprisoning individuals without trials or sentences.</p>

          <p>China is considering offering to deepen cooperation with the United States in combating the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals as a way to de-escalate trade tensions. This offer could include sending China's top security official, Wang Xiaohong, to Washington to initiate trade talks. China hopes that a pledge to address the fentanyl issue will lead to a simultaneous reduction of tariffs by both governments. Cooperation on fentanyl had been frozen in 2022 but resumed after a summit between President Xi Jinping and President Biden in 2023.</p>

He emphasized that "trade should not be a weapon" and defended the broader concept of global trade flows, stating that countries should specialize in what they do best. Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, and the company warned that Trump's trade policies were generating "considerable uncertainty" that could affect its operating results. Despite the concerns, Berkshire's cash hoard continued to grow to a record $347.7 billion.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a man who injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the development of a novel antivenom. Immunologist Jacob Glanville collaborated with Friede to analyze his blood, which contained antibodies effective against several snake neurotoxins. The resulting antivenom, tested in mice, can protect against bites from 19 species of venomous snakes. The research highlights the potential for human-derived antibodies and small-molecule drugs to revolutionize snakebite treatment, offering a more effective and safer alternative to traditional methods.</p>

          <p>Peter Dutton's defeat in the Australian election is attributed to a combination of factors, including the "Trump effect" and inconsistent policies. Dutton, the opposition leader, struggled to shake off comparisons to Donald Trump, particularly due to his hard-line conservatism and support for controversial immigration policies. His campaign was marred by gaffes and policy missteps, which contributed to a sense of confusion among voters. The electorate appeared to reject Dutton's Trump-esque rhetoric in favor of Albanese's more stable and consistent approach.</p>
