        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Representative Elise Stefanik, a prominent Republican ally of Donald Trump, has sharply criticized Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, labeling her the "worst governor in America." The public dispute ignited after Hochul accused Stefanik of supporting Medicaid cuts that would endanger hospitals in her district. Stefanik retorted by condemning Hochul's policies, particularly the allocation of Medicaid benefits to undocumented immigrants and what she describes as widespread waste and fraud within the state's program. This exchange intensifies speculation about Stefanik's potential 2026 gubernatorial campaign.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Democratic and Republican administrations. In a 6-3 decision related to a challenge against President Trump's birthright citizenship order, the court ruled that such sweeping orders generally exceed the authority granted to federal courts. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, argued that courts should not overstep their power when checking the executive branch. The ruling allows the Trump administration to proceed with developing its policy while narrower legal challenges continue.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican-led budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause up to 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would be devastating for the state, potentially forcing rural hospital closures and increasing premiums on the state's insurance marketplace. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the changes would cut Medicaid spending significantly while leaving millions more uninsured nationwide. Newsom stated the cuts are reckless and cruel, undermining the state's progress in healthcare coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates a link between consuming a traditional Japanese diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed diets including rice, miso soup, soy products, fish, and vegetables, finding that participants who followed this pattern were less likely to report symptoms of depression. Researchers suggest that specific nutrients, such as those found in seaweed, soy, and omega-3-rich fish, may contribute to improved mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation. Further research is needed to confirm these findings for public health applications.</p>

Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence, leaving only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large from the high-profile jailbreak. The escape, which involved exploiting a faulty cell door, has drawn criticism towards the management of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's office.

          <p>A former assistant pastor in Oxnard, California, has been sentenced to two years in prison for stealing $200,000 from his church. Curtis Frank Lemons, 68, admitted to issuing a fraudulent cashier's check to himself in December 2020 while the church's founder, Rev. Jesse James Taylor, was in his final months of life. Lemons used the stolen funds, a significant portion of which came from the reverend's personal contributions, on personal expenses including a new home in Tennessee, a car, and dental work. He pleaded guilty to grand theft and money laundering after an investigation revealed his misuse of the church's money.</p>

The measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, failed in a 53-47 vote that was largely along party lines. The resolution would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before taking further military action, following recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Kaine argued that the Constitution grants Congress the sole power to declare war, a principle he stressed was vital to prevent unilateral decisions on military engagement.</p>

The show, which follows two sisters and their mother, explores taboo subjects like mental health and abortion with a bleakly humorous perspective. Sadler, the writer, explains that the new series will be even more intense, influenced by the "bleak" modern dating scene and a desire to satirize the social pressures on young women. The sisters draw from their own experiences growing up in an all-woman household, aiming to create comedy from a distinctly female viewpoint.</p>

These initial images have already revealed previously hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation, offering scientists an unprecedented tool to understand these vital ecosystems. The ultimate goal is to create a global 3D map of forests to more accurately estimate their role in mitigating climate change and help authorities react faster to illegal logging.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, undertook an ambitious art project to reconnect with her classmates after years of feeling isolated by social anxiety. Over the school year, she spent approximately 600 hours painting individual portraits of 44 students she had known since elementary school. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation. Her project not only helped her bridge the social gap she felt but also prompted her peers to reflect on their own relationships and the importance of reaching out.</p>

Henrik Svendsen explained that the tariffs, particularly on goods imported from China, have made his inventory unaffordable for both his business and his customers. He reports having paid approximately $162,000 in tariffs, which he cannot absorb due to slim profit margins, leading to the difficult decision to close the store. The closure will also result in the layoffs of his ten employees, highlighting the direct impact of trade policy on small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The top U.S. general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine, informed senators that the military did not use powerful bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Isfahan nuclear site during recent strikes. The reason cited was that the facility is buried so deep underground that the bombs would likely have been ineffective. While other sites like Fordow and Natanz were hit with bunker-busters, Isfahan was struck by Tomahawk missiles. This revelation provides context to an initial defense intelligence assessment that suggested the strikes likely only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, as core components and enriched uranium may not have been destroyed.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delivered another legal defeat to the Trump administration by striking down an executive order aimed at punishing the law firm Susman Godfrey, marking the fourth such ruling. The judge declared the order unconstitutional, stating it violated the firm's rights and represented an attack on the independence of the American legal system. This series of executive orders has targeted prominent law firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president. While some firms have settled with the administration, four have successfully challenged the orders in court, with judges consistently ruling them to be an overreach of executive power.</p>

The U-turn was made to avoid a parliamentary defeat but has raised deeper questions about the credibility of the government's long-term economic plans. Initially, the cuts were intended to generate short-term savings to meet self-imposed borrowing rules. Critics and independent experts argued the focus should have been on a long-term strategy to help people with health issues return to the workforce, rather than an emergency cost-cutting measure that proved politically untenable.

The agency's primary concern had been a potential radiological accident at major sites like the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, which did not happen.

Many practical questions, such as how citizenship status would be verified at birth, remain unanswered by the White House.

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California from Sunday through Wednesday. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The flights are part of NASA's Student Airborne Research Program, designed to sample atmospheric gasses and measure land and water surfaces. The public may observe the aircraft performing peculiar maneuvers, such as vertical spirals over urban areas and simulated missed landings at airports to collect air samples.</p>

While its founders are planning global expansion, the league faces intense criticism from medical experts who warn of severe risks, including brain injury and death, calling it the "commercialisation of concussion." The debate is intensified by the recent death of a teenager who was reportedly imitating the viral trend.</p>
