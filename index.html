          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded to show a net gain for the year, closing at $410.26 on Monday after a significant downturn in the first quarter. The shares have surged 85% from a low point in early April, boosted by news of CEO Elon Musk purchasing approximately $1 billion worth of company stock through his foundation. Despite this recovery, the electric vehicle manufacturer is still navigating a sales slump due to an aging product line and strong competition from Chinese automakers, while also trying to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets continued their record-setting rally on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite both closing at all-time highs. The gains were driven by strong performances in the tech sector, notably Alphabet, which surpassed a $3 trillion market capitalization, and Tesla, whose stock rose 3.6% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed a major share purchase. Investors are now keenly awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, with widespread expectations for the first cut of the year, which could further influence market direction and economic activity.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is facing intense scrutiny for his frequent and sometimes premature use of social media during the investigation into the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Critics, including former FBI agents, argue that his approach compromises investigative integrity by releasing information in real-time, a stark departure from the traditionally cautious communication style of his predecessors. Patel defended his actions as a commitment to transparency, even after having to retract an early post about a suspect being in custody, stating he has no regrets about his method of keeping the public informed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a second strike against a boat in international waters, allegedly operated by Venezuelan "narcoterrorists," resulting in three fatalities. President Trump announced the operation on social media, warning that the U.S. is actively hunting those transporting illicit drugs that could harm Americans. This action follows a similar strike two weeks prior that killed eleven people and occurs amid heightened tensions between the United States and Venezuela, with the Trump administration accusing President Nicolás Maduro's government of collaborating with drug cartels, a charge Venezuela denies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports to encourage long-term strategic focus over short-term profits. In a social media post, he argued the change would save money and allow managers to better run their companies, contrasting the U.S. system with China's longer-term business perspective.

This rebalancing aims to enhance diversification and reduce concentration risk for investors, subsequently redirecting investment flows toward smaller emerging markets such as Thailand, Poland, South Africa, and Brazil, which are expected to be the primary beneficiaries of the adjustment.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut since late 2024, experts clarify that the decision will not directly or immediately lower mortgage rates. The Fed controls the short-term federal funds rate, whereas fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to long-term instruments like the 10-year Treasury note yield. While adjustable-rate mortgages are more sensitive to the Fed's actions, lenders have largely already priced the anticipated cut into current mortgage rates, which recently fell to their lowest level in nearly a year in anticipation of the central bank's move.</p>

China confirmed the framework but stated any deal must protect the interests of Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>The FBI has revealed that the suspect in the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appeared to have an "obsession" with the conservative influencer based on his digital footprint. FBI Co-Deputy Director Dan Bongino stated that Robinson exhibited multiple warning signs, and investigators are now determining if others were aware of the potential threat. Additionally, FBI Director Kash Patel announced that DNA evidence found on a towel wrapped around the firearm and on a screwdriver from the crime scene definitively links Robinson to the killing at Utah Valley University.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a number of individuals have been fired or disciplined by their employers for public comments about his death. Those affected include a sports reporter, a university employee, an MSNBC analyst, and a U.S. Secret Service agent, whose remarks were deemed inappropriate or harmful to their employers' reputations. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate at-will employees for public speech that violates workplace policy or is perceived as damaging to the business, as First Amendment protections are limited in the private sector.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated this week, financial experts are advising savers on how to protect their returns. The article suggests moving significant funds, such as $10,000, out of traditional low-yield savings accounts. Three recommended alternatives are certificate of deposit (CD) accounts to lock in current high rates, high-yield savings accounts for a balance of returns and liquidity, and money market accounts which offer competitive rates plus check-writing capabilities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a crucial date for self-employed individuals, freelancers, and those with income not subject to withholding, such as from investments. Tax professionals note that recent tax breaks enacted by President Trump could complicate calculations for some filers, who may risk overpaying if they don't adjust for the changes. To avoid underpayment penalties, taxpayers should generally pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's, with a higher threshold for those with incomes over $150,000.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice demanding her job back. Comey, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, alleges she was fired in July without explanation and that the termination was an "unlawful and unconstitutional" act of political retaliation. Her lawsuit claims she was targeted either because of her father's contentious relationship with President Trump or due to her perceived political beliefs, part of a broader pattern of terminations within the DOJ.</p>

          <p>The New England Revolution have fired head coach Caleb Porter following a period of poor results that has left the team highly unlikely to make the MLS playoffs. Porter's tenure lasted less than two seasons, during which the team struggled with injuries and underperformance, culminating in a nine-match winless streak this summer. Assistant coach Pablo Moreira will take over as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. Porter, who has won two MLS Cups with other clubs, has now failed to make the playoffs in seven of his eleven seasons as a head coach.</p>

          <p>A private security guard has been charged after shooting a tourist on the Las Vegas Strip during an altercation in late August. The guard, Deangelo Sneed, allegedly shot the victim in the hip following a fight near the Grand Bazaar Shops. According to police, Sneed was not authorized to carry a firearm as part of his duties for the security company Securitas, and it was against company policy. Sneed, who told police he has no formal firearms training, faces charges including battery with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting to circumvent legal protections for asylum seekers by deporting a group of non-Ghanaian African migrants to Ghana. The judge expressed concern that Ghana intends to return these individuals to their home countries, where they face credible fears of persecution and torture, which would violate U.S. obligations under international law. The ACLU, representing the deportees, argued that the U.S. knowingly sent them to a third country that would not protect them, effectively creating an "end-run" around their legal safeguards.</p>

          <p>Israel's international standing is deteriorating as the war in Gaza continues, with several European nations imposing sanctions and others planning to recognize a Palestinian state. Belgium has banned imports from West Bank settlements and sanctioned two far-right Israeli ministers, while Spain has enacted an arms embargo. This growing diplomatic and economic pressure, including divestment by Norway's sovereign wealth fund and potential boycotts in culture and sports, is leading to comparisons with the international isolation faced by apartheid-era South Africa, though Israel still retains the staunch support of the United States.</p>

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers are reporting confusion and frustration as their loans are transferred between servicing companies, often with little direct notice. One borrower detailed receiving an email from a new servicer, Central Research Inc. (CRI), without prior warning, only to find their loans had been placed in an administrative forbearance. Experts advise that while such transfers are authorized by the Department of Education, borrowers should be cautious about making payments during the transition to avoid processing errors. They also recommend monitoring credit reports to ensure the forbearance is not incorrectly reported as a late payment.</p>
