            <p>Senator Mitch McConnell voiced his support for President Trump's success but expressed skepticism regarding the administration's tariff policies during a gathering in Kentucky.  McConnell, who has historically opposed tariffs, cited past failures of such policies and emphasized the importance of U.S. alliances while challenging China. He highlighted his contributions to Trump's first term, including judicial appointments and tax reform, while affirming his commitment to strengthening America's global leadership in his remaining years in the Senate. The event occurred amidst advice from party leadership against in-person town halls due to contentious constituent reactions to Trump's policies.</p>

            <p>School leaders across the nation are grappling with a Trump administration directive that requires them to recertify their commitment to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits race-based discrimination in federally funded programs, or risk losing federal funds. The order argues that DEI programs may violate civil rights laws, but it lacks a clear definition of what constitutes a violation. States are responding differently, reflecting the ambiguity surrounding DEI and raising concerns about the legality of the administration's demands. The threat of investigations has created a chilling effect in classrooms, causing anxiety among educators.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that Google possesses an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology, siding with the Department of Justice and 17 states in an antitrust case. The ruling stated that Google engaged in anticompetitive acts to maintain its monopoly, harming publishers and consumers. Google intends to appeal the decision, arguing that its ad tech tools are effective and that the case overlooked other large ad tech providers. This is the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year, following a ruling that it also has a monopoly on online search.</p>

            <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that Powell is too slow in cutting interest rates and that his "termination cannot come fast enough." Trump's remarks follow Powell's warnings about the potential economic consequences of the administration's trade war, which could reignite inflation.  Trump pointed to the European Central Bank's rate cuts and claimed that tariffs are enriching the U.S., while also asserting that Powell would leave his position if asked.  Despite Trump's criticism, Powell has defended the Fed's independence, and his term ends in 2026.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has filed a motion with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals seeking a stay of the injunction and discovery orders issued by a district judge in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The case centered on the murder of Korey Kauffman, a scrap-metal thief, and involved an 18-month preliminary hearing and a 17-month trial.

Experts highlight the complexity of autism research, emphasizing the need for a multi-disciplinary approach and years of study. While some welcome increased focus and funding for autism research, they caution against rushing to conclusions and stress the importance of supporting individuals with autism. Kennedy claims that environmental factors are the cause of autism, despite the meta analysis that indicates genetic risk of autism is between 60% and 90%.</p>

The lack of clarity on U.S. tariffs is creating challenges for businesses that rely on imported goods and packaging from China. Prolonged economic uncertainty is dampening consumer spending and hindering strategic planning for small businesses. Some businesses are exploring alternative strategies, such as selling to markets outside the U.S., to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>
