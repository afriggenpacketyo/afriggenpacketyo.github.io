          <p>The United States is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Baghdad due to heightened security risks amid escalating tensions with Iran. Non-essential staff and their families are being advised to leave Iraq, following reports that Israel was prepared to launch an operation into Iran, which could prompt Iranian retaliation against US sites in Iraq. Despite the evacuation, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff plans to proceed with talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program. President Trump reiterated that the US will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and emphasized the potential dangers in the region, adding that Americans were advised to leave the region "because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens".</p>

          <p>A curfew has been enacted for the second consecutive night in Los Angeles following widespread unrest sparked by recent US immigration raids. The protests, which began last Friday, have resulted in nearly 400 arrests, including undocumented migrants and individuals charged with assault and obstruction. Mayor Karen Bass attributed the demonstrations to President Trump's immigration policies, accusing them of provoking fear and panic among residents, with 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to help quell the unrest. The military deployment to the LA area will cost $134m (Â£99m), the Pentagon said.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States, Chinese companies are continuing to expand their presence in the US market. Camera company Insta360, for instance, recently raised a significant amount of capital and counts the US as one of its largest markets. This trend reflects a broader strategy among Chinese firms to build international brands and establish a global presence, driven partly by slower growth in the domestic Chinese market. Chinese companies are increasingly looking to establish international brands with offices in different regions, hiring local employees, and building global supply chains to offset tariff risks.

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Leon Brittan, has criticized the decision to drop an investigation into the officer who led an inquiry into false sexual assault claims against her late husband. She expressed a lack of trust in the Met Police and the police watchdog, stating that the misconduct proceedings against Met Police officer Steve Rodhouse had been "quietly dropped". Lord Brittan was falsely accused of being part of a paedophile ring in Westminster, with the claims fabricated by Carl Beech. Lady Brittan feels her husband's legacy has been permanently tarnished despite his name being cleared.</p>

          <p>The surviving original members of the Beach Boys have paid tribute to Brian Wilson, their legendary frontman and co-founder, who has died at the age of 82. Fellow musicians recognized his "genius", with Mike Love saying his "musical gifts were unmatched" and had "changed the course of music forever", and Sir Elton John described him as a "true giant" who had the "biggest influence" on his songwriting. Rolling Stone ranked them at 12 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". Wilson churned out dozens of hit singles, including the three number one songs I Get Around, Help Me, Rhonda and Good Vibrations.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines reveal diverse reactions to the chancellor's Spending Review, with some papers describing it as a plan for "renewing Britain" while others criticize it as a "reckless splurge". The NHS and defense are highlighted as "big winners," but some departments may face fiscal challenges. Some articles warn of inevitable tax increases to balance the books, while others welcome the review as a shift away from austerity. The spending plans are also seen as a bid to improve Labour's chances in the next election, with concerns raised about the impact on public services.</p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, revealing a dark legacy of the Cold War. The Mace B cruise missile launch site, built during the US military occupation, is the last of four such sites constructed in the 1960s. The missiles, deployed in Okinawa in the first half of the 1960s, could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union, and were reportedly made ready for war during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The site serves as a reminder of the presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa during the Cold War era.</p>

          <p>Japan has strongly urged China to prevent a recurrence of near-miss incidents involving military aircraft, following a recent encounter between a Chinese warplane and a Japanese patrol plane. Japan has conveyed its "serious concern" to China over the incident that could have led to a collision, adding it will continue to maintain communication at various levels. The Chinese fighter jet passed in front of the MSDF P-3C at the same altitude on Sunday at a distance of around 900 meters, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry.
