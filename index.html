          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed cautious optimism about potential direct talks with Russia, emphasizing the necessity of an immediate cease-fire. This response followed Russia's offer of negotiations in Istanbul, although without initially agreeing to a cease-fire. European leaders, having visited Kyiv, set a deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day truce or face additional sanctions, aligning with U.S. demands. President Trump urged both sides to meet, hoping to determine the feasibility of a deal. Amid these diplomatic efforts, Russia resumed drone attacks on Ukraine, complicating the already tense situation and raising concerns about the sincerity of Russia's willingness to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with details to be released on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a deal had been reached, emphasizing the speed of the agreement. The Trump administration initiated these talks to address the significant trade imbalance, viewing it as a national emergency. China's Vice Premier He Lifeng described the discussions as candid and constructive, agreeing to establish a consultation mechanism for economic and trade issues, as both sides aim to ease tensions and potentially lower tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains. The resolution of this trade war has major implications for the global economy, which has been affected by tariffs imposed by both countries.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced the imminent release of Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American soldier held hostage since October 7, 2023, as part of ongoing ceasefire negotiations. The statement highlighted the group's "positivity" in response to mediation efforts aimed at reopening crossings and delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. Alexander, a 20-year-old from New Jersey, was abducted from a military base during the initial Hamas attack. His parents have been actively advocating for his release, meeting with former Presidents Biden and Trump to push for a hostage deal. The release is contingent on progress towards a ceasefire, providing a glimmer of hope amidst the protracted conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>A proposed budget by President Trump aims to streamline funding for special education, raising concerns among parents of the 7.5 million public school students served by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The plan suggests limiting federal oversight and granting states greater flexibility, which could lead to uneven enforcement of educational standards for students with disabilities. One example is a case in Oklahoma where a student with Down syndrome was placed in segregated classrooms, limiting her interactions with nondisabled peers. The author argues that without federal oversight, states may not meet the minimum requirements of IDEA, potentially eroding the promise of a free and appropriate public education for students with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent expression of a desire to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced underlying tensions within the British royal family. This public appeal, made during an interview, has drawn attention back to the rift that emerged when Harry and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties. Royal commentators suggest that this ongoing family drama could negatively impact King Charles' reign, potentially undermining his messages of unity and inclusiveness. The palace has declined to comment directly on the relationship but pushed back on Harry's claims regarding security arrangements, further complicating the narrative.</p>

Democrats are hoping to persuade voters that the Trump administration is negatively impacting their lives.

          <p>Democratic Congress members Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Rob Menendez accused Trump administration homeland security officials of instigating the confrontation that led to the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka at an ICE detention center. The representatives, who visited Delaney Hall for an oversight inspection, claimed that officials escalated the situation, leading to Baraka's arrest for trespassing. Homeland security officials have accused the Congress members of staging a "bizarre political stunt" and threatened to arrest them. The controversy surrounds the reopening of Delaney Hall, a private prison operated by Geo Group, which has faced legal challenges in New Jersey.</p>
