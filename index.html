        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts disagree on whether Alex Murdaugh will receive a new murder trial after Becky Hill, the former Colleton County court clerk, faced felony charges of obstructing justice, misconduct, and perjury. The charges stem from allegations that Hill misused her position, including sharing sealed exhibits with the press and lying to the South Carolina Supreme Court. While some legal analysts believe the charges could bolster Murdaugh's appeal, others argue that the absence of jury tampering charges weakens his case. Murdaugh was convicted in 2023 for the murders of his wife and son.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the increasing disparity between the rich and the average person, arguing that wealth accumulation has far outpaced income equality measures. It proposes the concept of an 'extreme wealth line,' similar to the poverty line, to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful to society. The article suggests that excessive wealth can grant undue political influence, cause environmental damage, and undermine economic competition. The author calls for a democratic process to determine this line and implement policies to curb extreme wealth accumulation, such as higher taxes or mandated charitable donations.</p>

          <p>Germany has tightened its border controls, particularly at the Austro-German border, to combat illegal immigration. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced that asylum-seekers will now be turned back at the border, with exceptions only for vulnerable individuals. This move represents a shift from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum policy and aims to address concerns over people smuggling and illegal migration. The increased border controls have led to a rise in thwarted illegal entry attempts, but the policy has faced criticism from neighboring countries like Poland, who prefer to combat illegal immigration at the EU's external borders.</p>

The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. It suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers.

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans, possibly with assistance from jail staff, prompting a manhunt. The inmates escaped through a hole in a cell wall and were seen on surveillance video leaving the facility in civilian clothes. Three of the escapees have been captured, but seven remain at large, including four charged with second-degree murder. Authorities are investigating security failures and the possibility of internal assistance, offering rewards for information leading to the capture of the remaining escapees.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has implemented a range of tariffs against various countries and industries, though many have been paused or modified. Tariffs currently in effect include a 10% universal tariff, 25% on cars and auto parts, 30% on Chinese imports, and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by the USMCA. Higher tariffs on Chinese goods and 'reciprocal' tariffs have been paused. Exemptions have been made for goods from Canada and Mexico covered by the USMCA, as well as smartphones, computers, and other electronics imported from China. The future of these policies remains uncertain.</p>

The United Nations has warned of widespread hunger among Gaza's population due to a blockade imposed by Israel, while Hamas has vowed not to release remaining hostages unless Israel ends the war and withdraws from Gaza.</p>
