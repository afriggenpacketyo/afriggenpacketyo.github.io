            <p>Canada's major federal party leaders engaged in their final debate before the upcoming election, addressing key issues such as trade relations with the U.S., affordability, crime, and environmental policy. Liberal leader Mark Carney faced scrutiny over his association with the previous, unpopular Trudeau administration, while leaders debated strategies for dealing with U.S. tariffs. The debate also highlighted differing visions for Canada's future, with discussions on housing, social programs, and the role of government in addressing crises. Smaller parties fought for attention amid polls indicating a strong lead for the Conservatives and Liberals.</p>

            <p>Millions of travelers are expected to experience disruptions during the Easter weekend due to planned rail engineering works, potential airport strikes, and heavy road traffic. Network Rail is carrying out over 300 maintenance projects, including a major closure at London Euston, impacting services to Milton Keynes and the West Coast Main Line. Road travel is also anticipated to be congested, with warnings of "big jams" on major routes, prompting travelers to plan ahead and prepare for longer journeys. Gatwick Airport is bracing for strikes by ground handling staff, potentially affecting several airlines.</p>

            <p>Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu will increase prices in the US starting April 25, citing changes in global trade rules and tariffs. The companies, known for budget-friendly goods sourced from China, attribute the price hikes to rising operating costs. The de minimis exemption, allowing packages under $800 to enter the US duty-free, will no longer apply to Chinese goods starting May 2, coupled with new tariffs of up to 245%. This shift in US trade policy is expected to significantly impact the platforms' cost structures.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction restricting the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) access to personalized Social Security data, citing privacy concerns. The judge ordered DOGE staffers to purge non-anonymized data received since January and restricted changes to SSA software. The ruling allows access to redacted data after training and background checks. The case was brought by labor unions and retirees alleging privacy violations and security risks, highlighting a debate over balancing efficiency with data protection at the Social Security Administration.</p>

Patients are urged to check their medication and contact their GP or pharmacist if they have the wrongly-labeled product.

            <p>A coroner has called for stricter eyesight regulations for motorists, deeming the current enforcement of visual standards as "ineffective and unsafe" following inquests into four deaths caused by drivers with impaired vision. The coroner's report highlights that the UK relies on self-reporting of visual conditions and lacks mandatory visual checks for drivers up to age 70, making it an outlier in Europe. The report urges action to prevent future deaths, citing cases where drivers with known sight deficiencies failed to declare them to the DVLA, resulting in fatal collisions.</p>

The Trump administration has accused Mr. Ábrego García of being a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyers deny. A federal court ruled against the administration, potentially leading to depositions of government officials over the deportation. The Supreme Court has ordered the US government to "facilitate" his return, but El Salvador's President has said the detainee will remain in the country's custody.</p>

            <p>Climate change is not merely a problem of physics, but a crisis of justice deeply rooted in inequality and colonial structures. Extreme weather events disproportionately affect vulnerable populations due to poverty, lack of infrastructure, and social inequalities, exacerbated by historical colonial practices. The focus on climate change as a physics problem obscures the underlying social and political factors that determine its impact. Addressing the climate crisis requires transforming social participation and the application of political and economic power, challenging the dominance of patriarchal and colonial structures.</p>

            <p>Mexico's governing party, Morena, achieved significant electoral success by focusing on socioeconomic justice, contrasting with the global trend of far-right gains. López Obrador's populist narrative, promising to combat corruption and inequality, resonated with voters and led to increased social spending and poverty reduction. However, Morena also adopted right-leaning positions, including fiscal austerity and a crackdown on migrants, raising questions about the party's true values. While Morena's success offers insights for progressives, its blend of left and right-wing policies may not be universally desirable or replicable.</p>

Common mistakes include exceeding recommended dosages, misdiagnosing ailments, and unknowingly combining multiple pain relievers. Acetaminophen is generally better for fevers, while NSAIDs are more effective for inflammatory pain, but both carry risks if taken incorrectly. Health professionals recommend consulting a pharmacist for guidance on choosing the right painkiller and dosage. It's also important to be aware of combination drugs and consider non-pill options like topical creams or nonmedication remedies.</p>

            <p>The NHL's playoff format, which prioritizes divisional matchups, is facing criticism for creating predictable and repetitive first-round series.
