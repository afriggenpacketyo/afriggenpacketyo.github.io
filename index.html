          <p>Cleveland Browns star defensive end Myles Garrett was cited for speeding after being caught driving 100 mph in a 60 mph zone near the team's facility in Berea, Ohio. This incident marks Garrett's eighth speeding citation in the Cleveland area since being drafted in 2017 and follows a more serious incident in 2022 where he flipped his Porsche while speeding. The team is aware of the situation and plans to address it internally. The citation highlights a recurring off-field issue for the team, as another player was also recently cited for similar offenses.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to prolong their ongoing trade truce, officially suspending the implementation of drastically higher tariffs for an additional 90-day period. This extension, confirmed just hours before the previous deadline expired, maintains the current U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports at 30% and Chinese duties on American goods at 10%. The White House stated that the delay provides crucial time for further negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and what it terms as unfair trade practices. Despite this temporary stability, official figures show that trade flows between the world's two largest economies have already contracted significantly this year compared to 2024.

Among the injured, five individuals were last reported to be in critical but stable condition, while the other five were released from the hospital.

          <p>Law enforcement sources have confirmed the arrest of four individuals suspected in a series of burglaries across Los Angeles, which included a break-in at actor Brad Pitt's home. The incident at Pitt's Los Feliz residence occurred in June while the actor was out of the country promoting a film. The suspects allegedly scaled a security fence, smashed a window, and stole valuable items after ransacking the property. The arrests were made by the Los Angeles Police Department in South L.A. following an ongoing investigation into what appears to be an organized burglary ring.</p>

          <p>The Chinese-made Wing Loong-2 (WL-2) unmanned aerial vehicle has become a prominent fixture in global conflicts and a cornerstone of China's own military drone program. This medium-altitude, long-endurance reconnaissance and strike drone, often compared to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper, has been successfully exported to numerous countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Domestically, a variant known as the GJ-2 serves as a primary platform for the People's Liberation Army for surveillance and combat missions. The drone's success is attributed to its proven combat capabilities and its position as a cost-effective alternative in the international arms market.</p>

          <p>The working-class community of Huntington Park, California, is experiencing a significant economic and social downturn as residents live in constant fear of increased immigration raids. The city, which is over 95% Latino, has seen its once-bustling commercial streets become eerily quiet, resembling what some call a 'ghost town.' Many local businesses now keep their doors locked during operating hours, asking customers to knock for entry in an effort to create a sense of safety from federal agents. City officials worry that this climate of fear is severely impacting local tax revenue, which funds essential community services.</p>

Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, previously questioning its methodology and calling for major changes at the agency.

However, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and official data contradict this narrative, pointing to a significant decline in violent crime in 2025, reaching a 30-year low. While the mayor stated the city would comply with the law, she described the federal intervention as deeply "unsettling."</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions Factual Basis for Trump's Federal Intervention in Washington D.C.</h2>

          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize D.C. police, portraying the city as "lawless," relies on misleading and outdated crime statistics, according to an analysis of official data. While the president focused on a 2023 homicide spike, violent crime in the capital has fallen dramatically in 2025 to a 30-year low, a fact this article emphasizes. The report notes a pattern of using false narratives, drawing parallels to his previous justifications for deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles. Experts and local officials maintain that the drastic federal intervention is not supported by the current reality of crime trends in Washington D.C. or other major cities.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI research, have filed a formal whistleblowing complaint warning that the prestigious organization is at risk of collapse. The complaint follows a threat from the UK's Technology Secretary to withdraw public funding unless the institute pivots its focus primarily to defense and national security research. In the letter, employees allege misuse of public funds, a "toxic internal culture," and a failure to deliver on its core scientific mission. The government has stated it wants the publicly funded institute to provide "real value for money for taxpayers."</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter revealed she felt a "sigh of relief" when white teammates also missed penalties in a crucial shootout, fearing her Black teammate Lauren James would have faced "astronomical" racist abuse if she had been the only one to miss. Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, spoke out about the devastating psychological impact of the abuse on players. She described feeling small, invaluable, and even scared to play in the final due to the threat of racist attacks. The Football Association has referred the abuse to the police for investigation.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of a missing Scottish cyclist, Tony Parsons, was solved after his killer's new girlfriend bravely went to the police with crucial information. The killer, Alexander McKellar, confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried the body in a remote location. After McKellar showed her the shallow grave, she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later contacted authorities. This clever and courageous act led police directly to the site, allowing them to recover Parsons' body and bring a long-awaited resolution to his family.</p>

          <p>A Sky News analysis suggests President Trump's federal crackdown on crime in Washington D.C. is strategically timed to project an image of strength ahead of his upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin. The article argues that the domestic show of force is intended to position Trump as a bold and uncompromising leader on the world stage before the high-stakes meeting. It also highlights a gaffe where Trump conflated his trip to Alaska with going to Russia, revealing how central Putin is to his current political narrative. The summit will notably exclude Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, focusing solely on a bilateral power play.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and members of his cabinet, describing the executive's story as a "success" in a significant reversal of his previous stance. Just days earlier, the president had publicly called for Tan's immediate resignation on social media, citing concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton about the CEO's alleged ties to China. Following what was described as a "candid and constructive discussion," Trump indicated that Tan and his cabinet would bring him suggestions on technology and manufacturing policy. The shift highlights the administration's volatile but hands-on approach to the semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>A new 51-story residential skyscraper has received official approval from the Los Angeles City Council for a location in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The proposed tower is planned to contain 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not yet commented on a construction start date, as the project faces a challenging financial climate for new construction. Industry experts note that high interest rates, tariffs on materials, and rising labor costs have created significant uncertainty for many developers, despite high demand for housing in the city.</p>

          <p>New details have emerged about the recent attack on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, revealing the gunman fired over 180 shots into the campus. The barrage broke approximately 150 windows, some of which were "blast-resistant," and caused extensive damage to at least four separate buildings. The attacker, who had blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his mental health issues, killed a police officer before he died. The incident has intensified concerns about the real-world impact of anti-science rhetoric on the safety of public health officials and institutions.</p>
