          <p>The BBC reports on the critical condition of five-month-old Siwar Ashour, a baby in Gaza suffering from severe malnutrition due to an allergic reaction and the shortage of specialized formula caused by the ongoing war and Israeli blockade. The article describes the harrowing circumstances faced by Siwar and her family, who are struggling to find food and clean water amidst the destruction and displacement. The BBC correspondent recounts his colleague's emotional distress witnessing the suffering of children in Gaza, highlighting the immense challenges faced by civilians trapped in the conflict zone. Despite Israeli claims of no food shortage, aid agencies report severe shortages, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration's changes to the academy, citing the end of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and the introduction of ideological censorship. Parsons expressed concern over the administration's efforts to indoctrinate rather than educate, leading to the elimination of courses and modification of syllabi to align with the administration's views. He felt professionally betrayed by the administration's interference, which banned his research agenda and conveyed a message to cadets that certain areas of inquiry were illegitimate. Parsons views this as a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for allegedly monetizing the presidency, with the Trump family and business partners reportedly collecting millions through cryptocurrency ventures, overseas real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. Qatar's donation of a luxury jet for Mr. Trump's use and the hosting of an exclusive dinner for investors in the $TRUMP cryptocurrency are raising ethical questions. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled instruments of accountability and normalized moneymaking schemes that would have previously provoked outrage and investigation. Despite concerns, the White House defends Trump's actions, stating he abides by applicable conflict of interest laws. (not investment advice)</p>

This proposal emerged at a meeting of federal judges following Trump's criticism of court rulings against his policies. The judges worry that Trump might instruct the US marshals service, currently under the Justice Department's control, to withdraw protection from judges ruling against him. The move would place the US marshals service under the direct authority of the Chief Justice.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson indicated that there is enough resistance among GOP senators to potentially stall President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" unless significant changes are made. Johnson cited concerns about the bill increasing the deficit and the need for deeper spending cuts. Other senators, like Rand Paul, have voiced objections to raising the debt ceiling within the bill. The bill faces a potentially difficult path through the Senate, where any changes would require it to return to the House.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's election victory, the Democratic Party is struggling to find a path forward, facing low approval ratings and a sense of cultural rejection. The party is grappling with losses in key demographics, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos, and a perception of being the party of college-educated elites. The Democratic base is frustrated with the Trump administration's actions and the perceived lack of resistance from congressional leaders. The party is now reassessing its messaging, policies, and leadership to rebuild its standing with voters.</p>

          <p>A second major power outage in two days struck southeastern France, this time in Nice, after an electrical facility was damaged by suspected arson. The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, attributed the outage to "malicious acts," and a criminal investigation has been opened. Approximately 45,000 households were affected by the blackout, which disrupted tram services and briefly impacted Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport. Authorities are investigating whether the incident is linked to a similar power outage that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival the previous day.</p>

She stated that the program needs to get in at scale, with more trucks going to the correct places, as only about 100 trucks are currently being allowed to enter, compared to 600 a day during the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Despite a pledge to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG). While promoting the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) for regional cooperation on net-zero emissions, Japan's investments often prioritize natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage, which critics argue amounts to "greenwashing." This approach allows Japan to secure its energy needs while also exporting surplus LNG, raising concerns about hindering the transition to renewable energy in partner countries like Indonesia.</p>
