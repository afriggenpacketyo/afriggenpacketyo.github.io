Swiatek's defeat follows the earlier exits of other top-seeded players, including Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula, marking a series of surprising upsets in the tournament. Meanwhile, four-time major winner Naomi Osaka advanced decisively to the quarter-finals, seeking her first title since returning from maternity leave. Tauson will now face American Madison Keys, who also advanced after a hard-fought victory.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is in its fourth day for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider Brown armed and dangerous, and a reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest. The small, tight-knit community is in shock, as the suspect was reportedly a regular at the bar and knew the victims.

          <p>Over three thousand Boeing defense workers have initiated a strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer concerning pay, schedules, and pensions. The strike, led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, affects facilities that build military aircraft like the F-15 fighter jet. This labor action represents a new challenge for the aviation giant, which is already grappling with safety-related crises and financial difficulties from previous issues. The union states its members deserve a contract that fairly reflects their critical role in national defense.</p>

          <p>Mexico's Cruz Azul kept their Leagues Cup hopes alive by defeating the LA Galaxy 8-7 in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in regular time. The match, played at Dignity Health Sports Park, saw Cruz Azul rebound from a humiliating 7-0 loss in their previous game. Carlos Rodríguez scored for Cruz Azul in the first half, but the Galaxy equalized late in the game through Pec, forcing the shootout. The result gives Cruz Azul two points, enough to mathematically remain in contention in the tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Manchester City's recent strategic changes, suggesting a significant tactical evolution under manager Pep Guardiola. The most notable move is the hiring of Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former right-hand man at Liverpool, which hints at a shift towards a more direct, high-transition style of play. This is further supported by recent player acquisitions like Omar Marmoush and Rayan Cherki, who excel at carrying the ball and dribbling. These changes suggest Guardiola is adapting his famous possession-based philosophy to counter the increasingly aggressive pressing tactics seen in modern Premier League football.</p>

          <p>New violence has erupted in Syria, testing the authority of the transitional government and a delicate ceasefire. In the north, government-affiliated fighters clashed with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), while in the southern province of Sweida, they fought with Druze armed groups. These outbreaks challenge the interim government's efforts to consolidate control and integrate different regions following the ouster of Bashar Assad. The incidents highlight the deep-seated tensions among Syria's various ethnic, religious, and political factions as the country navigates a precarious political transition.</p>

          <p>Rescue efforts at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have concluded with the tragic discovery of the bodies of all five miners who were trapped. The miners became stranded three days prior after a section of the world's largest underground copper mine collapsed following a 4.2 magnitude earthquake. An investigation is underway to determine if the tremor was natural or caused by mining activity, and a criminal probe will assess potential safety violations. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, has expressed deep regret over the outcome.</p>

          <p>South Korea has begun removing loudspeakers that broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages across its border, a move aimed at de-escalating tensions with North Korea. This action follows the administration of President Lee Jae-myung's decision to halt the broadcasts in June to "restore trust," which was reciprocated by Pyongyang. The gesture is part of Seoul's broader effort to revive dialogue, though North Korea has recently rejected these overtures.

          <p>China's electric vehicle market is showing signs of strain from an ongoing price war, with industry leader BYD reporting its first monthly delivery decline of the year in July. Other major players like Li Auto and Nio also saw drops, while competitors such as Xpeng and Xiaomi posted growth, indicating a significant market reshuffling. The intense competition, which saw BYD discount some models by 30%, has prompted warnings from Chinese policymakers to curb excessive price cutting.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the current political landscape in the UK and US is defined by a dangerous paradox: fragmenting public support but a persistent monopoly of power by establishment parties. The author suggests that while new movements and parties are emerging, they face immense pressure and are unlikely to break the hold of entrenched systems like Labour and the Democrats. This leads to a state of permanent disaffection, where governments are unable to solve major crises but remain in power due to systemic advantages. The risk is a new, miserable status quo of escalating public rage and impotent governance.</p>

          <p>Germany's birth rate has fallen to a new low of 1.35 children per woman, sparking a national debate about demographic decline and societal values. Experts attribute the trend to multiple factors, including economic uncertainty, the climate crisis, and high inflation, which particularly affect the younger generation's decision to have children. While some women are deliberately choosing to be child-free, sociologists point to a significant "fertility gap" where many people desire more children than they have. The article suggests that improved family-friendly policies, such as reliable childcare, are crucial to reversing the trend and avoiding long-term economic strain.</p>

It is believed that approximately 20 living hostages remain in captivity since the October 7th attack.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Tuxpan prison in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has left seven inmates dead and eleven others injured, according to regional authorities. The unrest, which included fires set within the facility, reportedly broke out due to inmate anger over extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization inside the prison. The incident highlights ongoing issues in Mexico's prison system, including overcrowding and the powerful influence of cartels and gangs. The Tuxpan prison was holding more inmates than its designed capacity at the time of the riot.</p>

          <p>Eight decades after the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima, efforts continue on the nearby island of Ninoshima to find the remains of thousands of victims. Following the blast, the island's quarantine center became a makeshift hospital for the dead and dying, many of whom were buried in mass, unmarked graves. Researchers and local historians are still working to locate these remains to provide closure for survivors and honor the dead. The ongoing search serves as a somber reminder of the bombing's devastating human toll and the lasting trauma it inflicted on the region's communities.</p>

          <p>China has firmly rejected U.S. demands to stop buying oil from Russia and Iran, stating it will protect its national interests and sovereignty. The response came after two days of trade negotiations where the U.S. threatened a 100% tariff if China did not comply. Washington aims to restrict revenue for Moscow and Tehran, but Beijing has pushed back, asserting that coercion will not work. This stance underscores a significant point of contention even as both nations express optimism about reaching a broader trade deal, highlighting China's confidence in its strategic energy and foreign policies.

          <p>A collaborative mission between biologists in Cuba and the UK is underway to save the endangered Polymita tree snails, often called the world's most beautiful snails. These snails, native to eastern Cuba, possess vibrant, multi-colored shells that have unfortunately made them a target for the illegal shell trade, pushing them toward extinction. The project aims to understand the snails' genetics, establish a captive breeding program, and provide crucial information for conservation efforts. Researchers hope to protect these unique creatures from the combined threats of habitat loss, climate change, and poaching driven by their own beauty.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for motorists who were mis-sold car finance due to hidden commission deals. The announcement follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while narrowing the scope for claims, found some deals with particularly large commissions were unfair. The FCA will consult on the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with the first payouts expected next year. The scandal involves discretionary commission arrangements, banned in 2021, where dealers were incentivized to charge customers higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The rollout, described by NHS England as a world-first, will initially target those at highest risk, such as gay and bisexual men with multiple partners. The 4CMenB vaccine, originally for meningitis B, is 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea and is hoped to prevent up to 100,000 cases. Health officials and charities see this as a significant step forward in sexual health, especially in slowing the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of the infection.</p>

The report highlights the vulnerability of the children, many of whom are orphans, and the normalization of the illegal trade in the community.
