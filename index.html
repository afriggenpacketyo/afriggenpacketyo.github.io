          <p>A significant number of young people in Germany show interest in starting their own companies, but few follow through due to financial insecurity, lack of networks, and limited business knowledge. The article highlights the success of Knowunity, a peer-to-peer learning app founded by teenagers, as an example of untapped potential. Researchers suggest that providing basic startup security, such as a guaranteed income for the first year, could significantly encourage more young entrepreneurs. The discussion emphasizes the need for better support systems, including mentorship and integrating entrepreneurship into school curricula, to help translate youthful ambition into successful business ventures.</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, the celebrated British-Indian athlete widely recognized as the world's oldest marathon runner, has died at 114 after being struck by a car in his native village in Punjab, India. Known as the 'Turbaned Tornado,' Singh gained international fame in 2011 by becoming the first centenarian to complete a marathon. He had taken up running at age 89 to cope with personal loss and became an inspirational figure, participating in numerous races and serving as a torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics. His death has prompted condolences from prominent figures as local police investigate the hit-and-run incident.</p>

          <p>In a major blow to one of Mexico's most notorious drug trafficking organizations, U.S. drug enforcement agents have seized more than $10 million in cryptocurrency linked to the Sinaloa cartel. The seizure was part of a broader nationwide operation that also confiscated vast quantities of fentanyl and methamphetamine. This action highlights the increasing use of digital currencies by criminal enterprises for money laundering and other illicit activities. The operation underscores the DEA's strategy of targeting the financial networks of cartels to disrupt their operations, coming shortly after a key member of the Guzman family pleaded guilty to drug charges.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's inflation rate rose unexpectedly to 3.6% in the year to June, its fastest pace since January 2024, driven by higher costs for food, clothing, and transport. This development complicates the economic outlook, as the Bank of England had been expected to cut interest rates next month despite inflation remaining above its 2% target. The Office for National Statistics noted that while fuel prices are lower than a year ago, the recent smaller drop contributed to the increase. The persistent inflation continues to squeeze household budgets, particularly for those on lower incomes who are more affected by rising prices for daily necessities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is poised to announce its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating strong results driven by recent market trends.

Furthermore, a rebound in investment banking activities, such as mergers and debt issuance, is projected to boost the firm's revenue. The recovery in stock prices also bodes well for its asset and wealth management division, positioning the bank for a potentially favorable quarter following strong reports from rivals like JPMorgan Chase.

This move is part of a broader strategy using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows for tariffs on national security grounds. The policy could impact major drugmakers and tech companies, and it risks increasing consumer prices for essential goods like medicine and electronics, escalating the global trade conflict.

          <p>Ten years after a catastrophic flood on the Blanco River killed 12 people and destroyed hundreds of structures, the town of Wimberley, Texas, continues its recovery. The community has implemented new safety measures, including additional river gauges, but recent deadly flooding in a nearby county has renewed calls for more robust preparedness, such as a citywide siren system. Residents and business owners recount the trauma of the 2015 event and describe the long, expensive, and emotional process of rebuilding with future flood risks in mind. The story highlights the persistent threat of extreme weather and the challenges of funding disaster-resilience infrastructure.</p>

The tax incentive for home solar and other energy-efficient upgrades like heat pumps will expire on December 31, while the credit of up to $7,500 for new EVs will end on September 30. Experts advise consumers interested in these technologies to act quickly to sign contracts and complete installations to ensure eligibility. The removal of these incentives is expected to slow the pace of EV adoption and green home upgrades, despite their long-term benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to begin debate on a contentious spending-cut package requested by the Trump administration, requiring a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. The proposal aims to rescind $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $7.9 billion from international aid programs. The measure faced opposition from three Republican senators—Collins, Murkowski, and McConnell—who joined Democrats, citing a lack of detail from the administration and concerns over the impact on their states. The bill now faces a series of amendment votes before a final decision.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly delayed, and may potentially cancel, approximately $140 million in federal grants intended to fund efforts combating the fentanyl overdose crisis. According to anonymous CDC staff, this disruption to the Overdose To Action (OD2A) program is causing uncertainty and could lead to layoffs and program shutdowns in the 49 states and numerous local health departments that rely on the funds. The delay appears to stem from bureaucratic confusion involving the White House's cost-cutting initiatives. Public health officials warn that any cuts would be catastrophic, potentially reversing recent progress made in reducing overdose deaths across the country.</p>

          <p>The recorder, a simple plastic wind instrument, has served as the first musical experience for millions of schoolchildren for generations, though its use is declining. Educators praise it as an ideal teaching tool because it is inexpensive, easy to produce a sound on, and perfectly sized for small hands, making it effective for teaching music fundamentals. Originating as a serious instrument during the Renaissance, famously played by King Henry VIII, it was later revived and mass-produced as an educational tool in the 20th century. Despite its reputation as a children's toy, experts note it is a complex instrument to master.</p>

          <p>The Southernism "y'all" has become an increasingly popular second-person plural pronoun across the United States, particularly among younger generations. Linguists attribute its rise to its utility in filling a gap in standard English, its inclusive and welcoming nature, and its spread through migration and cultural influence, including hip-hop and country music. The word's origins are believed to be a blend of Scots-Irish and West African influences. Its adoption by diverse groups, including queer communities, as a gender-neutral and casual yet respectful term has helped propel it from a regional dialect word into the American mainstream.</p>

          <p>Germany is struggling to expand its high-voltage electricity grid at a pace that matches its rapid growth in renewable energy generation. The country needs new "electricity highways" to transport wind power from the north to industrial centers in the south, but the process is mired in delays. Despite plans established over a decade ago, lengthy approval procedures, skilled labor shortages, and supply bottlenecks have significantly hampered progress. Transmission operators and regulators are now debating reforms, such as changing how grid fees are collected, to accelerate construction and avoid public backlash over rising electricity costs, which could further stall this critical project.</p>

Most German states rotate their summer break slots annually to manage travel and tourism demand, but the two southern states always have their holidays last, a tradition linked to Pentecost. Critics claim this forces families in other states to travel during peak, high-cost periods. Leaders in the south are resisting calls for change, asserting that their established holiday rhythm is part of their regional identity, setting up a political clash over this arrangement.</p>

A key factor was a 15% sales drop in Japan, where a strengthening yen has curbed the tourist spending boom seen last year when the currency was weaker. This slowdown in Japan highlights the significant impact of currency fluctuations on the global luxury sector, which had previously benefited from an influx of shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>
