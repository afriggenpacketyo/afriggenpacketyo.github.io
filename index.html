            <p>Shares of Maersk, a major shipping company and indicator of global trade, experienced a significant 10% increase after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for certain countries. This decision provided relief to the maritime and transport sector, which had been concerned about the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. Maersk had previously warned that Trump's tariffs would negatively impact the global economy, stability, and trade, and they are assessing the updated outlook on global trade following this development. The company had also cautioned about the inflationary effects of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China.</p>

            <p>Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio suggested that President Trump's tariff pause was a positive step, advocating for a 'win-win' trade deal with China to address trade imbalances. Dalio emphasized the need for major changes to debt and monetary orders to resolve debt, trade, and capital imbalances. He proposed that Trump should aim to cut the U.S. deficit to 3% of GDP and negotiate a deal that appreciates the RMB against the dollar, achieved through China selling dollar assets and stimulating their demand. Dalio believes this approach would benefit both nations involved. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Starmer is expected to announce plans for dedicated police teams focused on patrolling town centers during peak times in England and Wales. The Labour government aims to address the policing 'postcode lottery' by ensuring every community has specialist neighborhood officers and boost police ranks by 13,000 by 2029. The plan involves patrols in 'hotspot' areas during the busiest periods, such as Friday and Saturday nights, with an anti-social behavior lead in every force expected to develop tailored action plans with residents and businesses. The announcement comes as police forces face severe financial challenges, despite recent funding increases.</p>

The Attorney General had previously announced Villatoro Santos's arrest in a highly publicized operation, emphasizing his imminent removal from the country.

            <p>President Trump's social media post urging investors to 'BUY!!! DJT' preceded his announcement of a 90-day tariff pause, leading to significant market gains. The S&P 500 gained back about $4 trillion, or 70%, of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days. This prompted questions about potential insider trading, particularly as 'DJT' is also the stock symbol for Trump Media and Technology Group, which saw a substantial increase.

Doctors have refused to officially diagnose her with TSW, attributing her condition to extreme eczema.

            <p>The S&P 500 experienced its fifth-biggest two-day decline since 1950 following President Trump's announcement of a sweeping 10% global tariff and select reciprocal tariffs. The market decline is attributed to the uncertainty caused by the new tariff policy, which includes both output and input tariffs. Concerns have been raised about the potential for input tariffs to increase inflation during a period of slower economic growth. However, historical data suggests that the stock market tends to recover after such significant two-day declines. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Two couples from Orkney, Tommy Budge and Thelma Bruce, and Violet Budge and Leslie Flett, celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, marking a rare double platinum milestone. They were married in a joint ceremony in 1955 and attribute their long-lasting marriages to spending plenty of time apart due to work commitments. The couples received a card from King Charles and Queen Camilla, having previously received wishes from Queen Elizabeth on their 60th and 65th anniversaries. They shared memories of their wedding day and joked about the importance of independence and communication.</p>

            <p>Molly Harbron, a 26-year-old woman from Batley, West Yorkshire, has been awarded a multimillion-pound compensation deal after her leg was amputated due to hospital failings. Medics at Dewsbury Hospital failed to properly assess her case, leading to a delay in surgery. The Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust admitted that mistakes had caused the delay and that earlier surgery may have saved her leg. The compensation has enabled her to move to a bungalow and obtain a prosthetic leg, improving her independence.</p>
