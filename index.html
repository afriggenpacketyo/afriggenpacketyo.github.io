          <p>The chief executive of Co-op has issued an apology after confirming a cyber-attack in April resulted in the theft of data from all 6.5 million of its members. CEO Shirine Khoury-Haq stated that while no financial or transaction data was compromised, personal information such as names, addresses, and contact details were stolen. She expressed devastation over the incident's impact on both members and staff, who worked to contain the breach. The hack was part of a series of attacks that also targeted other major retailers like Marks and Spencer, leading to arrests by the National Crime Agency.</p>

          <p>Iranian authorities have seized a foreign-flagged tanker in the Gulf of Oman, accusing its crew of attempting to smuggle two million liters of fuel. The chief justice of Hormozgan province stated the vessel was intercepted because its cargo documentation was incomplete. Seventeen crew members, including the captain, have been taken into custody, though their nationalities and the vessel's details were not disclosed. This action is part of Iran's ongoing efforts to combat fuel smuggling, a persistent issue due to the country's heavily subsidized domestic fuel prices, which are among the lowest globally.</p>

          <p>Southern Water has announced a hosepipe ban for almost one million customers in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight due to prolonged dry weather. The restriction, effective Monday, prohibits using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens or washing cars. The company cited "critically low levels" in the River Test and Itchen, which are key water sources for the region. The move has drawn criticism from the GMB trade union, which highlighted the company's significant daily water loss from leaks while simultaneously raising customer bills.</p>

          <p>A debate is intensifying in Germany over the nation's staggered summer holiday schedule, with several states arguing the current system unfairly benefits Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. These two southern states always begin their school break last, allowing their residents to travel during less crowded and cheaper periods. Critics from other states, like North Rhine-Westphalia, are calling for an end to this perceived privilege, which is rooted in the 1964 Hamburg Agreement and linked to traditional Pentecost holidays. However, leaders in the south remain defiant, asserting that their holiday rhythm is a core part of their regional identity.</p>

          <p>Marla Maples, co-founder of the Global Wellness Forum, is advocating for a ban on weather modification technologies, citing concerns about public health and environmental safety. This comes as the EPA and members of Congress promise more transparency on the issue, which includes practices like cloud seeding and geoengineering. Florida recently became the first state to criminalize such activities, a move supported by figures like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. While some experts maintain that large-scale geoengineering is theoretical and not in use, the debate reflects growing public apprehension about atmospheric interventions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont has experienced a significant downturn in its Japanese market, with sales falling 15% in the first quarter. The company attributes the decline to a strengthening yen, which has reduced the spending power of international tourists, particularly those from China. This marks a sharp reversal from the previous year when a weaker yen fueled a 59% surge in revenues for the region. Despite the slump in Japan, the Cartier-owner's overall revenue grew by 6%, driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division, showcasing resilience amid a broader luxury market slowdown.

The recommendations follow a contentious debate over the roles and responsibilities of these positions, highlighted by cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors.

          <p>The Pentagon has announced it is ending the deployment for 2,000 of the 4,000 National Guard troops sent to Los Angeles to manage protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The deployment was controversial from the start, with California Governor Gavin Newsom suing to block the federalization of the state's troops. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass applauded the withdrawal, attributing it to the city's unified peaceful protests and legal challenges. Governor Newsom called for the remaining troops to be sent home, describing their deployment as political theater.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis highlights a severe and accelerating downturn in the UK's retail and hospitality sectors, moving beyond what was once called a "nation of shopkeepers." Numerous well-known brands like Hamleys, New Look, and River Island are closing stores or restructuring, following the path of now-defunct high street staples. The article attributes the crisis to a "perfect storm" of factors, including increased payroll taxes, higher minimum wages, and the long-term shift to online shopping. Experts note that this appears to be a structural, rather than cyclical, decline, fundamentally changing the landscape of British town centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes President Trump's recent shift in policy towards Ukraine, attributing it to financial persuasion rather than a strategic or moral awakening. The author argues that commitments from European NATO members to increase defense spending and fund military aid have convinced Trump that supporting Ukraine is no longer a financial drain on the U.S. While this has resulted in the supply of vital anti-missile systems to Kyiv, the author cautions that Trump's support is transactional and temporary. The analysis suggests that for now, the tangible value of NATO dollars has proven more influential to Trump than Vladimir Putin's rhetoric.</p>
