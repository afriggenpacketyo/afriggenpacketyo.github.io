            <p>A six-meter-tall Evangelion Unit 01 statue has been installed in Hamamatsu city hall as part of a local tourism initiative running through next February, aiming to capitalize on the city's ties to the popular anime film. The statue, representing the humanoid robot from "Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time," is displayed in the city hall lobby, drawing large crowds. This campaign follows previous Evangelion-themed initiatives by local railway companies, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the original TV series. The mayor hopes the campaign will encourage people to rediscover Hamamatsu's tourism and culture.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has hit a new low, fueled by widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. The survey indicates a shift towards economic pessimism among Americans, with a significant increase in the belief that the economy will worsen in the coming year. While Trump maintains support from his Republican base, he faces substantial disapproval from Democrats, independents, and even some segments of his traditional support base, such as blue-collar workers. The public expresses particular concern over Trump's handling of inflation and the potential for a recession.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, citing humanitarian considerations, but the announcement has been met with skepticism. Ukraine reports continued isolated attempts by Russian forces to advance, while Russia accuses Ukraine of violating the ceasefire. The move is viewed by some as a PR effort to improve relations with the Trump administration, which has grown impatient with the lack of progress on Ukraine. The brief truce was declared at short notice, leaving little time for either side to fully prepare.</p>

            <p>As the UK government grapples with the fallout from Donald Trump's trade policies, Heather Stewart argues that the Labour Party must focus on the broader risks to global financial stability, not just trade disruptions. While the government pursues deregulation of the City, Trump's actions threaten financial markets and could trigger a global crisis. Labour's current stance on financial regulation seems too relaxed, potentially overlooking the dangers posed by shadow banking and interconnected financial systems. Stewart emphasizes that a crisis in the hyper-globalized financial system would put everyone at risk.</p>
