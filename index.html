          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about shark conservation as the film "Jaws" nears its 50th anniversary. Pugh aims to change public perception of sharks, which he says the film wrongly portrayed as villains. He emphasized the importance of protecting sharks, stating that around 100 million are killed each year, an unsustainable rate. Despite the mental and physical challenges of swimming in frigid waters with the awareness of sharks, Pugh hopes his efforts will inspire drastic measures to protect these vital apex predators.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany, along with other Western allies, has removed range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine, enabling them to strike military positions within Russia. The Kremlin responded by calling the move "dangerous" and contradictory to aspirations for a peaceful settlement. This decision marks a shift from the previous government's reluctance to provide long-range Taurus missiles, fearing escalation with Russia. The new government emphasizes strategic ambiguity regarding weapon shipments to Ukraine, while Russia warns of direct participation by Berlin in the conflict if German-made missiles strike transport infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin claimed that Donald Trump was displaying "emotional overload" after he called Vladimir Putin "absolutely crazy" following Russia's intensified aerial attacks on Ukraine. Trump's remarks came after Russia launched a large-scale aerial assault, resulting in casualties and injuries across Ukraine. German Chancellor Merz stated that Ukraine's allies had removed range limits on supplied arms in response to these attacks. Peskov, Putin's spokesman, attributed the aerial assaults to Ukrainian attacks on Russia's "social infrastructure," while Zelensky condemned the attacks as a political choice to continue the war.</p>

          <p>An article by DW examines the sources of Israel's weapons supply amidst growing international calls for an arms embargo due to escalating violence in Gaza. Spain has requested European countries to suspend arms shipments to Israel, but the US, Germany, and Italy are the primary suppliers. The US is by far the largest arms supplier, followed by Germany, while Italy contributes a smaller percentage. While some EU nations have reduced or suspended arms exports, a significant embargo would require the involvement of the US and Germany, which appears unlikely given their long-standing support for Israel.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark will miss at least two weeks due to a left quadriceps strain, the team announced. Clark, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft, is averaging 19.0 points, 9.3 assists, and 6.0 rebounds through four starts in her second WNBA season. The injury will cause her to miss her first game after starting the first 44 games of her WNBA career, with a potential return on June 10 against Atlanta. It was not immediately clear when the 23-year-old sustained the quad injury.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg reviews Jesse Armstrong's new movie, "Mountainhead," a satire of tech oligarchs in Utah whose content tools unleash deepfakes, collapsing reality and causing global instability. The film draws inspiration from figures like Zuckerberg, Altman, Andreessen, and Thiel, portraying them as men who feel they own the future and are ready to break things. The characters fantasize about taking over failing nations and couping out the U.S. amid a planetary meltdown. Armstrong nails the futuristic jargon and philosophical approach of tech barons, finding it both amusing and scary.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are hopeful for a quick resolution to the trade war with the US after President Trump delayed threatened tariffs until July 9. The European Commission president persuaded Trump to extend the deadline, aiming to fast-track trade negotiations. The EU's "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table. Despite this progress, Trump's past flip-flopping on border taxes has created uncertainty for businesses. The EU is considering further retaliatory tariffs targeting US goods, including tech firms and banks, amidst ongoing trade imbalances.</p>

The measures, set to take effect June 1, outlaw food and drink sales, chair rentals, loudspeakers, and live music in kiosks without permits. While some welcome the move, others fear it threatens Rio's beach culture and the livelihoods of musicians and vendors.
