          <p>This year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival focused on youth and cultural preservation, showcasing a diverse group of international artisans. The event featured a Guatemalan Maya artist painting murals to keep her indigenous identity alive, and Bolivian rappers who blend Spanish with native languages like Quechua to connect with their heritage. Other participants included fourth-generation Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for stars like Dolly Parton and refugee weavers from Myanmar dedicated to revitalizing their ancient craft, all sharing their traditions with younger generations.</p>

          <p>China and Japan are engaged in a diplomatic dispute following a recent close encounter between their military aircraft over the East China Sea. Japan accused a Chinese fighter jet of making "unusual approaches" toward its surveillance plane, warning that such actions could lead to an accidental collision. In response, China's defense ministry claimed its forces acted lawfully and professionally, asserting that Japan's reconnaissance and harassment are the root cause of maritime and air security risks in the region.</p>

          <p>A child has died from measles at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, which is experiencing a significant increase in seriously unwell young patients with the virus. This is believed to be only the second such death in the UK in a decade, highlighting a concerning public health trend. Health officials attribute the surge to a decline in MMR vaccination uptake, with rates in Liverpool well below the 95% target recommended by the World Health Organization, and are strongly urging parents to vaccinate their children.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring further regulations to enhance online safety for children, signaling that current measures are just the beginning. A cabinet minister stated that the government will not "sit back and wait," with the Technology Secretary looking into actions to address issues like addictive online habits among young people. This comes as new rules under the Online Safety Act, requiring stricter age verification and content filtering by tech platforms, are set to be enforced by the regulator Ofcom later this month.</p>

          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, which killed a bystander, analysis reveals the incident was a catastrophic security failure for the U.S. Secret Service. Multiple investigations identified systemic issues, leading the agency to announce 37 reform measures to address lapses in intelligence, coordination, and communication. The article suggests these problems have deep roots, tracing back to the post-9/11 era when the agency's mission expanded significantly without a corresponding increase in resources, leading to persistent staffing and funding shortages.</p>

          <p>The assassination attempt on Donald Trump one year ago is now viewed as a pivotal moment that profoundly influenced the 2024 election and his current presidency. His survival and defiant reaction, raising a fist with a bloodied face, created a powerful image that galvanized his supporters and was framed as divine intervention. This event, which occurred just days before Joe Biden withdrew from the race, created a stark political contrast and is seen by many as a key factor in Trump's return to the White House and his subsequent governing style.</p>

By embedding small, low-cost microelectric controllers into live jellyfish, researchers can remotely guide their movements to collect environmental data on temperature and pressure from the deep sea. Since jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane and leverages the animals' natural ability to withstand extreme ocean depths, potentially revolutionizing access to underwater research for scientists globally.</p>

          <p>In a surprising adaptation to a difficult business climate, some of China's five-star luxury hotels are now selling low-cost street food to generate revenue. For instance, a top-ranked hotel in Changzhou has launched a service offering budget-friendly meal boxes with night market favorites, prepared by its own high-end chefs. This strategic pivot from expensive banquets to affordable takeaway meals underscores the economic pressures forcing even the most luxurious establishments to find creative ways to survive by appealing to a wider consumer base.</p>

          <p>On its 40th anniversary, the 1985 Live Aid concert is remembered as a groundbreaking global event that raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia, but its legacy is now viewed with more complexity. While celebrated for its unprecedented scale and humanitarian impact, the event is also criticized in retrospect for its lack of African performers and for promoting a "white savior" narrative. This modern re-evaluation highlights a continuing debate over whether Live Aid was a watershed moment of global unity or an event that reinforced patronizing stereotypes about Africa.</p>

          <p>A campaign in the UK is calling for cosmetic products to list ingredients in plain English rather than Latin to better protect consumers with allergies. Current regulations require companies to use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system, which uses Latin-based names that are often indecipherable to the public. Advocates, including a Member of Parliament with a severe nut allergy, argue this practice poses a serious risk and that cosmetic labeling should be as clear and accessible as food packaging.</p>

Adding to the unease, geopolitical friction is evident at the G20 finance ministers' meeting in South Africa, which the U.S. Treasury Secretary is skipping amid new tariffs targeting the host country.

Between 2020 and 2024, the number of kindergartens in China fell by over 13%, while the number of enrolled children dropped by more than 25%.

Although Turner argued she acted in self-defense, the audio, combined with footage from an in-home camera, was instrumental in the jury's decision to find her guilty of second-degree murder.</p>
