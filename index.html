        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a significant jump of 4% after the United States and China agreed to slash tariffs, signaling a potential rebound in economic growth between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. The agreement involves reducing tariff rates by 115% for 90 days as both nations continue trade negotiations, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This development comes after oil prices had previously plummeted to a four-year low due to global tariff regimes and increased OPEC+ supply.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has revealed its immigration plans, aiming for a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements by raising qualification standards to degree-level for most skilled workers, while simultaneously loosening visa eligibility for "high potential individuals" from select universities. The plan also doubles the residency period required for immigrants to apply for indefinite leave to remain, while scrapping care visas due to concerns about exploitation. Higher English language requirements will also be implemented for all work visas and adult dependents of visa-holders.</p>

          <p>The trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has commenced in New York City, with the hip-hop mogul facing accusations of running a criminal enterprise involving sexual assault and racketeering since at least 2004.

Ventura previously filed a lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of sexual assault and physical abuse, which was settled shortly after filing. The trial is expected to last eight to ten weeks.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily suspend most tariffs on each other's goods, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions. The agreement involves cutting "reciprocal" tariffs from 125% to 10%, while the U.S.' 20% duties on Chinese imports related to fentanyl will remain in place.

South Africa's foreign ministry has refuted these accusations, describing the resettlement scheme as politically motivated and an attempt to undermine the country's democracy. Tensions have also risen due to South Africa's stance against Israel at the International Court of Justice.</p>

          <p>As President Trump embarks on a Middle East tour, access to American-made artificial intelligence chips is expected to be a key point of negotiation with governments eager to invest in data centers. The Trump administration appears more willing than its predecessor to use AI chips as leverage to secure strategic bonds in the region, potentially playing into trade talks and other negotiations. Tech executives from companies like Nvidia and OpenAI are scheduled to travel to the Middle East, engaging with Saudi ministers and White House officials at an investment forum focused on AI partnerships. The US government began regulating AI chips systematically during the Biden administration, because of their value in helping governments develop military and surveillance technologies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal, while unlikely to pass in its current form, signals his administration's intent to overhaul the social safety net by cutting funds for education, housing, and health programs that benefit lower-income Americans. The proposal seeks to reduce funding for rental assistance programs and introduce a two-year limit on rental assistance for able-bodied adults. The budget also aims to eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps families cover heating and cooling bills. These cuts are intended to shift aid distribution, giving states more flexibility in spending but potentially reducing direct benefits to renters.</p>

          <p>Mitch Hutchcraft, a former Royal Marine, has successfully summited Mount Everest after completing an 8,000-mile triathlon that included swimming the English Channel, cycling across Europe and India, and running to Kathmandu. Hutchcraft's team claims it is the world's longest ever ascent of Everest from sea to summit. He undertook the challenge, named Project Limitless, to raise money and awareness for SAVSIM, a wildlife conservation organization, and to provide mental health support to veterans. Hutchcraft hopes his achievement will inspire others to pursue their dreams.</p>

The article also explores the pressures and real-world consequences of McPherson's actions, drawing comparisons to contemporary cases of misinformation and racial bias.</p>
