          <p>Kyiv endured a horrific night as a barrage of Russian drones and missiles struck multiple districts, claiming at least six lives, including a six-year-old child, and wounding over 50 people. The attacks caused extensive damage, destroying an entire entrance of a residential high-rise and impacting a children's hospital, schools, and kindergartens, with rescue efforts still searching for individuals under the debris. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strikes as "demonstrative murder," underscoring the necessity of strength for peace. These assaults continued despite recent threats from US President Donald Trump to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow if a ceasefire isn't reached, highlighting the relentless nature of the conflict and its severe human cost.</p>

          <p>A significant technical failure at NATS, the UK's air traffic control provider, led to widespread flight cancellations and severe disruptions across the country, affecting thousands of passengers. Although the issue was resolved within an hour by switching to a backup system, over 150 flights were cancelled on Wednesday, with disruptions expected to continue for days as airlines manage backlogs. Airlines are expressing extreme disappointment and demanding answers, with some executives calling for the NATS chief executive to resign, citing a similar major outage in August 2023. The Transport Secretary is scheduled to meet with NATS leadership to investigate the incident and implement preventative measures.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's China-bound H20 AI chips are facing heightened scrutiny from Beijing due to national security and data privacy concerns. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) summoned Nvidia, demanding explanations and supporting documentation regarding alleged "backdoors" and potential "tracking and positioning" technologies within the chips. This inquiry follows reports of serious security vulnerabilities and calls from US lawmakers for mandatory tracking features on advanced chip exports. The situation introduces another significant geopolitical challenge for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who must navigate Washington's semiconductor policies while serving the lucrative Chinese market.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a new trade agreement with Pakistan, under which Washington will assist in developing Pakistan's "massive Oil Reserves." Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Ishaq Dar, confirmed the deal, stating it would lead to lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the United States. This agreement comes shortly after Trump's recent imposition of a 25% tariff on India and his critical remarks regarding India's trade practices and relations with Russia. While specific details on tariff rates and oil reserves remain sparse, both nations are framing the deal as a significant step towards mutual economic benefit and strengthened ties.</p>

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned remarks made by Spain's Transport Minister, Oscar Puente, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers removed from a flight as "Israeli kids." French ministers Aurore Berge and Benjamin Haddad labeled the comment as unacceptable and discriminatory, also criticizing the "excessive and brutal use of force" by Spain's Guardia Civil against one of the trip's counselors. The incident, which occurred on July 23, involved 44 teenagers removed from a Vueling flight due to alleged safety risks and "inappropriate behavior," though conflicting accounts from other passengers exist. Paris insists no actions justified their disembarkation or the force used.</p>

Airlines are actively seeking to diversify their procurement options, prioritize faster delivery times, and explore more cost-effective alternatives. While no firm commitments have been made, the C919 is emerging as a compelling choice for the region's expanding aviation needs.</p>

          <p>Australia's government is moving forward with a world-first national social media ban for youth, pitching it as a solution to a growing mental health crisis among teenagers. The legislation, passed in November 2024, would impose substantial fines on platforms like TikTok and Instagram for failing to block underage users, though youth and parents would not be penalized. While the ban enjoys widespread public support, some experts question its effectiveness, arguing that there's insufficient research to establish a direct causal link between social media and mental health decline. Critics also warn it might push young people to less regulated online spaces and suggest focusing on broader mental health system reforms.</p>

          <p>UK high streets are grappling with a pervasive issue as organized crime gangs increasingly dominate retail spaces, primarily through the sale of illegal tobacco and vapes. In Newport, South Wales, 19 shops were shut down in nine months for illicit sales, revealing a broader problem that includes forced labor, illegal workers, and associated drug dealing. This illicit trade not only undermines legitimate retailers and fosters community fear but also deprives public services of nearly £72 million annually. Local authorities face an "endless battle" due to limited powers, as criminals often reopen nearby or use "stash cars" to continue their operations.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a "Full and Complete" trade deal with South Korea, setting a blanket 15% tariff on Seoul's exports to the United States, a reduction from the previously threatened 25%. Under the agreement, South Korea is expected to invest $350 billion in key US industries and purchase $100 billion in liquefied natural gas and other energy products. While Trump stated 90% of profits from the investment would go to Americans, South Korean officials interpret this as reinvestment, highlighting differing interpretations of the deal's terms. This agreement marks a shift from the longstanding free trade regime, though Seoul successfully resisted concessions on sensitive agricultural sectors like rice and beef. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top Texas Democrats are vehemently criticizing a proposed Republican plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, denouncing it as "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic." The draft map aims to transform five current Democratic-held US House districts into GOP-leaning seats, potentially expanding the Republican congressional majority. Democrats argue the proposal intentionally "scrambles" and fractures Black and Latino communities, thereby diluting minority representation for political gain. While Governor Greg Abbott cites "constitutional concerns" for the redraw, Democrats are preparing for an "all-out war," warning that this partisan gerrymandering could trigger similar actions in other states like California and New York.</p>

          <p>An Arapahoe County jury has delivered a guilty verdict against James Craig, a Colorado dentist, on charges of first-degree murder and five other counts in the poisoning death of his wife, Angela. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig intentionally administered a lethal cocktail of arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline in her protein shakes, even after she was hospitalized with worsening symptoms. The motive was primarily financial, centered on a struggling dental practice and $4 million in life insurance policies for which he was the sole beneficiary, alongside extramarital affairs. This premeditated and callous crime, driven by greed and deception, now carries an automatic life sentence without parole.</p>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for July registered a worse-than-expected contraction at 49.3, marking the fourth consecutive month below the 50-point expansion threshold.

Sub-indexes for employment and new orders also contracted, signaling a challenging economic environment.

Speaking at an event marking 50 years of China-EU relations, Shi argued that while Europe aims to "de-risk" from China, its existing dependence on the US remains substantial, and recent agreements further reinforce this imbalance. Beijing views the EU's de-risking policy as a thinly veiled attempt to contain China's economic and technological growth, highlighting a complex geopolitical dynamic.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company anticipates that President Donald Trump's tariffs will cost the company approximately $2 billion this year, a figure significantly higher than its previous projections. The automotive giant already incurred an additional $800 million in duties during the second quarter, primarily due to prolonged high tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, where Ford has substantial manufacturing operations. Furthermore, levies on imported aluminum and steel contribute to these increased costs. Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, confirmed that the company is in regular contact with the White House, actively seeking to secure lower tariffs, particularly on vehicle parts, to mitigate the financial impact.
