          <p>House Republicans are pushing for stricter work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a policy that could cause millions to lose coverage. The proposed legislation mandates that childless adults without disabilities prove they worked, volunteered, or attended school for 80 hours monthly to maintain eligibility. While Republicans argue this combats ‚Äúwaste, fraud, and abuse,‚Äù experts warn it could leave millions uninsured due to rigid paperwork standards. Arkansas's past implementation led to 18,000 people losing coverage without increasing employment, highlighting potential administrative burdens and coverage losses. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement would save $280 billion over six years by reducing Medicaid enrollment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue the manufacturing of pennies due to the rising cost of production, which now exceeds the coin's value. The penny, dating back to the early days of the U.S. Mint, costs approximately 3.7 cents to produce, resulting in an annual savings of $56 million by ending its production. Pennies are primarily made of zinc with a copper overlay, and the cost of zinc has more than doubled since 2000, contributing to the increased production expenses. The final order for penny blanks has been placed, with manufacturing expected to cease in early 2026.</p>

Republicans argue they are not changing Senate rules and accuse Democrats of supporting an electric vehicle mandate, while Democrats warn of potential future repeals of policies like Medicaid waivers. California's Attorney General has stated that this use of the Congressional Review Act is unlawful and the state is expected to challenge it in court. California has the unique ability to set more ambitious emissions rules than federal standards, which has been used to push the auto industry toward zero-emission vehicles.</p>

The deadlock means that the long-standing regime guaranteeing public schools remain secular institutions is still in effect, although the issue may return to the court in the future.

          <p>OpenAI announced plans to construct a large computing complex in the United Arab Emirates in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, SoftBank, and Emirati AI firm G42, following a deal between the Trump administration and the Persian Gulf nation. G42 will also contribute to OpenAI data centers in the United States, with investments matched dollar-for-dollar in both countries. The move is part of OpenAI's ambitious plan to build powerful AI systems, but it has sparked debate in Washington over national security concerns and the potential for the Middle East to become an AI rival. As part of the partnership, every citizen and resident in the Emirates will soon have free access to ChatGPT Plus.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, though it faces a complicated path through the Senate. Democrats vehemently oppose the bill's steep cuts to the social safety net, and Wall Street showed little enthusiasm, with major indexes falling amid concerns about exploding federal deficits. The bill includes a timeline for imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients and a fourfold increase in the cap on deductions that federal income tax filers can claim for state and local taxes. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would increase resources for households in the highest decile while decreasing resources for those in the lowest decile.
