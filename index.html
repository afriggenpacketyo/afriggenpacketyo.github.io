          <p>Meta Platforms' shares climbed significantly after the company announced robust second-quarter earnings, with revenue growing 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion, surpassing analyst estimates. The company also raised its third-quarter sales forecast to between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion, signaling continued growth. Increased capital expenditure estimates, primarily driven by substantial investments in artificial intelligence and hiring, reflect Meta's strategic priorities. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs unit, daily active people across Meta's family of apps grew to 3.48 billion, underscoring the strength of its core advertising business.

          <p>A Senate committee, with support from Republican Senator Josh Hawley and Democrats, voted 8-7 to advance legislation that would ban members of Congress and their spouses from buying, selling, or owning individual stocks. The bill, now called the Honest Act, requires lawmakers to sell existing stock holdings within 180 days and provide annual compliance certification. This bipartisan effort addresses concerns that current blind trusts are insufficient and aims to enhance ethical standards in public service. While former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced support, former President Trump initially expressed conceptual approval but later criticized Hawley, highlighting the complex political dynamics surrounding the issue.</p>

Hayes, 29, was apprehended shortly after fleeing the scene and has been charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated malicious wounding. Authorities believe the attack stemmed from a personal matter, not Vogler's political position, shocking the community.</p>

          <p>An Arapahoe County jury has found Colorado dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder and five other charges in the 2023 arsenic poisoning death of his wife, Angela. Prosecutors presented compelling evidence, including Craig's internet browsing history with searches like "How to make murder look like a heart attack?" and "Is there such thing as an undetectable poison?". The defense had suggested suicide, but the jury rejected this. The conviction carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, bringing a definitive legal outcome to this tragic case for Angela's large family.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported second-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations and reinstated its full-year guidance, which now includes an estimated net $2 billion hit from tariffs. The automaker had suspended its guidance in May due to President Trump's auto tariffs, originally predicting a $2.5 billion impact, now revised to $3 billion with $1 billion offset by mitigation efforts. Despite reporting a net loss of $36 million for the quarter due to "special charges" including a large vehicle recall, Ford's "Pro" commercial business saw an 11% revenue increase, indicating resilience amid economic challenges.

          <p>The United States has successfully repatriated an American child from al-Hol Camp in northeastern Syria, a vast facility housing tens of thousands of individuals with alleged ties to ISIS. The State Department emphasized that the child "has known nothing of life outside of the camps" and will be reunited with their family. This action supports the U.S. military's long-standing advocacy for countries to repatriate their citizens from these camps, which are notorious for poor living conditions and pervasive violence. The State Department views these repatriations as the only sustainable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in the region.</p>

Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, where he signaled concern about tariffs potentially causing "serious inflation," contributed to the rise in yields. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed 4.2 basis points to 4.37%, while the 2-year yield was up 6.6 basis points. These movements reflect market reactions to the Fed's cautious monetary policy stance and ongoing economic data, as policymakers continue to assess inflation and labor market conditions.

          <p>More than 30 years after four teenage girls were brutally murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, new DNA technology offers renewed hope for solving the infamous cold case. A partial male DNA profile was obtained from a victim, but advanced Y-STR testing revealed it did not match any of the four men previously arrested and later released. An initial promising match in a public database was also disproven by more detailed testing. Investigators, including Congressman Michael McCaul, remain committed to utilizing improving DNA science on the remaining limited sample to finally identify the perpetrator and bring closure to the victims' families.</p>
