          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing concerns over violence, antisemitism, and alleged coordination with the Chinese Communist Party on campus. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, requiring existing foreign students to transfer or lose their legal status. This move follows previous threats and actions against Harvard, including freezing federal grants, due to concerns about antisemitism and ideological alignment. The university has yet to comment on the decision, which could significantly impact its international student enrollment and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The couple, who were about to get engaged, were attacked by a suspect who shouted "Free Palestine" during the incident, leading to an investigation into a possible hate crime or act of terror. Lischinsky, a Christian and German-Israeli national, worked as a research assistant, while Milgrim, an American, worked in public diplomacy. Israeli officials have condemned the slayings as antisemitic and have called for increased security at embassies worldwide, while the FBI continues to investigate the motive behind the attack.</p>

          <p>Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict another above-average hurricane season for the Atlantic, expecting 13 to 19 storms between June 1 and November 30. Of these, 6 are expected to be full-blown hurricanes, with 3 to 5 being major hurricanes. Climate change contributes to the increased frequency and intensity of storms due to abnormally high sea surface temperatures. The absence of FEMA officials at the forecast announcement raises concerns about preparedness, as they usually share crucial safety tips. Residents are advised to review evacuation plans, assess flood risks, and secure flood insurance.</p>

          <p>A small Cessna Citation jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego early Thursday morning, resulting in the deaths of at least two people on board and injuries to eight others.

The initial removal included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". The Navy stated that nearly all of the originally pulled books are back in circulation, pending the Defense Department's formal review.</p>

The vote was 51-44, with Senator Elissa Slotkin joining Republicans in favor of the revocation. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, but Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California plans to sue the federal government if the waivers are revoked, as 16 other states and D.C. have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote, advancing President Donald Trump's tax and immigration agenda after weeks of internal GOP wrangling. The bill includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, fulfilling many of Trump's campaign promises. Trump celebrated the passage, calling it the "most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!" The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected, and faces staunch opposition from Democrats.</p>

          <p>The UK has signed a deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a key military base for £101m a year. Under the terms of the agreement Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a military base on Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years. The Conservatives described the deal as "an act of national self-harm", which left the UK "more exposed to China" because of its ties with Mauritius.  Some Chagossians are determined to return to live on the isolated islands, some are more focused on their rights and status in the UK, while others argue that the archipelago's status should not be resolved by outsiders.</p>
