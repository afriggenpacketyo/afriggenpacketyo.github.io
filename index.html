            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 12:53:18 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The US House of Representatives passed a Trump-backed budget bill that includes significant tax and spending cuts, facing opposition from both Democrats and some Republican hard-liners. The bill is a core component of Trump's legislative agenda, aiming for substantial tax cuts and increased government debt. The House and Senate versions of the bill, which differ in their spending cuts, must now be reconciled before being signed into law by the president. The bill's passage sets the stage for potential tax cuts but also raises concerns about the growing national debt.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The consumer price index indicated a slowdown in inflation for March 2025, primarily due to lower gasoline prices; the CPI rose 2.4% over the last 12 months. However, economists warn that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could reverse this trend, potentially driving inflation up to 4% by the end of the year. While housing inflation is expected to ease, rising grocery prices remain a concern, particularly egg prices, which have surged due to a bird flu outbreak. The Federal Reserve's long-term inflation target remains around 2%.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's decision to pause tariffs on trading partners led to a surge in freight orders as companies released shipments that were previously on hold. This pause has eased some market fears, but uncertainty persists within the supply chain due to the volatility of global trade policies. While some orders are being re-booked, tariffs on China remain in effect, creating a mixed outlook for importers and exporters. The situation highlights the sensitivity of global trade to political decisions and the challenges businesses face in navigating the changing landscape.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff plans triggered significant turmoil in the global bond market, particularly the US fixed income sector, leading to a surge in Treasury yields. This prompted Trump to delay additional tariffs, averting a potential financial crisis and leading to a stock market rally. Market analysts attribute the bond market's reaction to uncertainty surrounding the tariffs and a loss of confidence in the US economic regime. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen cited the selling pressure from highly leveraged hedge funds as a contributing factor to the instability.</p>

            <p>A Meta whistleblower, Sarah Wynn-Williams, testified before senators that Facebook collaborated with the Chinese government to censor its platform. She alleged that Meta provided custom-built censorship tools to the Chinese Communist Party and allowed potential access to American user data, undermining US national security. Wynn-Williams claimed that Meta executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, were indifferent to data security concerns and were personally invested in the company's business relationship with China. Meta has denied these allegations, calling them "divorced from reality and riddled with false claims."</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to overhaul the $1.6 trillion federal student loan system, potentially impacting repayment plans and loan forgiveness eligibility. Experts predict the SAVE plan, introduced by former President Biden, is unlikely to survive these reforms. Additionally, loan forgiveness under other income-driven repayment plans may be eliminated, and eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) could be narrowed. These changes could significantly affect millions of borrowers and the affordability of higher education.</p>

            <p>The U.S. dollar index experienced its largest drop since 2022, hitting a new low for the year, as President Trump's aggressive trade policy shakes investor confidence. Originally, Wall Street anticipated that the tariffs would boost the dollar, but instead, the U.S. currency has fallen significantly since Trump's inauguration and the unveiling of his trade policy. This decline coincides with sell-offs in U.S. stocks and bonds, potentially indicating that foreign investors are divesting from U.S. assets in response to protectionist measures. Rising concerns about a potential economic recession are also weighing on the dollar's value.</p>

            <h2>Trump Trade War Uncertainty Threatens US Oil Production</h2>

            <p>President Trump's trade war has injected significant uncertainty into the oil market, causing price volatility, eroding investor confidence, and jeopardizing domestic oil production. U.S. crude oil prices have fluctuated wildly, impacting the profitability of shale oil companies. While Trump's tariff pause offered a temporary reprieve, the increased tariffs on China and the broader trade uncertainty continue to weigh on the industry. This environment makes it difficult for companies to make investment decisions and could lead to reduced oil production.</p>

            <p>China is reducing the number of American films allowed in the country due to escalating tariffs. Officials claim the U.S.'s "abuse [of] tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favorability towards American films." China, the world's second-largest film market, has been crucial for Hollywood, but domestic tastes have shifted toward local movies. This move is part of the broader trade conflict, impacting cultural exchange and potentially hurting Hollywood's revenue.</p>

            <p>An economist analyzes Trump's tariff policies, noting that despite a brief pause, the US has erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, unseen since the 1930s. Tariffs with China are up to 125%, and there's a universal 10% tariff. This has caused a split between the hard data and the soft data. There are high risks with potentially high rewards, so it's best to have a low-interest savings account. It's important to avoid gaslighting to ensure positive communication.</p>

            <p>The House adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders convinced GOP holdouts to back it. The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans joining all Democrats to vote against it. House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts to "close your eyes and get there."</p>

Public health workers struggle to reach farmworkers who fear contact with strangers. Immigration raids and policies have created a chilling effect, making farmworkers less willing to seek medical care or testing. This poses a significant public health risk, as undetected infections could lead to the virus evolving and spreading more easily between humans.</p>
