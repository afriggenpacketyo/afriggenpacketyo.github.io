          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his opposition to a major tax and domestic policy bill backed by former President Trump, threatening to support primary challenges against any Republican legislators who vote for it. The billionaire, who once led a government efficiency department for Trump, has called the bill's spending levels "insane" and its debt increase shameful. This renewed criticism signals a potential re-engagement in politics for Musk, despite his earlier statements about scaling back political spending, and has drawn a sharp rebuke from Trump, who highlighted Tesla's reliance on federal subsidies.

          <p>The UK government is facing a substantial rebellion from its own Labour MPs over a contentious welfare reform bill, despite making last-minute concessions. Dozens of MPs are still planning to vote against the legislation, which aims to tighten eligibility for disability benefits like the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Critics, including disability charities, argue the changes are punitive and will push more people into poverty, while the government insists the reforms are necessary to control the rising costs of the welfare system. The Conservative opposition plans to vote against the measures, arguing they do not go far enough. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that French cinema has largely failed to confront the nation's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and its colonial past, leaving French audiences to learn about these histories primarily through American films. The article highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on anti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon as rare exceptions that offer powerful, nuanced portrayals of French oppression. Despite audience readiness and critical success, these films struggle for mainstream recognition, suggesting the French film industry remains hesitant to fully engage with these challenging but essential narratives.</p>

          <p>An employee of a nonprofit tutoring service was arrested at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey on suspicion of child endangerment and drug possession. The individual was allegedly found with approximately 170 pills, believed to be Xanax, following suspicious activity observed by probation officers. This arrest highlights ongoing concerns about drug smuggling into the county's juvenile facilities, following several youth overdoses earlier in the year and the overdose death of a teen in a different facility in 2023. The Probation Department has stated such behavior is unacceptable and a clear threat to safety.</p>

The sanctions, which bar Tolentino from entering China, Hong Kong, and Macau, were enacted in response to what the Chinese foreign ministry called "egregious conduct" and "malicious words and deeds" on China-related issues. Tolentino was instrumental in creating legislation that asserts Manila's claims in the disputed South China Sea, a law that Beijing has strongly opposed, further straining relations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>California has passed significant housing legislation aimed at speeding up construction by creating broad exemptions to the state's powerful environmental law, CEQA.

While developers have praised the move as a transformative step to cut through red tape, the legislation faced opposition from some labor unions and environmental groups, and its passage involved a "poison pill" tactic tying it to the state budget.</p>

It achieves this by inhibiting a specific enzyme associated with the body's inflammatory response. These findings help explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and could suggest new strategies for simulating its effects.</p>
