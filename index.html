          <p>The Israeli military has identified the body of Idan Shtivi, a 28-year-old hostage, recovered from Gaza. Shtivi was kidnapped from the Nova music festival during the October 7th attack and had been held for 693 days. This discovery follows the recent recovery of another hostage, Ilan Weiss, bringing the total number of remaining hostages to 48, with only 20 believed to be alive. The news has intensified fears among hostages' families, who are demanding a ceasefire deal to ensure the safe return of their loved ones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new dietary trend, clear protein, is gaining significant popularity among consumers seeking lighter, juice-like alternatives to traditional creamy protein shakes. Made from whey protein isolate, this form is often lower in fat, carbohydrates, and lactose, appealing to those with digestive sensitivities. While searches for the product are surging, dietitians note that it is not inherently healthier than standard whey concentrate, as both typically offer similar protein content per serving. Experts also caution that clear protein products may contain more artificial flavorings and sweeteners to compensate for the lack of fats and sugars.</p>

          <p>New evidence suggests that famed Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report revealed inconsistencies in Pusser's original account of an ambush, which he claimed was intended for him. Modern forensic analysis of the exhumed body and crime scene indicates the scene was staged, and a gunshot wound Pusser sustained was likely self-inflicted. Officials believe they now have enough evidence to have secured a murder indictment had Pusser, who died in 1974, been alive today.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America (VOA) and other government-funded international broadcasters, is set to eliminate over 500 employee positions. The announcement was made by acting CEO Kari Lake, following a federal judge's ruling that blocked her from firing VOA's director. This move is the latest development in a contentious effort by the Trump administration to reshape the agency, which critics argue undermines its mission to provide objective news globally. Employee groups have called the continued actions abhorrent and are challenging the legality of the plan.</p>

          <p>In her new album, "Man’s Best Friend," pop star Sabrina Carpenter satirically details her continued struggles with unsatisfactory romantic partners despite her recent career success. The album follows her hit record "Short n’ Sweet" and maintains a sound that blends '70s pop, country, and dance music, crafted with producer Jack Antonoff. The article describes the album as a sharp and witty critique of the modern dating scene, lampooning incompetent and emotionally unavailable men.

          <p>Recent Premier League matches have reignited fierce debate over the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system. Burnley manager Scott Parker criticized VAR after his team lost to a controversial late penalty against Manchester United, arguing that constant reviews are making football "sterile." Similarly, Fulham manager Marco Silva expressed frustration over a disallowed goal and a penalty decision in their loss to Chelsea. The article highlights a growing sentiment among managers, players, and pundits that the technology is being applied inconsistently and is detracting from the enjoyment of the game.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich and instructed him to return to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was made after fellow striker Liam Delap sustained a significant hamstring injury during a match, which could sideline him for six to eight weeks. The sudden reversal left Chelsea with only one fit senior striker, João Pedro, highlighting the club's precarious depth in that position.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs," which affect a wide range of imported goods, are illegal as he overstepped his authority.

The ruling, which the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, puts a significant portion of Trump's trade agenda in jeopardy, though sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum remain unaffected.

          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among child development experts suggests that limiting screen time is crucial for children, especially in their early years. Pediatricians and psychologists recommend a "screen-free until age three" approach to allow for essential sensory and motor skill development. For older children, the focus shifts from total time to the quality of content and supervised use, with recommendations scaling up from 30 minutes for preschoolers to about two hours for older teenagers. Experts emphasize that excessive screen time can displace vital activities like social interaction and imaginative play, potentially leading to poorer language and social skills.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay announced that he was recently diagnosed with Basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer. In a social media post, the 58-year-old chef shared a photo of his face bandaged after having a cancerous growth removed from near his ear. Basal cell carcinoma is typically caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Ramsay thanked his medical team for their prompt action and used the opportunity to remind his followers of the importance of using sunscreen to protect their skin.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has canceled his planned trip to Beijing as protests in his country continue to spread beyond the capital city of Jakarta. The demonstrations, which began over lawmakers' pay and were exacerbated by the death of a motorcyclist in a police-related incident, have seen regional parliament buildings set on fire. A presidential spokesperson stated that Prabowo wants to remain in Indonesia to monitor the situation directly. He was scheduled to attend a parade in China marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media. He was photographed on a family golf trip, which helped to quell the online speculation that had caused "Trump Is Dead" to trend on X. The concerns were partly fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance about being prepared to assume presidential duties in the event of a tragedy. The article also notes that previous concerns about Trump's health were addressed by the White House physician, who attributed bruising on his hand to frequent handshaking.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a direct bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is unlikely to happen soon. However, Trump suggested a trilateral meeting involving the U.S. "will happen" at some point, without providing a specific timeline. In the same interview, he also stated he would be open to the U.S. providing a security guarantee, potentially involving U.S. aircraft, to help end the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, a federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal for immigrants.</p>

          <p>Health officials in New York City have declared that the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the mayor's administration has proposed new measures to enhance the detection and prevention of future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers.</p>

          <p>Many vulnerable Afghans who fled the Taliban and were promised entry into Germany are now living in fear of deportation from Pakistan, where they have been waiting for visas. After a pause, Germany is resuming the admission process, but a Pakistani deadline for deportations is imminent. One family described their constant fear of police raids and being sent back to Afghanistan, where they would face persecution. Human rights organizations have been pressuring the German government to expedite the process, as German courts have affirmed that the commitments made to these individuals are legally binding.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three common heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. Researchers from Imperial College London found that the device, which analyzes heartbeat sounds undetectable by the human ear and records an ECG, significantly improved detection rates in a study involving over 200 GP surgeries. The technology sends data to the cloud for AI analysis, providing almost instant results. Experts believe this innovation could be a "real game-changer" for early diagnosis and treatment, with plans for a wider rollout across the UK.</p>

          <p>Macon Blair's remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger" stars Peter Dinklage as a janitor who transforms into a mutant antihero after being exposed to chemical waste. This updated version is described as a well-made and diverting homage that, unlike the Troma original, features appealing stars like Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood and a more polished production. While it retains the gratuitous gore and goofy parody of the original, its environmental message is more overt, with a villainous pharmaceutical company serving as the primary antagonist. The review suggests it's an enjoyable, if less transgressive, take on the source material.</p>
