          <p>A man is in federal custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office in what was initially described as a "targeted attack." The suspect, who had recently visited the office to make a complaint, reportedly exited the vehicle and threw an American flag over the gate before leaving on foot. No injuries were reported in the incident, and authorities have indicated the individual may have a history of mental health issues.</p>

          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral medication, orforglipron, demonstrated superior effectiveness in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss in Type 2 diabetes patients compared to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide, Rybelsus. The late-stage study showed Eli Lilly's drug achieved a more significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels and greater average weight loss after 52 weeks. However, experts note the comparison was against a lower dose of the Novo Nordisk drug, suggesting more data is needed to determine a clear winner in the competitive oral GLP-1 market.</p>

As classes resumed, a large memorial has grown at the site of the shooting, with many still processing the traumatic event. Students interviewed expressed fear about political violence and a loss of confidence in national unity, while others have found solace in prayer and a renewed determination to engage with Kirk's ideas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is reinstating a more difficult civics test for citizenship applicants, reverting to a 2020 version that was previously replaced by the Biden administration. Under the new rules, applicants must study from a pool of 128 questions and correctly answer 12 out of 20, a significant increase from the previous requirement of 6 out of 10 from a pool of 100. This policy change is part of a broader administration effort to tighten the legal immigration process, which also includes expanded vetting and background checks.</p>

          <p>The European Union has unveiled a new strategic agenda aimed at elevating its relationship with India, positioning the nation as a key partner and counterweight to China. This approach, which focuses on enhancing trade and defense-industrial cooperation, contrasts with recent U.S. actions that imposed heavy tariffs on India for purchasing Russian fuel. EU officials believe that fostering a stronger partnership is a more effective way to draw India away from Russia's sphere of influence, emphasizing shared interests in a rules-based global order.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to an issue with door trim pieces. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the trim on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving, creating a potential road hazard for other drivers. The company has not reported any accidents or injuries related to the defect, and dealers will inspect and replace the trim free of charge.</p>

          <p>An American mother living in Taipei has shared her positive experience with Taiwan's postpartum care system, which she found to be both affordable and comprehensive compared to her experience in the U.S. For approximately $5,000, she received a 10-day stay at a specialized care facility that included 24/7 support for her newborn, nutritionist-prepared meals, and wellness treatments. Her story highlights the cultural and systemic differences in postpartum support, with Taiwan's model focusing on communal care and the mother's recovery, which she believes every woman deserves.</p>

          <p>A state-mandated report has revealed that the Los Angeles Police Department fired more than 1,000 less-lethal projectiles, including bean bags and rubber rounds, at demonstrators during a single day of protests in June.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut this week, likely by a quarter percentage point, as policymakers weigh a softening labor market against persistent inflation concerns. The decision comes amid increasing political pressure from the Trump administration for more aggressive rate reductions. Beyond the immediate cut, financial markets will be closely watching the Fed's updated economic forecast and the "dot plot" of future rate projections to gauge the central bank's policy direction for the remainder of the year.
