          <p>An unnamed US official stated that the latest high-level discussions between Iran and the United States regarding Tehran's nuclear program concluded positively, indicating encouragement from the US negotiators. The talks, which aim to curb Iran's uranium enrichment activities in return for the easing of US sanctions, have reached an agreement to move forward with technical elements. The next round of negotiations, coordinated by Oman, will continue to address the differences between the two countries, with both sides acknowledging the difficulty yet usefulness of the discussions to better understand each other's positions and find realistic solutions. Despite red lines from both sides regarding uranium enrichment, diplomatic efforts are ongoing to avert future military action.</p>

          <p>Top trade officials from China and the US engaged in high-stakes negotiations over the weekend in Geneva, Switzerland, aiming to de-escalate a trade war marked by escalating tariffs. The talks, led by Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, represent the first high-level exchange between the two economic powers amidst ongoing trade disputes. Despite eight hours of closed-door discussions on Saturday and continued negotiations on Sunday, no official agreement has been announced, leaving the world awaiting potential resolutions to the trade tensions that have disrupted global supply chains and raised concerns about economic downturns.</p>

          <p>After a harrowing four-day clash, India and Pakistan have seemingly stepped back from the edge of conflict, though underlying tensions remain high. This New York Times article notes that the recent battles involved new military technologies, including weaponized drones, leading to a rapid escalation of airstrikes and antiaircraft volleys across the Line of Control in Kashmir and deep into both countries' territories. International diplomacy, particularly from the United States and Gulf states, played a crucial role in de-escalating the situation, which was triggered by a terror attack in Kashmir that killed 26 civilians. The article emphasizes that the political realities in both countries, marked by entrenched religious nationalism, create a persistent risk of future confrontations.</p>

          <p>In an interview, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby discussed recent radar outages at Newark International Airport and assured the public that flying in and out of Newark is safe due to backup procedures and pilot training. United has proactively reduced flights to accommodate airport capacity and ongoing runway construction, prioritizing customer safety and minimizing disruptions. Kirby acknowledged a decrease in demand due to safety concerns but noted that demand has stabilized, and larger airplanes are being used to maintain seat numbers. He emphasized the need to upgrade the air traffic control system and expressed optimism about the FAA's commitment to improving technology and staffing.</p>

The article details Ledbetter's discovery that she was paid significantly less than her male colleagues, leading to a Supreme Court case that she ultimately lost due to the statute of limitations. However, her efforts led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which President Obama signed in 2009, effectively ending the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims. Clarkson reflects on the importance of Ledbetter's journey and her own experiences with unequal pay in Hollywood, emphasizing the need for continued advocacy for equal treatment in the workplace.</p>

          <p>A group of Quakers are marching over 300 miles from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants. This march, rooted in a long tradition of Quaker activism for justice and peace, seeks to show solidarity with migrants and other targeted groups. The protestors aim to deliver a copy of the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document advocating for religious freedom, to the US Capitol.

Papal biographer Austen Ivereigh noted Prevost's unique combination of qualities as an evangelizer, statesman, and governor.

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from abroad, requiring firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas of existing overseas workers. This policy shift aims to reduce net migration by up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers over the next year. In addition to visa changes, the government plans to implement new training commitments to encourage unemployed individuals to re-enter the workforce, and will introduce a fair pay agreement for care workers to attract domestic talent. While the opposition supports ending overseas recruitment, they advocate for an annual migration cap exceeding the government's reduction target.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's selective promotion of “freedom of choice,” primarily in the economic realm as consumers, while simultaneously restricting options in the political sphere. The author argues that Trump and his administration are expanding consumer choices, or at least giving the impression they are, while limiting options in almost all other spheres, creating a new kind of authoritarianism. This is achieved through deregulation that favors business and promises more options for consumers, even as political, intellectual, and cultural choices are increasingly curtailed through executive orders and agency moves.</p>

Musk's unorthodox methods and criticisms of the president led to his decline, compounded by financial troubles at Tesla. While SpaceX and Starlink continue to benefit from government contracts, Musk's attempt to operate outside the established norms of government has proven unsuccessful.

          <p>Vladimir Putin's offer of direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul may be an attempt to drive a wedge between the US and European leaders, as the Kremlin seeks to improve relations with the Trump administration. While European leaders have demanded an unconditional ceasefire, Putin's counterproposal involves direct talks without an immediate ceasefire, potentially prolonging the conflict. This strategy aims to portray Putin as a man of peace to the US, while continuing military actions in Ukraine, thereby testing the strength of the Western coalition supporting Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the US and China are engaged in high-stakes negotiations in Geneva, aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump’s trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been rocked by tariffs imposed by both countries. Economists warn that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation, pressuring Trump to seek a deal. Despite initial positive comments from Trump, skepticism remains about the likelihood of a quick resolution, with analysts emphasizing the persistent challenges in US-China trade relations.</p>

While the media often portrays preppers as extreme, the behavior is deeply rooted in American history and self-sufficiency. The trend is driven by both apocalyptic anxieties and the response to inadequate government support during extreme weather events. The piece also delves into how the ultra-rich prepare, with a lot of the preparations being an exercise in conspicuous consumption.</p>

          <p>A cover story in The New York Times Magazine explores the influence of sibling relationships in shaping personalities and outcomes, noting that siblings often mold each other as much as parents do. Research suggests that this "sibling spillover effect" is more powerful in disadvantaged families, where siblings spend more time together. While birth order psychology is largely discredited, younger siblings may gravitate towards sports to find a domain of their own. The story also touches on how parental assessments of children can influence their academic paths and the role of genetics in shaping personalities and environments.</p>
