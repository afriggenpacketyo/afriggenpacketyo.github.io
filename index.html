          <p>Hundreds of rescuers are searching for survivors in central Texas after devastating flash floods resulted in at least 43 fatalities, including 15 children. The search is focused on areas along the Guadalupe River, where 27 children from a Christian youth camp remain missing after the river rose over 26 feet in under an hour. Governor Greg Abbott has signed an expanded disaster declaration, promising that search efforts will be relentless until every victim is located. With more rain forecasted, multiple flash flood warnings remain active for the region, highlighting the ongoing danger to residents and campers.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that the remains of all seven missing workers have been discovered following a major explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The Yolo County coroner's office is now working to identify the remains through autopsies and DNA testing. The incident occurred at Devastating Pyrotechnics' warehouse, which was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks, and the property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. Federal and state agencies are investigating the cause and plan to conduct controlled detonations of remaining hazardous materials at the site.</p>

          <h2>Expert Explains Geographic and Climatic Factors Behind Deadly Texas Flash Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 21:05:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the catastrophic flash flood that killed dozens in Texas Hill Country, a hydrology expert explains the region's unique vulnerability. Known as "Flash Flood Alley," the area's steep hills, shallow soil, and the Balcones Escarpment contribute to rapid water runoff, causing rivers like the Guadalupe to rise dangerously fast. The article notes that Texas leads the nation in flood-related deaths, and this event saw the river rise over 20 feet in less than two hours. Improving forecasting models and public education, especially for drivers, are cited as crucial steps to mitigate future disasters.</p>

          <p>Australian police have arrested and charged a 34-year-old man with reckless conduct endangering life following an arson attack on a synagogue in Melbourne. The incident occurred while worshippers were inside for a Shabbat meal, though all evacuated safely. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the act as "cowardly" and antisemitic, vowing the perpetrator would face the full force of the law. The attack is part of a rising wave of antisemitic incidents in Australia since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, prompting concern from both local and international leaders.</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted what it calls a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, indicating readiness for further negotiations. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that the changes Hamas is requesting are "unacceptable to Israel." Despite this, an Israeli negotiating team is set to travel to Doha to continue talks. The proposed 60-day deal involves the release of 10 living hostages and the remains of 15 others, with discussions on a permanent ceasefire to occur during this period.</p>

With his departure, effective July 20, the Republican majority will be reduced to 219-212, potentially creating more challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson's legislative agenda. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business aimed at helping America compete against China. His seat in the solidly Republican 7th District will remain vacant until a special election is held.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a new executive order aimed at curbing the dominance of Chinese firms in the global drone market, a move that could have significant implications for the industry. This is the latest attempt by Washington to challenge Beijing's leadership in the lucrative field. However, analysts and industry insiders note that China's well-established position makes it difficult for the U.S. to remove its products from supply chains. A U.S.-based drone company director views the order as a negotiation tactic but expressed concern that an actual ban would raise costs significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration is under fire for sending a widely circulated email that critics are calling misleading political propaganda. The email claimed President Trump's new spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." However, former officials and Democratic lawmakers point out the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher earners. Critics argue this communication from a traditionally apolitical agency is a blatant and unconscionable misrepresentation of the legislation's actual impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's rugby team delivered a clinical second-half performance to defeat Argentina 35-12 in their first Test match in La Plata. After a tight first half, England scored three quick tries, with Tom Roebuck touching down twice and Freddie Steward adding another. Fly-half George Ford, earning his 100th cap, masterfully controlled the game, adding crucial penalties to secure the win. Despite two tries from the Pumas, England's strong defense and composed attack proved too much for the hosts, setting a positive tone for the rest of the series.</p>

His last appearance had been in a pre-recorded video message. The conflict, which began on June 13, involved direct strikes between Israel and Iran and resulted in the deaths of top Iranian commanders and over 900 people in Iran.</p>

          <p>A new study focusing on women in Los Angeles has found a correlation between exposure to heat and wildfire smoke and negative birth outcomes. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that environmental factors, exacerbated by climate change, can have direct and detrimental effects on maternal and fetal health. The findings highlight the public health risks associated with increasing temperatures and more frequent, intense wildfires. Researchers and health officials are concerned about the long-term implications for children born in areas prone to these environmental hazards.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced on the social media platform X that he has formed a new political party called the "America Party." He stated the party's goal is to target a small number of key Senate and House seats to serve as a deciding vote on contentious legislation, thereby ensuring the "true will of the people" is served. The announcement follows a recent and public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump over a major spending bill. Musk, a major political donor, suggested the party would caucus independently and engage with both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" and will use humanitarian aid to encourage stability, inclusivity, and peace.

          <p>Newport Beach lifeguards performed 350 rescues on the Fourth of July as powerful rip currents created dangerous conditions for swimmers. One particularly large "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 people far from shore, requiring a significant rescue operation involving lifeboats and helicopter support. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for coastal areas across Southern California, which remain in effect through the weekend. The incidents serve as a stark reminder of ocean dangers as the holiday weekend draws large crowds to the beaches.</p>
