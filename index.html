          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among his over 100 children. Durov, who acknowledges being the "official father" to six children with three partners, has fathered over 100 children through sperm donations to a fertility clinic. He stipulated that his children would not have access to their inheritance for 30 years, wanting them to develop self-reliance and independence. Durov cited the risks associated with defending freedoms as the reason for writing his will now, as his work has earned him numerous enemies, including those within powerful states, making him aware of his mortality. The app, Telegram, is known for its focus on privacy and encrypted messaging, and has more than a billion monthly active users.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales experienced a sharp decline last month, primarily due to "dismal" sales figures from supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes are estimated to have fallen by 2.7% in May, marking the most significant monthly decrease since December 2023. The ONS also indicated a potential decrease in alcohol and tobacco sales as consumers opted to reduce spending. Separate figures from the ONS revealed an increase in government borrowing last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Associated Press has released its predictions for the top summer songs of 2025, covering various categories and musical tastes. Among the picks are Bad Bunny's "NUEVAYoL" for songs unexpectedly released in January, PinkPantheress's "Tonight" for those chronically online, and Lorde's "What Was That" as the summer's breakup anthem. Other selections include KATSEYE's "Gnarly" for girl-power anthems, Young Miko's "WASSUP" for singles ready to mingle, and Alex Warren's "Ordinary" for British-boy ballads performed by an American. Drake's "Nokia" is highlighted for those who lost the fight but still want to battle, while 803Fresh's "Boots on the Ground" is the TikTok-approved hit, Addison Rae's "Fame Is A Gun" is the song for trendy girls, and Sabrina Carpenter's "Manchild" is the revenge anthem, with Kendrick Lamar and SZA's "Luther" being the biggest song of the year and therefore the song of the summer by default, Morgan Wallen and Tate McRae's "What I Want" being the crossover country song of the summer, Charli xcx's "party 4 you" being the song of the summer released half a decade ago, and Leon Thomas's "Mutt" being the song of the summer with a dog-themed title. The article also references past summer hits in each category, offering a nostalgic look back at previous years.</p>

          <p>Tampa Bay Rays relief pitcher Hunter Bigge was hospitalized after being struck in the face by a 105 mph foul ball while in the dugout during a Major League Baseball game. The incident occurred when Baltimore Orioles' Adley Rutschman accidentally hit the ball into the home dugout at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida. Bigge, who was recovering from a muscle strain and not playing in the game, was immediately attended to by emergency medical staff, placed in a neck brace, and taken to the hospital for assessment. The game was temporarily halted for 10 minutes while Bigge received treatment, and he gave a thumbs-up to the crowd as he was being transported away.</p>

          <p>The China Coast Guard used a water cannon to expel a Philippine government vessel from the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. According to a Chinese spokesman, the Philippine vessel ignored repeated warnings and intruded into Chinese waters near the strategic shoal. China's Coast Guard implemented standard enforcement measures, including verbal warnings, close monitoring, and water cannons to drive away the unauthorized ship. China asserts that the Philippine actions violate its sovereignty and international law, while Manila has yet to comment on the incident.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump can continue to control National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The court stated that Trump's failure to issue the federalization order directly through the governor did not limit his authority to call up the National Guard. The ruling reversed a lower court decision that ordered Trump to return control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The court said the Trump administration had presented a defensible rationale for deploying the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property.</p>

The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, stated that recent rules are meant to limit extravagance, not ordinary dining. Some local governments have been scrutinizing every meal gathering and intervening in banquets, leading to agencies canceling official receptions and cadres avoiding normal working meals. These oversimplified measures have complicated understanding of the regulations and brought unnecessary shocks to the catering industry.</p>

          <p>Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system has been successfully intercepting drones and missiles, highlighting the need for strengthened missile defenses in the U.S. This performance has renewed interest in President Trump's proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system, a costly project aimed at protecting the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. Defense and space companies are vying for a slice of the project's pie, with Lockheed Martin and Boeing touting their credentials. The House Appropriations Committee unveiled a draft of its fiscal 2026 defense spending bill that features a $13 billion allocation for missile defense and space programs to support the Golden Dome effort.</p>

          <p>A mother from Bishop Auckland is among 28 people in the north-east of England who suffered potentially fatal botulism after receiving anti-wrinkle injections believed to be fake.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is investigating the illegal sale and supply of fake "Botox-type" products in the region. Experts warn that cheap injections may indicate the use of illegal toxins and call for regulation of the cosmetic injection industry.</p>

The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, extending the time before rot by almost a week or more. It was tested across 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes. The low-cost coating, costing about 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit, is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and potential toxicity.</p>
