          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, are advocating for stronger social media protections for children, emphasizing the need to prevent harm from online content. They unveiled the Lost Screen Memorial in New York City, a tribute to children whose families believe harmful online material contributed to their deaths. Prince Harry highlighted the challenges of keeping children off social media, as it can lead to bullying, and criticized tech firms for privacy arguments that prevent parents from accessing their deceased children's online activity. Meghan Markle stressed the global nature of the issue and praised parents who are speaking out to ensure children's safety online.</p>

          <p>The German government has revised its economic growth forecast to zero for 2025, primarily attributing the stagnation to the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. Outgoing Economy Minister Robert Habeck stated that the U.S. tariffs are disproportionately affecting Germany's export-oriented economy. While the government's forecast is more optimistic than the Bundesbank's, which anticipates a possible slight recession, there is hope that a new spending package could help revive the economy under the expected leadership of Friedrich Merz.</p>

          <p>The article discusses a Supreme Court case where the Trump administration attempted to deport immigrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act without due process. The author criticizes Justices Alito and Thomas for prioritizing procedural concerns over the imminent risk of harm to the individuals facing deportation. This "selective proceduralism" is seen as a way to allow the Trump administration's policies to become faits accomplis, undermining constitutional rights and facilitating authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Amid market uncertainty, experts are advising investors on how to balance cash and investments, noting that a traditional 60/40 portfolio typically outperforms cash in the long run. However, in times of turmoil, investors often prefer the safety of cash. The article suggests that retirees may want to keep one to two years' worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash, while also emphasizing that making radical shifts to your portfolio can often backfire, and it is important to stick to your long term investment goals.

          <p>A coalition of twelve states, primarily led by Democrats, has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging his authority to impose tariffs. The states argue that only Congress has the power to legislate tariffs and are seeking a court order to block the Trump administration from enforcing what they deem unlawful tariffs. The lawsuit contends that the President's trade policy relies on his personal whims rather than lawful authority, joining California's earlier legal challenge against the administration's trade policies.</p>
