          <p>President Trump asserted in an interview that he has made 200 tariff deals and spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though he did not provide specifics. He also addressed deportations, stating he was initially unhappy about the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia but later learned he was allegedly an MS-13 member. Regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump blamed Ukraine's NATO aspirations and expressed optimism about reaching a peace deal that would cede about 20% of Ukrainian territory to Russia. Trump also clarified that his promise to end the war on "Day 1" was an exaggeration.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials began preparing for a potential trade war well before the U.S. election, anticipating a hawkish China policy from a second Trump administration. Government departments and state-owned companies researched Trump's past actions and statements to develop strategies to counter potential fallout, including high tariffs on Chinese imports. These preparations included limiting business travel unless trade-related, reflecting the seriousness with which China views the potential economic challenges.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty despite his autism diagnosis. The defense argued that his autism reduced his culpability, but the judge stated that autism is not a disqualifier for the death penalty, though it could be a mitigating factor. The judge also ruled that jurors can hear much of the 911 call made by surviving roommates and see text messages sent around the time of the attack. The parents of one of the victims have stated that the details of the case warrant the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Former Democratic Senator Joe Manchin advises Democrats to work with President Trump rather than constantly attacking him. Manchin believes Democrats would be more effective by focusing on getting things done and suggests that many of Trump's actions are not as objectionable to average Americans as they are to Democratic officials in Washington. Manchin, who changed his designation to "Independent" after leaving the Senate, emphasizes the importance of due process and criticizes attacks on the judicial system, but he believes the electorate would better receive a more cooperative approach.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank (ECB) members discussed the near completion of the inflation job but also the tariff risks that loom over the European Union. Christine Lagarde noted the disinflationary process is on track but the impact of tariffs on inflation will depend on Europe's countermeasures. Klaas Knot highlighted that unpredictability in tariff actions creates a strong negative factor for growth, while Robert Holzmann emphasized the need to wait for more data before making monetary policy decisions. Mārtiņš Kazāks suggested tariffs present an opportunity for Europe to strengthen its economic and geopolitical position.</p>

          <p>Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) is highlighted as one of the best materials stocks to buy, with the materials sector influenced by economic cycles, supply chain challenges, and legislation. The demand for basic materials tends to drop when economic conditions deteriorate, which lowers prices and impacts the profitability of material producers. Despite persistent economic concerns in the United States and a noticeable slowdown in China, two important markets for industrial materials, the situation seems more favorable for growth in 2025. Persistent economic concerns in the United States and a noticeable slowdown in China, two important markets for industrial materials, burdened the sector in 2024. However, according to Fidelity, the situation seems more favorable for growth in 2025 as China implements economic stimulus measures and central banks in major economies currently lean toward monetary easing.
