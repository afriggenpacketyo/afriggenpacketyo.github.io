        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by faculty groups against the Trump administration over cuts to Columbia University's federal funding, which were implemented due to alleged tolerance of antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests. Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil ruled that the faculty unions lacked "standing" and failed to demonstrate how the administration broke the law. The judge appeared to accept the government's argument that Columbia enabled antisemitism and noted the university's absence from the case. The AAUP has vowed to continue fighting the Trump administration's policies, viewing them as part of an authoritarian agenda that threatens academic freedom and civil liberties. </p>

          <p>California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced an investigation into State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires, citing concerns over inconsistent claim management and inadequate record-keeping. The California Department of Insurance has initiated a formal Market Conduct Examination of State Farm, focusing particularly on smoke damage claims. State Farm stated that they are cooperating with the state and will comply with the investigation, asserting that many customers are satisfied with their assistance. Lara clarified that even if improper claim payouts are found, state law may not allow his office to prevent a previously approved 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers.</p>

          <p>Israel attacked Iranian state television and issued evacuation warnings to parts of Tehran after accusing Iran of deliberately targeting civilians with missile strikes, marking the fourth day of escalating conflict between the two nations. The attack on the Iranian state-run television network disrupted a live broadcast, with reports of casualties among reporters. In response to the strikes, Iran vowed further retaliation for Israel's attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure. The United States is increasing its military presence in the region to enhance its defensive posture, but President Trump stated that Iran "wants to make a deal."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Bar Association (ABA) is suing the Trump administration, arguing that its actions to punish law firms are unconstitutional, joining several targeted firms that have filed similar suits. The ABA's lawsuit challenges orders that cut off security clearances, contracts, and federal building access for law firms, often due to their pro bono work, associations with Trump's legal adversaries, or diversity initiatives. The ABA argues that these actions violate the First Amendment and have a chilling effect, intimidating firms from taking pro bono cases that oppose the administration's agenda. The White House has dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, asserting the president's discretion over government contracts and security clearances.</p>

The declaration of Juneteenth as a national holiday by the Biden administration had broad bipartisan support, and coincided with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. However, under President Trump, many diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have been banned or rolled back.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was "void and illegal," citing unlawful discrimination. Judge William Young stated that the cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), represented "racial discrimination and discrimination against America's LGBTQ community." The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration. The American Public Health Association and other health experts filed suit, arguing the cuts targeted research connected to race, gender identity, vaccines, or equity.</p>

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official, Dr. Fiona Havers, has resigned in protest over Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to alter vaccine recommendations and the committee responsible for them. Havers, who led the agency's network studying hospitalization trends from infectious diseases, stated that she no longer has confidence that data will be used objectively for vaccine policy decisions. Kennedy bypassed the usual ACIP process to narrow vaccine guidance and replaced the panel with individuals holding views aligned with his own, including some who oppose COVID-19 and other vaccines. The former ACIP members have criticized Kennedy's actions as dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.</p>

          <p>Senator Tim Kaine introduced a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to take military action against Iran without congressional approval, amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. The resolution would prohibit U.S. armed forces from engaging in direct action against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress or a declaration of war. Kaine expressed concern that the conflict could draw the United States into another endless war in the Middle East. The resolution, though facing challenges in the GOP-controlled Congress, aims to compel lawmakers to address the U.S. role in the conflict and presidential war powers.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Vance Boelter with six federal counts, including stalking, murder, and firearms offenses, for the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife. Boelter allegedly went to the homes of four Minnesota state lawmakers with the intent to kill them, carefully planning his attacks and researching his victims. One of the lawmakers, state senator Ann Rest, said that authorities told her Boelter had been parked near her house early Saturday morning. The details of the crime have been described as chilling, and the Justice Department is considering seeking the death penalty.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are proposing a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while conducting official business. The bill aims to increase transparency and public trust by requiring officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name or other identifier. Exemptions would be made for the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters. The proposal comes amid concerns about federal officers conducting raids while covering their faces and badges, raising questions about accountability.</p>

This directive contradicts a recent email from an ICE official instructing officers to pause worksite enforcement investigations in certain economic sectors.

Kennedy's decision to replace the panel with individuals who hold views aligned with his own, including some vaccine skeptics, has raised concerns about the future of U.S. immunization policy.
