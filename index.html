          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on 18 counts, including transmitting and retaining national defense information. The indictment alleges Bolton shared over a thousand pages of classified daily activities with two unauthorized relatives and stored classified documents at his home. This marks Bolton as the third high-profile Trump critic to face criminal charges recently, alongside former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. President Trump, unaware of the indictment, called Bolton "a bad person."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs will decrease dramatically due to new price negotiations, estimating a 73% per-cycle reduction for American consumers. Biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono has agreed to provide substantial discounts on fertility drugs like Gonal-f, which will be available directly to patients at an 84% discount. While this addresses a major component of IVF costs, which can exceed $25,000 per cycle, the overall procedure cost will not fall as sharply due to other associated fees. The administration also encourages employers to offer supplemental fertility insurance, falling short of Trump's previous pledge for full coverage.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted Cameron Arnold and Zachary Evetts, accusing them of orchestrating a violent July 4 attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Alvarado, Texas. The Department of Justice alleges the men were part of an "Antifa cell" that planned to target law enforcement with gunfire and explosives, resulting in an officer being shot in the neck. The indictment claims extensive preplanning, firearm training, and coordination via encrypted messaging, while defense attorneys argue anti-government beliefs are not crimes.

          <p>Authorities in Harvard, Illinois, have released preliminary findings on the deaths of Rachel Dumovich, 29, and Brandon Dumovich, 30, a newlywed couple found in their car days before their first anniversary. Both died from gunshot wounds to the head, and a gun was found inside the vehicle. While a murder-suicide is a potential scenario, the investigation is ongoing, and no final determination has been made. The couple, described as "middle school sweethearts" on a wedding page, were from Sharon, Wisconsin, and were discovered by an officer on October 6.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced plans to advance a bipartisan bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, stating the "time has come" for a vote within the next 30 days. This move follows President Trump's call with Vladimir Putin, where they discussed a future meeting in Budapest to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Despite Trump's earlier reservations about timing, Thune believes the Senate should proceed, addressing White House concerns about implementation. The proposed legislation, backed by 84 senators, includes a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian oil and gas, with a presidential waiver option for national security.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld its block on President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, though it allowed them to remain under federal control. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration failed to justify the federalization of troops under Title 10, which requires evidence of a "rebellion or danger of a rebellion" or inability to execute laws with regular forces. Judges found "insufficient evidence" that protests against immigration policies constituted a rebellion or significantly hampered federal officers.

Despite Apple's promotional claims of a "transformational, hands-free" experience, the beta feature required constant phone proximity and manual interaction, proving cumbersome.

The project is part of Trump's broader vision for the capital, which includes White House renovations and clearing homeless encampments.

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its new $100,000 fee for H-1B worker visas, deeming it unlawful. The Chamber argues the fee, a significant increase from previous costs, will make it prohibitively expensive for American employers, particularly startups and small businesses, to access global talent. They contend the fee overrides the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires fees to be based on government processing costs. This article highlights a legal challenge to immigration policy, impacting the technology sector and broader economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers near Venezuela's coast, approximately 150 miles north, as the Trump administration intensifies pressure on Nicolás Maduro's government.

          <p>The US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has suspended its operations in Gaza following the October 10 ceasefire, despite having funding until November. The GHF, which faced criticism after hundreds of Palestinians died near its distribution sites, stated its northernmost site was shut down as it was no longer in IDF-controlled territory. While the GHF aims to resume aid, speculation exists that the ceasefire terms might exclude them. UN data shows little change in aid collection post-ceasefire, with a significant portion intercepted, underscoring persistent challenges in humanitarian delivery and security.</p>
