          <p>New York City experienced a significant outflow of high-earning residents between 2017 and 2022, resulting in a loss of billions in income, with many fleeing to Florida and nearby states due to the pandemic, affordability concerns, and quality of life issues. However, the city's population has recently grown by 120,000 residents, driven by an influx of migrants. A report by the Citizens Budget Commission emphasizes the importance of New York City's competitiveness in attracting and retaining residents and businesses. Despite positive views on parks and cultural offerings, many New Yorkers feel quality of life and public safety have declined. Optimism score is 55.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is bracing for President Trumpâ€™s tariffs to potentially hinder economic growth while simultaneously fueling inflation, which may delay interest rate cuts. Despite a solid labor market, the Fed is wary of the uncertainty caused by Trump's trade policies, as businesses are already shelving investments and raising prices. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that tariffs could both dent growth and stoke inflation, putting the central bank in a difficult position. The latest jobs report showed better-than-expected payroll growth and a steady unemployment rate, but officials are debating whether the anticipated surge in consumer prices will be temporary or lead to persistently higher inflation. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to significantly impact holiday sales promotions, potentially leading to leaner inventories and fewer discounts for consumers.

          <p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reports that global press freedoms are at an "all-time low" in 2025, particularly noting a deterioration under US President Donald Trump. The organization's main index has fallen to its lowest level in 23 years, with over half the world's population living in countries with a "very serious" situation. RSF noted that the situation in the US has worsened under Trump, who has allegedly weaponized institutions, cut support for independent media, and sidelined reporters. Europe remains the safest place for journalists, but Germany has fallen out of the top ten in the ranking. Optimism score is 25.</p>
