The baby girl was discovered wrapped in a blanket on a train platform at Penn Station during the Monday morning rush hour. Authorities reported that the infant was transported to a hospital and is in stable condition, an outcome one official described as a "miracle."

          <p>The Argentine peso has fallen to record lows against the U.S. dollar, continuing its decline despite a significant financial support package from the United States. The intervention, which includes U.S. Treasury purchases and a $20 billion currency swap, was intended to stabilize the currency ahead of the country's midterm elections. However, political uncertainty and market expectations of a potential return to inflationary Peronist policies have overshadowed the support efforts. Analysts suggest that while the U.S. intervention may have prevented a worse decline, it is insufficient to fully counteract the market stress driven by electoral concerns.

          <p>Gold prices and related mining stocks have decreased for a second consecutive day, with the precious metal now down approximately 8% from its recent record high. The selloff is being attributed to technical factors and profit-taking by speculative investors rather than any specific macroeconomic or geopolitical event. Despite the pullback, gold remains up over 50% for the year. Analysts from UBS suggest that the fundamental drivers for gold's rally, including inflation and political instability, persist, making it premature to adopt a negative outlook on the metal.

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has formally requested that the Trump administration halt the demolition of the White House East Wing. The construction is part of a plan to build a large, privately funded ballroom, but the group expresses concern that the proposed addition will overwhelm the historic structure. This call follows similar objections from the Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects regarding the project's scale. The White House has dismissed the concerns, attributing them to political opposition while defending the project as a visionary addition.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has issued a warning about potential, temporary production stoppages resulting from China's export restrictions on semiconductors from the Dutch firm Nexperia. While Nexperia is not a direct supplier, its chips are used in components that Volkswagen sources from other partners. The disruption stems from the Dutch government seizing control of the Chinese-owned company, prompting a retaliatory export block from Beijing. This situation highlights the vulnerability of the European auto industry's supply chain to geopolitical tensions, with Germany's main auto lobby also expressing concern over significant production restrictions.</p>

In contrast, applications for home purchases fell by 5% for the week, suggesting potential buyers may be waiting for even lower rates.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the government, accusing it of a "cover-up," while Starmer insisted the inquiry would proceed with survivors at its heart.

However, this article posits that the final scene clarifies the movie's true focus is not on #MeToo but on performance and the cynical ways characters position themselves for moral validation.

          <p>The family of Alejandro Carranza, one of at least 32 people killed in recent U.S. military strikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean, insists he was an innocent fisherman. His wife denies he had any connection to the drug trade and questions why he was killed instead of being detained. The Trump administration has justified the strikes as part of a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels. The incident has created a diplomatic dispute, with Colombia's president condemning the attack as an "assassination" and a violation of sovereignty, while the White House stands by its actions.</p>

          <p>Anthony Boyd, a 53-year-old Alabama death row inmate, has requested a meeting with Governor Kay Ivey just hours before his scheduled execution by nitrogen gas. Boyd, who was convicted for the 1993 murder of Gregory Huguley, has consistently maintained his innocence and asked the governor to speak with him "before an innocent man is executed." A spokesperson for the governor stated that while she reviews every case, her process does not include one-on-one meetings with inmates, calling the request unworkable. Boyd's execution is set to proceed using nitrogen hypoxia, a controversial method first used by the state last year.</p>

          <p>The Russian government appeared to be in damage-control mode after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was putting a planned summit with Vladimir Putin on hold. Trump stated he did not want a "wasted meeting" after Russia's foreign minister reiterated that Moscow was not interested in an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. In response, a Kremlin spokesperson insisted that preparations for the meeting were still underway, though dates had not been finalized, downplaying the apparent suspension. The development marks a significant reversal after Moscow had appeared confident following an initial phone call between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reclassified federal firearms examiners as "essential" workers, ordering them back to work amidst the ongoing government shutdown. This decision allows for the resumption of sales of highly regulated weapons, such as silencers and short-barreled rifles, which had been halted. The move follows intense lobbying from the gun industry and Republican politicians, who argued the pause on these sales was a violation of Second Amendment rights. Critics point out that while services like new drug approvals remain suspended, the administration has prioritized processing applications for firearms that pose a significant public safety risk.</p>

The analysis found that jackets and outerwear experienced the steepest hike, with prices climbing by 24% between 2024 and 2025. This trend could pose challenges for retailers, as higher prices combined with a late start to the fall season may weaken consumer demand for winter clothing. In contrast, swimwear saw the smallest price increase at just 2%, highlighting varying inflationary pressures within different segments of the apparel market.</p>

          <p>Florida's high-speed Brightline train, which runs between Miami and Orlando, has been involved in at least 185 fatalities since it began service in late 2017, earning it the nickname "Death Train." While the company states that no deaths have been caused by operator error and are instead the result of reckless behavior, its accident rate is significantly higher than other U.S. rail lines. The article suggests the high number of "at-grade" crossings, where the train intersects with roads, is a major factor. The train line runs through densely populated urban areas on a historic route where faster, more frequent passenger service is a recent development.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the current cultural fixation on adding protein to everything from coffee to snacks is driven by marketing rather than nutritional science. The article points out that most Americans already consume more than enough protein, and these fortified, often ultra-processed products can lead to excess calorie intake. The author, a researcher at Columbia University, explains that protein needs vary significantly throughout life, with different requirements for children, adults, and the elderly. This piece suggests the trend mirrors past food fads like "fat-free," ultimately promoting a simplistic and potentially unhealthy approach to nutrition.</p>

This historical parallel suggests Beijing is preparing for a period of increased self-reliance and state-led economic planning.
