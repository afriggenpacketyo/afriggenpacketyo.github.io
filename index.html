          <p>Recent data from the Office for National Statistics indicates a slowdown in the UK's job market, with vacancies falling by 5.8% between May and July. The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest drop, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors. Despite the cooling, economists note the slowdown is gradual, as the unemployment rate held steady at 4.7% and wage growth remained at 5%. This trend may influence the Bank of England's future decisions on interest rates as it aims to manage inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As a U.S.-Russia summit approaches, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a stark warning that Moscow is not to be trusted and is preparing new military offensives. Zelenskyy stated that intelligence indicates Russian President Vladimir Putin is not planning for a ceasefire but rather aims to use the meeting for a personal victory before continuing pressure on Ukraine. European officials, who are not invited to the talks, have echoed these concerns, with the EU's foreign policy chief asserting that Putin is merely pretending to negotiate to postpone further sanctions.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Gaza City resulted in the deaths of six Palestinian journalists, including five from Al Jazeera. Among the deceased was Anas al-Sharif, a well-known correspondent whom Israel's military accused of being a Hamas commander, an allegation journalist groups call unsubstantiated. The attack has drawn widespread condemnation, with organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists accusing Israel of a pattern of targeting messengers. Al Jazeera described the killing as a desperate attempt to silence reporting on the impending Israeli seizure of Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, a summit raising concerns in Kyiv and Europe. Ukraine is not included in the talks, prompting fears that a deal involving territorial concessions could be made without its consent. Trump has described the meeting as a preliminary discussion to assess Russia's terms, suggesting land swaps could be part of a deal. Analysts are skeptical that the summit will produce a comprehensive solution, viewing it more as an attempt to gauge potential compromises.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is actively exploring a potential transfer for Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze. The move is intended to strengthen their attacking options, especially after midfielder James Maddison was sidelined with a long-term knee injury. Eze, who scored 14 goals for Palace last season and was part of England's Euro 2024 squad, has emerged as a significant target for Spurs. The club is also in discussions for Manchester City's Savinho, but it remains unconfirmed if they will pursue deals for both players.</p>

          <p>A severe frost in Turkey, the world's largest hazelnut producer, has significantly damaged the 2025 crop, causing prices to jump over 35%. This shortage poses a major challenge for the confectionery industry, particularly for brands like Ferrero, which uses about a quarter of the global hazelnut supply for products like Nutella. The disruption could lead to higher prices for consumers, recipe reformulations, or smaller product sizes. While Turkey's leftover stock from 2022 has provided some buffer, the event highlights the vulnerability of agricultural supply chains to climate change. (not investment advice)</p>

While he expressed some regret over not playing in the Premier League, he remains happy with his career path, which includes a Champions League title with Bayern Munich. Now 37, Lewandowski credits former Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp as a father-like figure who had a profound impact on his life and career. He also discussed his close call with the Ballon d'Or in 2020 and 2021.</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows Most Israelis Want Hostage Deal but Feel Little Sympathy for Palestinian Suffering</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a growing majority of Israelis support a deal with Hamas to release all hostages, recent surveys indicate a stark disconnect regarding the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. A poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 79% of Jewish Israelis were not troubled by reports of famine and suffering in Gaza. This sentiment contrasts with growing domestic protests against the government's war strategy, driven primarily by the families of hostages who fear for their loved ones' safety. Analysts suggest that years of conflict and existential anxiety have hardened attitudes within Israeli society.</p>

          <p>Thousands of North Koreans are being sent to Russia to fill labor shortages, where they face what is described as slave-like conditions, according to a BBC investigation. Workers who have escaped describe grueling 18-hour workdays on construction sites, confinement, and abuse from supervisors, with their earnings largely confiscated by the North Korean state. South Korean intelligence suggests over 10,000 laborers were sent last year in violation of UN sanctions, with many more expected. The influx is seen as a way for Russia to address its labor deficit while providing cash for Kim Jong Un's regime.</p>

          <p>Spain is creating friction with the Trump administration by pursuing an independent foreign policy, notably by renouncing U.S. aircraft purchases and resisting NATO's 5% defense spending target. The Spanish government has opted for European military aircraft and is seeking closer economic ties with China, awarding a contract to Huawei despite U.S. pressure. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using foreign policy to distract from domestic issues. While President Trump has threatened trade repercussions, Spain has so far been shielded by the EU's collective trade agreements.</p>

          <p>A specific knee-replacement implant used in thousands of UK operations had a known high failure rate for eight years before it was finally withdrawn, a BBC investigation found. The NexGen implant, manufactured by Zimmer Biomet, has left numerous patients in severe pain or addicted to painkillers after the component slipped out of place, requiring corrective surgery. Surgeons and the National Joint Registry had flagged concerns as early as 2014, but the product was not recalled from the UK market until 2022. The total cost to the NHS for corrective surgeries is estimated to be in the millions of pounds.</p>

          <p>During a trial over Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration, a top general involved in the 2024 National Guard deployment in Los Angeles testified he never heard the term "rebellion" used to describe the protests.

The lawsuit questions whether the use of military forces violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from domestic law enforcement. The trial is examining the legality and justification for deploying nearly 5,000 service members in response to protests against ICE operations.</p>

The assassination has alarmed a nation that has not seen such high-level political violence since the 1990s, and it prompted the government to increase security for all presidential hopefuls.</p>

Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto had one of his worst starts, giving up six runs in under five innings, including a first-pitch home run. The loss continues a difficult stretch for the Dodgers, who have a 12-19 record since early July.

Ukraine is increasingly relying on these low-cost, high-speed FPV drones to counter Russian drone waves that aim to overwhelm its air defenses. While still deployed at a limited scale, Ukraine hopes to ramp up production to bolster its defense capabilities against these persistent aerial threats.</p>
