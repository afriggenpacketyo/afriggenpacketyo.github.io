          <h2>Cognac Producers in France Adapt to Climate Change and Trade Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing multiple challenges, including climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Climate change is causing grapes to ripen earlier and become sweeter, affecting the acidity needed for good cognac, while tariffs from the U.S. and China are impacting exports, with exports to China decreasing by half. Despite these challenges, many family-run businesses are adapting by diversifying into new markets and experimenting with organic cognac, cocktails, and aperitifs, while remaining optimistic about the future of cognac due to interest from younger generations in quality spirits. The industry is also focusing on sustainable practices to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, a day before President Trump was expected to speak with President Putin regarding a cease-fire. The attack, which involved an estimated 273 drones, resulted in casualties and injuries. Despite the ongoing assaults, President Zelensky reiterated his readiness for a cease-fire after meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Rubio in Rome, with the Vatican offering to host peace talks. Former American ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A. Brink, resigned due to the Trump administration's approach to the war, which she felt pressured Ukraine rather than Russia.</p>

          <p>A California family is suing Harrison-Ross Mortuary in Compton after discovering the wrong man dressed in their uncle's suit inside the casket during preparations for the burial service. Amentha Hunt, the niece of the deceased, noticed the discrepancy and alerted a mortuary worker, who initially dismissed her concerns. The family endured a three-hour delay while the mortuary rectified the mix-up, and Hunt reports ongoing trauma from viewing the incorrect body. The funeral home denies the allegations and plans to file a cease-and-desist letter against Hunt, but the family's attorney emphasizes the need for improved standards of care to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, expressed shock and disbelief, stating his son had changed after a period in Twentynine Palms. Bartkus, who is believed to have died in the explosion, allegedly held anti-natalist beliefs and packed his car with explosives before driving to the clinic. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism and seeking public assistance to identify Bartkus' movements before the explosion. The father recalls his son's childhood fascination with how things worked, including making harmless smoke bombs, but never imagined he would commit such a destructive act.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are employing a novel method to track endangered water voles by feeding them edible glitter. With water vole populations declining by 90% in the past 30 years, Nature Conservation Cymru hopes the glitter will appear in the animals' droppings, allowing them to monitor their movements and habitat use. The team consulted with vets to ensure the glitter is safe for the voles and plans to use different colors to track various families. By understanding the voles' territory and range, conservationists can implement measures to protect their environment and aid their dispersal.</p>

          <p>A researcher at Princeton University argues that President Trump's policies are undermining American power and innovation, allowing China to surpass the U.S. in key industries. While Trump focuses on tariffs and trade wars, China is investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. China already leads in industries such as steel, electric vehicles, and 5G equipment, and is projected to dominate high-end manufacturing in the future. The author contends that the U.S. needs to invest in research, innovation, and global economic ties to avoid becoming a diminished nation.</p>

          <p>The United States' loss of its last triple-A credit rating by Moody's, coupled with rising concerns about government debt, is posing a threat to the financial markets. The downgrade was influenced by a bill in Congress aimed at making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. The downgrade could send ripple effects through financial markets if it begins to shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, which would likely spur global investors to demand higher premiums in return for buying U.S. debt. Some analysts believe the credit downgrade exacerbates existing concerns about Mr. Trumpâ€™s tariff agenda and its impact on the American economy.</p>

          <p>A corruption investigation involving staff and ex-staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has emerged, raising concerns about oversight in the defense sector, which is known for its secrecy and large sums of money. The investigation involves possible irregularities in contracts awarded to buy ammunition and drones, with indications that money was laundered through consultancy companies. As NATO countries increase defense spending in response to Russia's military buildup, experts emphasize the importance of transparency and oversight to prevent corruption and ensure that public money is spent effectively.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee revived President Trump's stalled bill to cut taxes and spending, after a handful of fiscally conservative Republicans relented and allowed it to advance even as they continued to press for deeper reductions to health and environmental programs. The vote signaled a temporary resolution to a remarkable revolt from a group of hard-liners on the panel, who on Friday joined Democrats in opposing the bill in committee, tanking it over concerns that it did not do enough to rein in the nationâ€™s ballooning debt. In a lengthy statement on social media minutes after the vote, Mr. Roy said he and the three other conservatives had secured commitments for changes to the bill that include speeding implementation of new work requirements for Medicaid and further curtailing clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

The AfD has been classified as a "confirmed right-wing-extremist" party, leading to debates about its potential ban. In contrast, parties like the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÃ–) have formed coalition governments, and Giorgia Meloni leads the Brothers of Italy party as one of Europe's most successful far-right heads of state. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, is also gaining traction in the UK, focusing on reducing immigration.</p>

          <p>The global market for diabetes drugs used for treating obesity is expected to expand in Asia, with new players jostling with giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for a share of the multibillion-dollar industry, with China providing a big opportunity for growth, analysts said. The market for weight-loss drugs could see new entrants among existing biotech firms, with several drug candidates likely to be approved for commercial sales in the next five years, according to Francis Chow Chun-chung, founding president of Hong Kong Association for the Study of Obesity.

The CuauhtÃ©moc's masts struck the bridge as the ship departed the South Street Seaport, with the captain reportedly losing control due to a technical failure. Senator Schumer questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have played a role in the incident, while the Coast Guard stated that its vehicle traffic service (VTS) was fully functional during the incident.

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared another hurdle in the House late Sunday after conservatives rebelled Friday over concerns the legislation does not contain steep enough spending cuts. The opposition stalled the bill while negotiations with Republican leadership carried through the weekend to try to get conservatives on board, culminating with the House Budget Committee scheduling a second vote late Sunday to move it one step closer to a floor vote before the lower chamber's self-imposed Memorial Day deadline. Four conservative holdouts â€” Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia â€” this time voted present instead of against the legislation, allowing it to advance in a vote where 17 members were in favor and 16 were opposed.</p>

Both sides face domestic pressure to defend their interests, with the insurgent Reform U.K. party taking aim at the proposed youth mobility plan.</p>

          <p>Russian forces have been increasing their military presence near the Finnish border, a new NATO member, according to satellite imagery. The imagery reveals new tents, warehouses, and renovations to fighter jet shelters, suggesting a longer-term expansion. While NATO officials say this is not comparable to the buildup before the Ukraine invasion, Finnish defense officials anticipate Russia will redeploy thousands of troops to the border if the war in Ukraine de-escalates. Military analysts predict the border could become a hot spot, particularly in the Arctic Circle, prompting Finland to prepare for a potential increase in Russian troop levels.</p>

          <p>A historian argues that Russia's current actions in Ukraine mirror the Soviet Union's occupation of Eastern Europe, characterized by violence, oppression, and the erasure of national identity. The author contends that the failure to acknowledge and condemn the Soviet occupation has enabled Russia to repeat these crimes, including forced citizenship, property confiscation, and the suppression of Ukrainian culture. The invasion of Ukraine represents a moral climate change, eroding political landscapes and undermining international norms. The author calls for greater understanding of the Soviet occupation and the construction of cultural bridges to counter Russia's divisive tactics.</p>
