        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally addressed White House inquiries regarding cost overruns in the renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters. In a letter, Powell directed critics to a new public webpage detailing the project and refuted claims of luxurious amenities, such as a private elevator or rooftop garden. This exchange is part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration, which has accused Powell of mismanagement amid disagreements over interest rate policies. Despite the non-confrontational reply, the White House and some congressional Republicans plan to continue their investigation into the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant increase in flight cancellations has impacted U.S. air travel this summer, with the national rate rising by 29% compared to the same period in 2024. Data analysis reveals that East Coast airports have been hit hardest, with Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) seeing a 274% spike in its cancellation rate. Other major hubs like Atlanta and Washington Dulles have also experienced substantial disruptions. In contrast, airports in Miami, San Francisco, and Chicago have seen improved performance with fewer cancellations, highlighting a varied landscape for travelers across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the judicial unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move follows renewed media attention and pressure from both political parties for greater transparency regarding the Justice Department's files on the deceased sex offender. While the Attorney General's office stated its readiness to file the motion, legal experts note that releasing such transcripts is rare. Critics argue this action is insufficient, demanding the release of all evidence, including videos and interview notes, not just testimony related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Elise Stefanik is leveraging a viral photo, which sparked cheating allegations against a CEO, to criticize New York Governor Kathy Hochul and NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. In a social media post, Stefanik used the image to metaphorically link Mamdani with Hochul, whom she may challenge in the 2026 gubernatorial race. This political maneuver comes as both Stefanik and fellow Republican Rep. Mike Lawler are reportedly considering runs for governor. Recent polling, however, suggests Governor Hochul currently holds a significant lead over all potential Republican challengers in the state.</p>

The article outlines several key factors that influence its value, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates.

Short-term CDs offer flexibility, allowing investors to adapt to economic changes as the accounts mature in a year or less.

          <p>Millions of Americans with Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans could face substantial cost increases in 2026 due to a combination of factors. Insurers are proposing double-digit premium hikes, citing rising medical costs and policy uncertainty, with a median requested increase of 15% in initial filings. A more significant financial impact could come from the potential expiration of enhanced federal subsidies that have helped lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers since 2021. If Congress does not extend these COVID-era tax credits, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise dramatically, potentially causing many to lose their insurance.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes have erupted in the southern Syrian city of Suweida, with residents describing horrific scenes of violence and bodies left in the streets. The conflict, which began with tensions between local Druze and Bedouin tribes, escalated after the deployment of government forces intended to restore order. However, these forces, along with affiliated foreign fighters, are now accused of committing atrocities against civilians, including summary executions and looting. The UN has documented killings by government-affiliated groups, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports nearly 600 deaths since the fighting began.</p>

          <p>Sir Grant Shapps, the former UK defence secretary, has defended the government's decision to use a "super-injunction" to conceal a major data breach that exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who worked with British forces. He argued the secrecy was justified to save lives, as those on the list were at risk of execution by the Taliban. The data of nearly 19,000 Afghans, along with over 100 British officials, was inadvertently leaked in 2022 but not discovered until 2023. The government then covertly created a resettlement program for those affected, which has since relocated thousands to the UK.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting veins in the legs. The disclosure came after photographs showed the president with swollen ankles, prompting a medical evaluation. A memo from the White House physician described the condition as "benign and common" and confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. The condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool, and is typically managed with compression stockings and leg elevation.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to complete its third major signing of the summer after Brentford accepted a £65 million bid for winger Bryan Mbeumo. The deal for the 25-year-old Cameroon international could rise to £70 million with add-ons, making him Brentford's largest-ever sale. Mbeumo is expected to undergo a medical before the team departs for its pre-season tour in the United States. The signing is seen as an effort by new manager Ruben Amorim to add proven Premier League quality, versatility, and consistency to United's attack for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The successful primary campaign of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has brought a surge of Islamophobic attacks from political opponents and commentators, highlighting a persistent issue in American public life. The article argues that these attacks, which range from altering his appearance in ads to questioning his patriotism, are rooted in deep institutional biases. While individual prejudice exists everywhere, structural racism gives power to these tropes, shaping policy and public discourse. Mamdani's visibility and success present a challenge to these old stereotypes, but his rise also ensures he will continue to be a target for such bigotry.</p>

          <p>The Muslim community in Cincinnati, Ohio, is in shock following the detention of Imam Ayman Soliman by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during a routine check-in. Soliman, an Egyptian-born former hospital chaplain who was granted asylum in 2018, had his status terminated based on an alleged connection to a "Tier III" terrorist organization. His lawyers argue the government's reasoning is weak and may be retaliation for a previous lawsuit he filed. The detention has sparked protests and widespread fear among local Muslims, who worry that if a community leader can be targeted, no one is safe.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are heading into their rugby Test series against the Wallabies as unprecedented favorites, with bookmakers and even Australian polls predicting a series victory, possibly a 3-0 clean sweep. Australia is contending with injuries to key players and a lack of recent match play, making them significant underdogs. While a dominant Lions performance is expected, some argue that a hard-fought series against a competitive Wallabies side is necessary for the tour to be truly memorable. The first Test will be a crucial indicator of whether Australia's coach Joe Schmidt can engineer an upset against the powerful visiting squad.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upcoming House of Councilors election, nationalist parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are echoing rhetoric similar to Western far-right movements, blaming foreigners for crime and social disruption. This comes as Japan experiences a tourism boom and faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate. These parties advocate for restricting immigration and promoting Japanese exclusivity, tapping into public frustration over economic issues and perceived erosion of cultural norms, creating a new political challenge for the government.</p>

This strategy aims to strengthen the domestic economy as a reliable growth engine amid an uncertain global trade environment.

          <p>A 1978 neo-Nazi novel, "The Turner Diaries," continues to exert a dangerous influence on American culture and politics, according to a recent analysis. The book, which fantastically depicts a race war culminating in genocide, has served as a direct inspiration for domestic terrorists and has helped popularize hateful ideas that now echo in mainstream political rhetoric. The article details how the novel's themes of white grievance, anti-immigrant sentiment, and violence against "race traitors" align with talking points from the far-right and even some government policies. It also highlights how the book is easily available for purchase online, sometimes marketed as a simple "action-adventure novel."</p>

Surveys from Gallup and Pew Research Center indicate a sharp drop in the number of Americans wanting less immigration and a record high in those viewing it as a "good thing" for the country. This "thermostatic" shift appears to be a reaction to President Trump's implementation of his hardline immigration agenda. While there is still support for some specific enforcement policies, broad disapproval of his administration's handling of the issue is growing.</p>
