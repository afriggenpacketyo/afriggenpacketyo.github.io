          <p>A bomb explosion outside a California fertility clinic has killed one person and injured four others, with the FBI declaring it an intentional act of terrorism. The suspect, identified as Guy Edward Bartkus, held anti-IVF views and opposed population growth, according to law enforcement sources. The blast, caused by a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, severely damaged nearby buildings, though the clinic's lab and sensitive medical areas remained secure. The Center for Reproductive Rights condemned the attack, emphasizing the need for clinic protections amid heated political debates over reproductive rights. The governor of California said the state was coordinating with local and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has launched what it claims is the world's first commercial cryptography system resistant to quantum computer hacking. The system integrates Quantum Key Distribution, which uses quantum mechanics for secure key transmission, and Post-Quantum Cryptography, which relies on complex mathematical problems for data protection. The company also completed the first cross-regional quantum-encrypted phone call between Beijing and Hefei using this integrated system. As quantum computing advances, traditional cybersecurity frameworks face increasing threats, making this new system a potential game-changer for data security and communication.</p>

Pence cited national security concerns, stating that Qatar has a history of playing both sides and that accepting such a gift would be inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. He suggested that if Qatar wants to make a gift to the United States, they should invest the $400 million in infrastructure on a U.S. military base.

Despite the ongoing military operations, indirect cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas are taking place in Doha, Qatar.

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore has vetoed legislation that sought to make recommendations on how to remedy the harms caused by slavery and racial discrimination.

Moore stated that the state had already sufficiently studied the legacy of slavery and that the time was now for action, not more study.

According to growers, this spring's dry weather has contributed to a really good crop, with strawberries being a good size and possessing exceptional sweetness. Despite drought warnings, farmers have irrigation systems in place, though some rain would still be welcome. This year's season contrasts with the wet winter of 2024, which delayed ripening, and climate change is contributing to more frequent spells of hot weather.</p>

          <p>New Jersey is experiencing significant transportation disruptions due to a locomotive engineers' strike, sinkholes on Interstate 80, and issues at Newark Liberty International Airport. The strike has shut down NJ Transit's rail service, impacting commuters across the state. Sinkholes have closed lanes on I-80, causing traffic delays, while Newark Airport faces runway closures, technology outages, and a shortage of air traffic controllers. Residents are experiencing travel chaos, leading to frustration and delays in their daily routines, and prompting reflection on the state's normally constant movement.</p>

          <p>Hawaii is renowned for lei-making, an ancient tradition that is still popular on the island today. The future of the craft could be in peril, as flower farms disappear and remaining land overheats due to the effects of climate change. A Hawaiian native learned the art of making leis from her grandmother and published a book called "Lei Aloha" to celebrate her traditions. The designs are endless with dozens of species of flowers growing on the islands.</p>

A Harvard student heard and suggested a solution using microchip manufacturing technology that his lab had recently developed. The casual exchange led to a collaboration under the guidance of Donald Ingber, a Harvard cell biologist, that eventually helped pioneer organ-chip technology.</p>
