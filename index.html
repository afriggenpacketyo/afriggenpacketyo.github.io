          <h2>German Schools Experiment with Smartphone Bans to Improve Student Focus</h2>

          <p>Several German states are considering banning smartphones in schools, with one high school in North Rhine-Westphalia already piloting the initiative. Students are required to keep their phones turned off in their bags during the school day, including recess, to encourage more interaction and less distraction. Teachers have reported that students are more relaxed and less distracted during lessons. Research suggests that smartphone bans can increase social well-being and reduce cyberbullying, leading other countries like France and the Netherlands to implement similar policies.</p>

          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett voiced concerns about President Trump's trade policies, stating that "trade should not be a weapon." He cautioned that protectionist measures could negatively impact the U.S. in the long run, especially considering the country's position as a leading industrial nation. Buffett highlighted the uncertainty tariffs and geopolitical events are creating for Berkshire, which has been defensively selling stocks for ten consecutive quarters, increasing its cash reserves to a record $347 billion. He also noted that trade and tariffs "can be an act of war."</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are reportedly considering offering deeper cooperation with the United States on combating fentanyl production and trafficking to ease trade tensions. This potential offer involves sending a top security official to Washington for talks, signaling China's willingness to address U.S. concerns. Historically, China has used its cooperation on fentanyl as a bargaining chip in broader diplomatic relations, as seen during the Trump administration when a ban on fentanyl variants followed trade disputes. However, China has previously resisted pressure to act on fentanyl while facing tariffs, viewing the crisis as a reflection of U.S. domestic issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that grocery and gas prices are falling, but economists say this is misleading. While overall inflation has eased slightly, grocery prices have actually increased, and gas prices have remained relatively flat since Trump took office. The rise in egg prices, exacerbated by bird flu, further contradicts Trump's assertions. Experts suggest that the decline in oil prices, while seemingly positive, reflects expectations of an economic slowdown due to Trump's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Child and family therapists have identified the top six things kids worry about most, including social dynamics, social media, big life changes, packed schedules, inconsistency, and trauma. The rise of social media amplifies worries about social dynamics and negatively impacts self-worth as children compare their lives to others online. Changes like moving to a new house or school, or even the arrival of a new sibling, can cause anxiety. The therapists recommend strategies like naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, using affirming phrases, and scheduling a 'worry window' to help children manage their anxieties.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating earnings, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant plunge in insurance-underwriting profit, which was impacted by Southern California wildfires. The conglomerate also cited tariffs and geopolitical events as creating "considerable uncertainty," making it difficult to predict their potential impact. The dollar's loss of value in the first quarter further contributed to the decline, resulting in a $713 million loss related to foreign exchange. Warren Buffett has been in a defensive mode, selling stocks for 10 straight quarters, and Berkshire's cash pile has grown to $347 billion.</p>

          <p>The death of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has sparked conspiracy theories, fueled by figures like Donald Trump Jr. These theories insinuate that Giuffre was silenced, ignoring the well-documented long-term effects of childhood sexual assault, including substance abuse and suicide. The article argues that the real conspiracy is society's tendency to protect powerful predators and their enablers, allowing them to evade justice while victims' lives are often destroyed. The author points to the lack of accountability for Epstein's accomplices and the prevalence of misogyny in societal institutions.</p>

          <p>Happiness research suggests that young people can only really flourish when they have "real-life human contact and love," highlighting the importance of social connection and community for well-being. Social connection aids in finding meaning and feeling that one’s life has purpose. Young people face roadblocks to finding that meaning, such as the decline of organized religion and the difficulty of finding alternative communities, especially with increased technology use. Putting close relationships with family and friends before virtually everything else is key.</p>
