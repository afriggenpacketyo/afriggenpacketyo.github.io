          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 05:03:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace stated he has "no apology" for seeking a court injunction to prevent reporting on a major data breach. The leak exposed personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK relocation, potentially putting them at risk from the Taliban. Wallace argued the priority was protecting lives, though critics, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith, believe Parliament should have been informed sooner about the breach and the subsequent £850m resettlement scheme. The gagging order was recently lifted by a High Court judge, bringing the issue to public light.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Co-op, Shirine Khoury-Haq, has confirmed that a cyber-attack in April compromised the personal data of all 6.5 million members. While no financial information was stolen, names, addresses, and contact details were accessed by the hackers. Khoury-Haq expressed deep regret for the breach and its impact on customers and colleagues, but stated she would not resign. The incident was part of a series of attacks that also targeted M&S and Harrods, leading to four arrests by the National Crime Agency.</p>

          <p>According to data from International Data Corporation (IDC), Huawei has reclaimed the top spot in China's smartphone market for the second quarter, its first time leading since 2020. The company achieved an 18.1% market share despite an overall 4% contraction in the Chinese smartphone market. This resurgence highlights Huawei's strong brand appeal and effective management, even as competitors like Vivo and Oppo followed behind. Apple ranked fifth, maintaining its position partly through strategic price adjustments to align with government subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng has advocated for a global supply chain system based on free trade and the comparative advantages of all nations. Speaking at an international expo, he criticized some countries for promoting "manufacturing reshoring" and imposing tariffs under the guise of "de-risking," which he argued reduces global economic efficiency. He emphasized that there are no winners in trade wars, highlighting ongoing tensions between China, the US, and the European Union over the future of global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in the year to June, its highest level since January 2024 and up from 3.4% in May. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the increase to higher prices for food, clothing, and transport, including air and rail fares. This development complicates the economic outlook, as inflation remains well above the Bank of England's 2% target, though an interest rate cut is still anticipated next month. Consumers report feeling the squeeze from the rising cost of living on daily essentials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is facing significant delays in upgrading its national power grid, struggling to keep pace with its rapid expansion of renewable energy sources. The country needs new high-voltage lines to transport wind power from the north to industrial centers in the south, but progress is slow due to complex, multi-step approval processes and local opposition. Grid operators cite skilled labor shortages and supply bottlenecks as additional hurdles, while the high cost of burying cables underground instead of using overhead lines adds billions to the project's expense. The delays threaten to hamper Germany's goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2045.</p>

While penalties like fines and World Test Championship point deductions exist, they have had limited impact.

          <p>The 95th MLB All-Star Game was decided by a home run "swing-off" for the first time in history, with the National League defeating the American League 4-3 in the tiebreaker for a 7-6 overall victory. After the game ended tied, three players from each team took three swings to hit the most home runs. Philadelphia Phillies star Kyle Schwarber hit three consecutive home runs to secure the win and was named MVP. The unique and exciting finish was pitched by Dodgers third base coach Dino Ebel, who threw batting practice for the NL hitters.</p>

          <p>An ongoing shift away from the US dollar's global dominance is accelerating due to eroding trust in Washington's financial stewardship, according to this analysis. The Brics nations are increasingly trading in their national currencies, while African countries are exploring sovereign monetary policies to break from colonial-era systems. The weaponization of the dollar through sanctions, coupled with massive US national debt and deficit spending on foreign conflicts, is prompting even European allies to reconsider their reliance on the US. This article argues the world is transitioning towards a multi-polar currency system. (not investment advice)</p>

The admission came after internet users noticed that descriptions and data in the Pingle document were nearly identical to those from Anhua county, located 400km away in another province. An official involved stated that a third-party company was contracted to prepare the document and likely used the other county's data as a reference without modifying it.

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on the Justice Department to release all "credible" information related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, passing responsibility to Attorney General Pam Bondi. The move comes amid pressure from his own supporters in the MAGA movement, who are demanding transparency and the release of a supposed client list. A recent DOJ memo stating no such list exists has fueled conspiracy theories and division. Trump's call for disclosure is a shift from his previous claims that the files were fabricated, highlighting the political tightrope he walks on the issue.</p>

          <p>This analysis highlights a severe and accelerating crisis in the UK retail sector, with thousands of store closures and job losses expected this year.

Well-known brands like New Look and River Island are struggling, following the path of many others that have already closed. The article suggests the downturn may be structural, not just cyclical, as vacant storefronts are increasingly common, fundamentally changing the landscape of British high streets.

          <p>Twenty years before this week's Open Championship, a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy shot a course-record 61 at Royal Portrush, a round that those present describe as legendary.

The round, which McIlroy later said he remembered shot-for-shot, cemented his status as a superstar in the making.

          <p>This analysis argues that President Donald Trump's recent shift to support Ukraine is not based on strategic enlightenment but on transactional calculations. After European NATO members committed to higher defense spending and agreed to fund Patriot missile systems for Kyiv, Trump has softened his stance, viewing Europe as a better "client" than Russia. The article suggests that while this provides temporary relief for Ukraine, Trump's support remains fickle and dependent on who he feels is paying their share.

The original military court conviction is being re-examined based on claims of torture and procedural flaws.
