          <p>A Lisbon funicular crash resulted in 16 deaths and over 20 injuries, prompting a somber response from Portuguese officials. The accident involved the Elevador da Gloria funicular, which derailed and collided with a building. Victims included nationals from South Korea, Switzerland, the U.S., and Portugal, with possible casualties from Canada, Germany, and Ukraine, according to authorities. The President of Portugal called for a swift investigation into the causes of the crash, while the public transport operator, Carris, initiated its own probe and suspended funicular operations for inspection. The incident has shaken the city, leading to three days of mourning and raising questions about the safety of Lisbon's historic transportation systems. </p>

The proposal would also give Musk more voting power within the company, which he has been requesting since early 2024. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm stated that the plan is intended to keep Musk motivated and focused on delivering for the company, with rewards tied to ambitious market capitalization and operational targets. Shareholders will also vote on whether Tesla should invest in Musk's AI venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities raided a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia, detaining 450 individuals during a search that halted construction on a nearby EV battery plant. The operation, involving multiple federal and state agencies, is part of an ongoing criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes. The South Korean Foreign Ministry expressed concerns about the rights and interests of Korean citizens and companies during the operation. Hyundai and its battery partner, LG Energy Solution, are cooperating with authorities, while operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant were not affected. </p>

          <p>A French couple received suspended jail sentences for illegally keeping a black panther named Louise in their apartment, after the animal escaped and was found roaming on rooftops. The court condemned the man to 18 months in jail, suspended, and a $17,000 fine, while the woman received a four-month suspended sentence. Animal rights groups argued that keeping Louise was a form of species trafficking and mistreatment, as the animal's needs could not be met in captivity. Louise, now renamed Akilla, resides at a big cat sanctuary in the Netherlands and is reportedly doing well. </p>

          <p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani challenged President Trump to a debate in New York City after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of mayoral debates. Cuomo had challenged Mamdani to five debates, one in each borough, pushing for other candidates to end their campaigns. Mamdani responded by challenging Trump directly, accusing him of cutting SNAP benefits for New Yorkers to fund tax cuts for billionaires. The mayoral race has become a focal point, with Trump expressing his desire to see a one-on-one race and sources suggesting potential job offers to entice other candidates to drop out. </p>

Demonstrators displayed a large "SOS" sign in Tel Aviv and gathered near Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence, while released hostages spoke about their experiences in captivity.

          <p>A new study reveals that Chinese citizens are divided over whether China should seek global dominance or share leadership in world affairs. While a majority does not view the U.S. as a friend, they favor a balanced approach toward Washington, cooperating when possible and limiting U.S. power when necessary. The top two perceived threats to China involve the United States: economic competition and potential conflict over Taiwan. Most Chinese citizens support their country's participation in world affairs and believe international trade is beneficial, contrasting with opinions in the U.S. The study provides unique insights into Chinese views on international relations amid global instability. </p>

Only a small fraction of registered donors die in circumstances suitable for organ retrieval, and families can block donations. Living donation is also limited by psychological and practical barriers, such as costs and lengthy evaluations. Medical mistrust and religious concerns also contribute to low registration rates. The End Kidney Deaths Act, which would provide tax credits to kidney donors, is presented as a potential solution to increase donation rates. </p>

          <h2>COVID Vaccine Access Issues Spark Anger Amid Case Surge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>People are facing difficulties accessing COVID vaccines as cases surge, leading to growing frustration directed towards the Trump administration. New guidelines require adults under 65 to consult with a healthcare professional before receiving the updated vaccine, creating additional hurdles. Pharmacists are unclear about their role in authorizing vaccinations, and some states require prescriptions for the vaccine at pharmacies. Doctors and pharmacists warn that these restrictions will discourage vaccinations, even as a late summer COVID wave spreads. The confusion and delays have prompted criticism, with concerns that the actions are politically motivated and compromise public health. </p>

          <p>Residents of Olive Dell Ranch, a nudist colony in Southern California, are suing the owners, alleging they are being forced out through neglect and policy changes. The lawsuit claims that the owners, who purchased the ranch in 2019, have stopped maintaining facilities, imposed mandatory clothing rules, and issued informal eviction notices to drive up property values. Residents also cite a double homicide on site and a lack of security as contributing to their distress. The plaintiffs, including tenants and members, are seeking at least $5 million in damages for civil rights violations, unfair business practices, and other alleged offenses. </p>

          <p>A study suggests that a single dose of LSD can alleviate anxiety and depression for months, particularly in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Participants receiving higher doses of LSD (100 or 200 micrograms) showed significant improvements by the next day, which lasted throughout the 12-week study. However, some experts caution that non-drug factors, such as the sensory environment during treatment, may have influenced the results. The research represents a growing trend in psychedelic studies, with larger, more rigorous trials aimed at gaining FDA approval for psychedelic drugs like LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin to treat psychiatric conditions. </p>

          <p>Renewables giant Orsted received shareholder approval for its emergency rights issue after a fresh profit warning and amid attacks by U.S. President Donald Trump on offshore wind projects. The White House abruptly ordered the company to halt work on Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, prompting Orsted to sue the Trump administration. Despite the challenges, investors welcomed the reprieve, and Orsted shares rose. The company also cut its full-year operating profit outlook due to lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the speculation surrounding President Trump's health and the wishful thinking among his political enemies that his age and potential health issues might solve their problems. While Trump's health is a legitimate concern, relying on his mortality to defeat him is a risky strategy. The author argues that strongmen often outlive their enemies, and Democrats should focus on winning at the ballot box rather than hoping for a "Deus ex machina." The article suggests that relying on Trump's health to solve political problems is a short-sighted and potentially dangerous approach. </p>

          <p>European stock markets were higher Friday, as investors await a key U.S. jobs report that's likely to set expectations for an upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Shares of Orsted were up after the Danish wind farm developer secured shareholder approval for its emergency rights issue, which comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump's sustained attacks on offshore wind projects. The company nudged lower its full-year earnings guidance, but Norwegian oil giant Equinor said it would participate in Orsted's planned capital raise. Sentiment brightened on Thursday as U.S. payrolls data boosted market bets on a Fed rate cut in September.  (not investment advice)</p>

Pacific royalty and chiefs were present during Nga Wai's first official speech. The king or queen's position is mainly ceremonial and does not enjoy legal powers, however, it plays a significant symbolic and cultural role in the community and also exerts national influence. </p>

Since the Alaska meeting between Putin and US President Donald Trump, the "Coalition of the Willing" has been working on providing Kyiv with guarantees if an agreement is reached. Kyiv believes a ceasefire should be agreed in Ukraine before any attempt at securing a broader peace deal, although Russia disagrees. </p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release new jobs data, the first since President Trump fired the top official tasked with compiling labor statistics. The removal of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer came hours after the release of a weak jobs report last month. Economists expect U.S. employers to have hired 75,000 workers in August, which would mark better hiring than recent months but come in well below the pace recorded earlier in the year. As a replacement for McEntarfer, Trump nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation.  (not investment advice)</p>
