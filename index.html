          <p>Shares for chipmaker Broadcom jumped 11% following an earnings call where the company announced a new $10 billion order from a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips. While Broadcom did not name the client, analysts from Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald, and KeyBanc widely believe it to be the AI startup OpenAI. This significant order has boosted Broadcom's AI revenue forecast for the upcoming year, with shipments expected to begin in 2026. The news reinforces the company's strong position in the AI hardware market alongside competitors like Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report released by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party alleges that the Pentagon has funded numerous research projects in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes linked to China's defense industry. The investigation found that some of these entities were already blacklisted by the U.S. government. The report argues that these partnerships risk strengthening a strategic competitor by allowing China to exploit American research for its own military advancements. Some defense officials have countered that research should remain open as long as it is not classified. </p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned as the UK's deputy prime minister and housing secretary after an ethics inquiry found she breached the ministerial code by failing to pay sufficient tax on a property sale. While the inquiry noted she "acted with integrity," it concluded she did not meet the highest standards expected. Rayner, who also stepped down as deputy Labour leader, accepted full responsibility for the error. Her departure prompted a significant cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with David Lammy appointed as the new deputy prime minister and Yvette Cooper becoming foreign secretary.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the Democratic party's recurring strategy of labeling President Trump's controversial actions as mere distractions from his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues that this tactic, while politically convenient, diminishes the seriousness of Trump's more authoritarian moves, such as deploying the National Guard in cities. By constantly pointing to the Epstein files, Democrats risk implying that the president's daily abuses of power are just stunts that can be ignored. The article suggests this approach reveals a lack of imagination and a failure to form more effective lines of attack against the administration.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, this article breaks down the significant tax bill a potential winner would face. The winner can choose between an annuity worth the full amount or a lump sum cash option of approximately $826.4 million. Regardless of the choice, the prize is subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding upfront, which would reduce the cash option by about $198.3 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, millions more would be owed at tax time, in addition to potential state taxes.

Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that under the agreement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 to new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring. The state had sued the Los Angeles County community last year, arguing the ban violated fair housing and anti-discrimination laws.

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to keep more of their prize after federal taxes are paid. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would result in the lowest after-tax payout. The report also explores historical data on the most and least frequently drawn numbers, while noting that the odds of winning the jackpot remain extremely low at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

This slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty, particularly surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs, which has made businesses hesitant to hire.

          <p>With global stock markets at all-time highs, this article outlines advice for investors on how to preserve their portfolio gains amid growing economic uncertainty. Experts suggest that while a Federal Reserve rate cut is anticipated, a weakening labor market could signal broader trouble ahead. They warn that many portfolios are overly concentrated in a few mega-cap technology stocks, creating significant risk. To mitigate this, investors are advised to re-evaluate their exposure and consider shifting some capital into undervalued defensive sectors that have not participated in the recent market rally.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has eliminated nearly 100 jobs in recent months, a direct result of significant cuts in its federal funding. A PBS spokesperson confirmed that 34 staff members were laid off this week, bringing the total to almost 100. The workforce reduction follows a congressional vote in July to eliminate $1.1 billion in funding for public broadcasting, which has left the network's 350 member stations in a precarious financial position. In response to the funding crisis, PBS also announced a 21% cut to its overall budget last month.</p>

          <p>Ticket sales at Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center have plummeted since President Donald Trump took over as its chairman, with audiences reportedly staying away in protest. An analysis by Washingtonian magazine reveals that upcoming performances, such as the prestigious Stuttgart Ballet, are expected to play to houses less than 20% full. Subscription revenue is reportedly down by about 50%, and the new Trump-appointed leadership recently fired the dance programming team. The decline in patronage reflects a backlash against the president's direct involvement in the management and operations of the nation's premier performing arts venue.</p>

          <p>The industrial warehouse sector, a top performer in commercial real estate since the pandemic, is now facing a significant slowdown. According to a report from NAIOP, demand for industrial space fell by 11.3 million square feet in the second quarter, marking the first quarterly decline since 2010. This downturn is attributed to economic uncertainty driven by changing tariff policies and high inflation, which has caused businesses to pause expansion plans. While the sector saw massive growth from 2020 to 2022, projections for the remainder of this year suggest that net absorption will be nearly flat. (not investment advice)</p>

He predicted a major rift in the ruling Labour Party could precipitate an early election and positioned Reform as the country's "last chance" to get back on track. Farage announced the creation of a new department to prepare for government and reiterated key policies, including stopping illegal immigration, scrapping net zero targets, and implementing zero-tolerance policing.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.50%, its lowest level since October 2024, providing some relief for potential homebuyers. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce a reduction at its next meeting. Lenders often lower their rates preemptively in response to expected Fed actions and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. While rates are still relatively high, the downward trend is an encouraging development for a housing market that has been constrained by high borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, enabling the U.S. to punish countries that illegally detain American citizens. This measure, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, will provide the State Department with tools to penalize nations using detained Americans as political leverage. The move aims to deter the practice and encourage the release of currently held individuals. The order follows several high-profile cases where Americans, such as Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, were detained in countries like Russia and later released in prisoner swaps.</p>

The decision comes amid a national trend of rising non-medical vaccine exemptions and declining vaccination rates since the pandemic.

Heirs of Robert Graetz, a Jewish businessman deported by the Nazis in 1942, have filed a restitution claim, arguing he was the original owner.

The SALT deduction primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who can deduct property and state income taxes from their federal tax liability.
