          <p>Nicholas Rossi, 38, was sentenced to five years in prison in Utah for sexual assault, the first of two convictions from 2008. The victim described a "trail of fear, pain, and destruction" left by Rossi, who prosecutors claim uses sexual assault to control women. Rossi maintained his innocence, despite being identified by a decade-old DNA kit and arrested in Scotland after faking his death and fleeing the U.S. He was extradited in January 2024 after a protracted legal battle, having used multiple aliases.</p>

Younger generations, while more optimistic about long-term growth, show higher concern for a potential recession.

          <p>The article describes the overwhelming surge of AI-generated content, termed "slop," as an invasive species polluting the internet. From contextless videos on new social networks like Meta's Vibes to AI-generated articles surpassing human-written ones, this content is creating an "infrastructure of meaninglessness." Critics argue this frictionless creation devalues human craft and agency, leading to psychological disorientation and potential "model collapse" as AI trains on its own synthetic output. This phenomenon raises concerns about the future of creativity, truth, and human connection online.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported a major outage affecting its US-East-1 region, causing widespread disruptions to numerous websites and services globally. The issue, initially identified as a DNS problem with DynamoDB, led to increased error rates for customers launching new EC2 instances. While AWS reported mitigating the DNS issue and signs of recovery, a backlog of data processing persisted for hours. This event underscores the world's reliance on a few major cloud providers and the cascading impact of technical faults within their infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Two abuse survivors, Fiona Goddard and Ellie-Ann Reynolds, have resigned from the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, citing concerns over the shortlisted chairs and a lack of transparency. Goddard criticized the selection of former police and social workers, calling it a "disturbing conflict of interest" given these services' past failures. The Home Office denied claims of watering down the inquiry and committed to collecting ethnicity data of perpetrators, but survivors and legal experts demand an impartial, senior judicial lead to restore faith.</p>

China's 5,000-year history, rooted in a land-bound culture focused on defending its agricultural heartlands, suggests a different "cultural DNA" than historical Western expansionism.

          <p>Ian Cleary was sentenced to two to four years in prison for sexually assaulting Shannon Keeler at Gettysburg College in 2013, a case that went unprosecuted for years. Keeler renewed her pursuit of charges after Cleary sent her a Facebook message stating, "So I raped you," which he claimed was part of a 12-step atonement program. The victim delivered a powerful statement detailing her decade-long struggle with authorities to prosecute campus sexual assault cases, emphasizing the systemic failures. Cleary apologized in court, citing mental health issues.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire, Hamas is reasserting its authority in Gaza, with masked men reportedly beating and executing opponents amidst a "complete loss of law and order." This occurs as President Trump's peace plan envisions Hamas laying down arms and handing control to an international force. While some Gazans see Hamas as a necessary interim force against criminal gangs, others fear their continued power. Despite significant losses to its leadership and infrastructure during two years of war, Hamas remains a dominant player, exploring rebranding for future political roles.</p>

          <p>A new study reports that a tiny eye implant, combined with special glasses, has significantly improved visual acuity and reading ability for some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) involves inserting a microchip under the retina, which then communicates with a camera in the glasses. While requiring concentration, patients like Sheila Irvine describe the ability to read and do crosswords again as "out of this world." This breakthrough offers hope for the 5 million worldwide affected by this leading cause of blindness.</p>

          <p>California health officials reported three unrelated cases of clade I mpox, a more severe strain, marking its first local spread within the U.S. All patients, who had no recent international travel, were hospitalized but are now recovering.

Officials emphasize vaccination with the Jynneos vaccine, which protects against both clades, as crucial for at-risk individuals, primarily gay and bisexual men and transgender or non-binary people who have sex with men.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has formally requested a federal judge dismiss his criminal charges, arguing he is a victim of selective prosecution driven by President Trump's "personal animus." Comey's lawyers cited Trump's social media posts as "smoking gun evidence" and challenged the unlawful appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, alleging she was a "stalking horse" to carry out Trump's wishes. They contend career prosecutors previously deemed charges unwarranted, and the indictment mischaracterizes Comey's congressional testimony, making it fatally flawed.</p>
