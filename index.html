        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this year focused on significant software updates rather than groundbreaking AI announcements. The company unveiled a new design language called Liquid Glass, which will revamp the look of iPhones, Macs, and Vision Pro headsets. This marks the first major redesign of the iPhone operating system since 2013, featuring glass-like lock screens and fluid animations. The unveiling, however, underwhelmed Wall Street, as investors are eager for Apple to demonstrate substantial advancements in its AI strategy to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI. Apple delayed its Apple Intelligence feature, citing the need for more time to meet quality standards, but restated that the feature will be released in the coming year. The company's timeline for the feature's release is still the coming year.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have experienced substantial growth over the past five years, driven by factors such as inflation and its reputation as a safe-haven asset. In June 2025, gold is priced at $3,343.44 per ounce, marking a significant increase from $1,729.29 in June 2020. This represents an approximate 93% rise in value, prompting investors to monitor the market for buying opportunities during price dips. Experts anticipate that gold could reach $4,000 per ounce, which is a substantial increase for an asset traditionally known for protecting income rather than rapid appreciation.

          <p>A veteran Greek hiker, Christos Stavrianidis, died after falling into a 2,600-foot ravine in Fraktou forest following an encounter with a bear. According to a fellow hiker, Dimitris Kioroglou, a bear attacked him, and after using pepper spray, the bear turned towards Stavrianidis and knocked him into the ravine. Wildlife experts suggest the bear was likely acting defensively, trying to neutralize what it perceived as a threat. The hikers were exploring the site of a crashed Greek warplane discovered by Stavrianidis, who had been working to create an accessible route to the wreckage.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, asserting that California Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass failed to protect ICE agents and citizens from violent rioters. Hegseth argued that the President has the legal authority to deploy troops due to attacks on ICE agents and property damage, citing instances where Mexican and other foreign flags were waved. Representative Pete Aguilar questioned the legal basis for the deployment, but Hegseth responded that the situation seemed to encompass invasion, rebellion, and inability to execute U.S. laws. The deployment is expected to cost $134 million, funded from regular operational accounts.</p>

Currently, short-term CDs offer slightly higher rates than high-yield savings accounts, but high-yield savings account rates can change over time. For example, a $10,000 6-month CD at 4.49% would earn $222.04, while a $10,000 high-yield savings account at 4.25% would earn $210.29 over the same period.
