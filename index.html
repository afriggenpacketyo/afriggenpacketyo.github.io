          <p>At the San Sebastian Film Festival, Angelina Jolie voiced deep concern about the state of America, stating she no longer recognizes her country due to perceived divisions and limitations on personal freedoms. The actress, who has long expressed a desire to live internationally, explained her continued presence in Los Angeles is primarily due to divorce-related custody arrangements. She anticipates moving abroad once her youngest children turn 18, seeking greater privacy and a global perspective she feels is lacking in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Monday, mirroring Wall Street's positive close, as investors reacted to China's decision to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The People's Bank of China maintained the one-year LPR at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, diverging from the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. This stability in China's lending rates contributed to upward movement in key indices across Japan, South Korea, and Australia, despite global economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Dominican Republic announced the recovery of 377 packages of cocaine from a speedboat destroyed by the U.S. Navy in a joint operation, which they hailed as a historic first against "narcoterrorism" in the Caribbean. The vessel, believed to be carrying 1,000 kilograms of the drug, was intercepted south of Isla Beata while allegedly attempting to use the Dominican Republic as a transit point to the United States. This incident follows the Trump administration's deployment of naval assets to combat drug trafficking, a move that has drawn criticism from human rights groups regarding extrajudicial killings.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands gathered at State Farm Stadium for the memorial of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University. Speakers, including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, lauded Kirk as a "martyr" and "warrior" for the MAGA movement and Christian faith. His widow, Erika Kirk, delivered an emotional speech forgiving the alleged shooter and vowing to continue her husband's work. The event blended political rhetoric with Christian worship, underscoring Kirk's significant influence on the American right and the ongoing debate surrounding political violence.</p>

          <p>One person was killed and two others wounded in a shooting at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, with a suspect, Hunter Nadeau, now arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The incident occurred during a wedding reception, and the victims included a restaurant customer and an employee. Authorities identified the deceased as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare. Nadeau, a former employee, was apprehended quickly, and officials praised the "selfless acts of courage" by patrons who intervened, preventing further tragedy.

          <p>Scientists are observing the return of a significant "warm blob" in the North Pacific, characterized by unusually high sea surface temperatures, reaching a record 68 degrees Fahrenheit in August. This marine heatwave, the fourth largest since 1982, spans a vast area and has historically led to devastating impacts on marine ecosystems, including toxic algae blooms, mass mortality of seabirds, and collapses in fishing industries. Experts warn that this anomaly could influence winter weather patterns, potentially inducing a high-pressure ridge over the Pacific Northwest and plunging the Eastern United States into Arctic temperatures.</p>

Estonia previously reported three Russian MiG-31 jets violating its airspace, prompting Prime Minister Kristen Michal to invoke NATO's Article 4 for consultations.

Researchers at MIT are using CRISPR technology to insert an antibody gene into mouse embryos, creating heritable immunity.

          <p>Tens of millions of monarch butterflies embark on an epic annual migration from Mexico to Canada and the northern U.S., a journey spanning thousands of miles. A unique "super generation" of monarchs, born in late summer, can live up to nine months—nine times longer than typical monarchs—by suppressing reproductive hormones, enabling this arduous trip. Despite this natural marvel, the monarch population in Mexico has declined by 70% in 30 years due to illegal logging and the eradication of milkweed, their sole food source for caterpillars.

          <p>Dong Yu, executive vice-president of the China Institute for Development Planning, explains that every aspect of China's five-year plans ultimately focuses on increasing income to ensure sustainable national progress. Having contributed to multiple plans, Yu highlights their historical role in building China's economy from a state of impoverishment. He notes that while early plans faced challenges, those since the reform and opening-up period in 1978 have largely succeeded in meeting their targets. This perspective underscores the Chinese government's long-term economic strategy and its direct impact on citizens' livelihoods.</p>

          <p>The article highlights how investments of $7,000 in each of Palantir Technologies, AppLovin, and Carvana at the start of 2023 would now be worth over $1 million combined. These companies, previously unprofitable, have seen significant financial turnarounds, driven by improved economic conditions and a focus on AI solutions. Palantir's revenue surged with AI enhancements, AppLovin achieved explosive growth and profit margins through its Axon AI platform, and Carvana successfully restructured its debt. While these stocks show impressive returns, their current valuations are noted as high, with Carvana's business still carrying risk due to low margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, along with tech billionaires Larry Ellison and Michael Dell, are likely investors in a proposed deal to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. This potential sale is mandated by a recent Congressional law aimed at addressing fears that Beijing could access American users' personal data. Trump, who described the potential investors as "American patriots," expressed confidence in their ability to manage the platform. The White House anticipates a deal soon, which would grant significant influence over one of America's most popular social media apps to powerful media and tech families.</p>

While no watches or warnings are in effect for Bermuda, swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada, posing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung expressed support for a potential Trump-Kim deal to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure," rather than demanding immediate denuclearization. Lee views this as a "feasible, realistic alternative" given North Korea's continued nuclear expansion and rejection of talks since 2019. He believes President Trump and Kim Jong Un could resume talks due to their "degree of mutual trust." This pragmatic approach aims to reduce tensions and achieve some progress, even as Lee navigates complex relationships with the US, China, and Russia.</p>

Rachel Cowley's daughter, Jessica, now 20, is unable to walk or talk due to the progressive disease, for which there is no cure. Initially believed to be rare outside Japan, a 2007 study identified a higher prevalence in Wales, linked to "common founders." Families are seeking earlier genetic testing and hope from clinical trials in the US, despite ethical concerns about testing minors for a life-changing condition without a guaranteed treatment.</p>

While the airport anticipates up to 80 million passengers and job creation, the decision faces strong opposition from climate campaigners and local groups concerned about environmental impacts and noise.
