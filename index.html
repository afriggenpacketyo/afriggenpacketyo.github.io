        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president indicated a shift from a coalition government in his first term to a royal court in his second. The article suggests that Vance, unlike other potential candidates, was a loyalist who would not challenge Trump's decisions, symbolizing the absence of checks and balances in the second administration. Klein emphasizes that this choice revealed Trump's preference for yes-men and enforcers over advisors who might offer dissenting opinions, marking a fundamental change in the structure and operation of his presidency. The article concludes that the guardrails are gone.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall reflects on the importance of remembering victims of past atrocities, particularly those of World War II, while also urging awareness and outrage regarding ongoing conflicts and atrocities worldwide. The article highlights specific instances of violence and suffering in Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, and Gaza, emphasizing the need to avoid silence and complicity in the face of such horrors. The author criticizes the UN's ineffectiveness due to major power rivalries and funding shortages, and also points to the inability of international courts to sanction states or punish war criminals, which encourages impunity. The article calls for greater engagement and a rejection of the normalization of global breakdown.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, which granted EU citizenship to foreign investors, deeming it a mere commercial transaction. The court emphasized the need for a genuine link between member states and their citizens, and solidarity among EU countries. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, saying it had raised millions for charitable causes, the government has agreed to rework the system to align with the court's decision. Despite the ban on golden passports, "golden visas" allowing residence permits for investments remain prevalent, raising concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks. </p>

While it is still early to determine the long-term impact, the results indicate a shift in voter loyalties and an opening for alternative political voices.

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Liberty International Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing issues. The move comes after numerous delays and cancellations at the airport, with the FAA citing equipment problems, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia, where the traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is located. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has announced plans to revamp the air traffic control system, but the project is expected to take several years. Passengers have expressed frustration with the ongoing disruptions, and airlines are working to reschedule or refund tickets.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan revealed that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's law requiring couples to adopt the same surname. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that the rate was higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% of that group stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. Common-law couples lack the benefits of legal marriage, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights. This article highlights the ongoing debate in Japan over the surname law and its impact on personal choices.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with 12,000 new coffee shops opening in the past year, driven by aggressive expansion and price competition that make coffee more accessible to the masses. This expansion is fueled by President Xi Jinping's endorsement of domestic beans from Yunnan province. While the market is growing, Starbucks' market share has significantly declined, as new entrants with innovative business models and flavors gain traction. The growth is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities, highlighting the expanding coffee culture beyond major metropolitan areas.</p>
