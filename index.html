        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca condemned the decision to host the Club World Cup in the United States after a severe weather delay disrupted his team's match. The game was suspended for two hours due to thunderstorms, which Maresca called "a joke" and "not football," highlighting that it was the sixth such suspension in the tournament. These repeated weather-related issues, including extreme heat, raise significant concerns about the suitability of the US as a co-host for the upcoming 2026 World Cup, a point echoed by other teams and officials.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential bomb within a matter of months. This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi noted caused severe but not total damage, contradicting claims that the program was obliterated. Iran has since refused IAEA inspections of the damaged sites and voted to suspend cooperation, escalating diplomatic tensions while the true extent of the setback to its nuclear ambitions remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have reported that Russia launched its most massive aerial assault since the war began, firing over 500 drones and missiles overnight. The widespread attack targeted multiple regions, including areas in western Ukraine far from the front lines, causing civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. Poland and allied nations scrambled aircraft to protect Polish airspace during the bombardment. This major escalation comes as international peace efforts remain stalled, with no immediate end to the conflict in sight.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the extent of the damage and the operation's primary objectives. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the facilities were "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the setback to Iran's program was only a matter of months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift their focus from facility destruction to framing the strike as a successful de-escalation that prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, leaving the true impact on Iran's nuclear capabilities ambiguous.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that California's public narratives, from visitor guides to museum plaques, systematically erase the state's authentic and often brutal Indigenous history. The author points out how institutions like UC Berkeley historically contributed to a fictional account that depicted Native peoples as vanished, ignoring their resistance to colonization, which involved massacres and ethnic cleansing. This whitewashed history, prevalent in everyday spaces, prevents a true understanding of the state's origins and the ongoing struggles of over 100 tribes for recognition and repatriation of ancestral remains.</p>

          <p>The recent bombing of Iranian nuclear sites reflects President Trump's evolving but consistent military doctrine, characterized by a willingness to authorize high-risk, discrete strikes rather than sustained campaigns. This "One-and-Done" approach was seen in his first term with actions like the Soleimani strike, contrasting with his aversion to "endless wars." Now in his second term, surrounded by more compliant advisers, Trump has applied this philosophy to Iran, framing the attack as a single, decisive blow. However, questions remain whether this one-off action will be sufficient to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions permanently.</p>

          <p>The surprisingly restrained reactions from China and Russia to the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran expose the weaknesses of their so-called anti-American axis. Despite shared antagonism toward the West, both nations refrained from offering significant military or diplomatic support to Tehran, prioritizing their own economic and strategic interests. This cautious approach suggests that when global stability is at risk, Beijing and Moscow are unwilling to fully back Iran, revealing that their "no limits" partnership is more conditional than advertised and bound more by convenience than a shared worldview.</p>

While some view it as a form of catharsis, mental health professionals express concern that the trend may normalize emotional dysregulation and discourage the development of healthier coping mechanisms.

          <p>The 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake serves as a reminder of California's seismic vulnerabilities and the lessons learned about building safety. The quake exposed the dangers of unreinforced brick structures, yet it took decades and further tragedies for many cities to mandate retrofitting. Experts note that even today, many areas have not required strengthening for other vulnerable building types, such as "soft-story" apartments. The historical event not only spurred early seismic building codes but also famously reshaped downtown Santa Barbara's architecture into its signature Spanish Colonial Revival style.</p>

          <p>In a joint op-ed, Sir Elton John and Jeanne White-Ginder, mother of Ryan White, celebrate the significant progress made in fighting HIV/AIDS but warn that proposed U.S. budget cuts threaten to reverse these gains. They highlight the success of the Ryan White CARE Act and the End the HIV Epidemic initiative in providing lifesaving treatment and reducing new infections. However, they express alarm over proposals to cut funding for HIV surveillance, testing, and prevention programs, as well as potential cuts to Medicaid, which covers care for over 40% of Americans living with HIV. They urge Congress to expand, not eliminate, these vital programs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for a ceasefire deal in Gaza to secure the return of hostages, while simultaneously criticizing the ongoing corruption trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a social media post, Trump called Netanyahu's trial a "POLITICAL WITCH HUNT" and questioned how the Israeli leader could negotiate effectively while being forced to appear in court. This direct intervention into the domestic legal affairs of a key ally has unsettled many in Israel, even as plans are reportedly being made for Netanyahu to visit Washington, signaling potential movement on a new deal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a searchable national citizenship data system, integrating Social Security and immigration databases, to allow election officials to verify voter eligibility. Developed without a public process, the tool is intended to ensure only citizens are voting, but its creation has alarmed privacy advocates and legal experts who worry about mass data consolidation and potential misuse. While it could ease the burden of proof on voters, experts question the data's accuracy and raise concerns about what the federal government will do with the voter records it processes, given the history of failed data-matching efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports are creating financial stress and uncertainty in the wedding industry, as nearly 90% of all U.S. wedding dresses are made in China. Brides and boutique owners are now grappling with surcharges and price hikes of up to 30% on gowns and accessories. The unpredictability of the tariffs makes it difficult for stores to budget, as dresses are often ordered months in advance. This situation has led to more hesitation from buyers and is unlikely to boost U.S. manufacturing, given the lack of a skilled domestic workforce for intricate gown-making.

          <p>Markus SÃ¶der, the state premier of Bavaria, has called for Germany to significantly bolster its defenses by acquiring a missile defense system akin to Israel's "Iron Dome," supported by 2,000 Patriot systems. In an interview, the influential politician also advocated for a massive expansion of the German military, including 100,000 new drones, hundreds of new tanks, and additional fighter jets and cruise missiles.

Bernstein, a gay and Jewish Ivy League student, was stabbed 28 times in 2018 by Woodward, who was a member of a violent neo-Nazi group. The prosecution argued the murder was motivated by hate, while the defense claimed Woodward was provoked after an alleged sexual advance.
