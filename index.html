          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the removal of all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a crucial government panel of vaccine advisors. Kennedy stated that this "clean sweep" is necessary to restore public confidence in vaccine science, alleging that the panel has been plagued by conflicts of interest and has become a rubber stamp for any vaccine. The ACIP advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and HHS, reviewing vaccine data and making recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them. Kennedy's move is the latest in his efforts to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S. since taking office. </p>

          <p>Approximately 700 U.S. Marines have been deployed to Los Angeles to support the California National Guard in protecting federal personnel and property, according to Defense Department officials. This mobilization follows President Trump's statement about potentially arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta plan to sue Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, arguing that the federalization of the National Guard is unlawful and exceeds presidential authority. The lawsuit claims Trump's action violates the U.S. Constitution because it occurred without Newsom's consent and was not warranted. </p>

          <p>The United States has historically been a top destination for students and scientific researchers from India and China, but recent policy changes by the Trump administration are causing some to reconsider their plans. These changes include increased scrutiny of student visa applications and threats to revoke some visas for Chinese students. These actions are prompting potential students to rethink their decision to study in the U.S., due to concerns about accessibility and political climate. The U.S. has long been seen as a hub for education and innovation, however, these policies are creating uncertainty and unease among international students.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement is being viewed as an escalation of his efforts to suppress dissent. This move bypasses California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority, as Newsom did not request the deployment. Critics argue that Trump is using the power of the state to suppress dissent and siccing the military on American citizens. Trump's actions are seen as part of a broader assault on democracy and an attack on the First Amendment, punishing people for exercising their right to free speech and protest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni accused the defendants of civil extortion and defamation after Lively filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment and retaliation by Baldoni, which he denies. A defamation lawsuit Baldoni filed against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's sexual harassment complaint, was also dismissed. The judge ruled that Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, could amend some of the claims by June 23. </p>

          <p>A new poll indicates a growing divergence between men and women regarding their support for abortion rights in the United States. Sixty-one percent of women identify as "pro-choice," while only 41% of men do, marking the largest gap in decades. This divergence has widened since the overturning of Roe v Wade, with women becoming more supportive of abortion access and men's support declining. Experts suggest that this shift is primarily due to changes in women's attitudes, as they have become more energized on the issue since Roe's collapse. </p>

However, the uneven distribution of these minerals and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges.
