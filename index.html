          <p>The United States government has reversed its export restrictions on chip-design software to China, allowing American companies like Synopsys and Cadence to resume business with the country. This move is viewed as a significant step in a broader trade truce between the two economic superpowers. The announcement had an immediate positive impact on the market, causing shares of the affected semiconductor software firms to rise sharply. The decision rescinds a policy from May that required U.S. firms to obtain special licenses for such exports.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to gather enough votes to advance President Trump's major domestic policy bill due to significant internal dissent. A crucial procedural vote was held open late into the evening as leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, worked to persuade holdouts from both conservative and moderate wings of the party. The bill, which was already altered by the Senate, includes substantial tax cuts and spending changes, but these modifications have alienated some House members who had previously supported it. The outcome remains highly uncertain given the GOP's slim majority.</p>

However, he was convicted on two counts of the lesser charge of transportation to engage in prostitution. The verdict concluded a high-profile, seven-week trial that included graphic testimony from former girlfriends. Combs, who has been in custody since his arrest, will now await sentencing for the convictions, each carrying a maximum of 10 years in prison.

          <p>With the Republican majority in the House of Representatives being exceptionally narrow, the possibility of a tie vote on significant legislation has become a relevant concern. This article explains that, unlike the Senate where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such provision. According to established House rules, if a vote on any question or bill results in a tie, the measure is automatically considered lost and fails to pass. This procedural reality underscores the immense challenge party leadership faces in maintaining unity on closely contested issues.</p>

          <p>A section of a wing flap from a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737 was discovered in the driveway of a home in Raleigh, North Carolina, after the aircraft landed safely at a nearby airport. The flight, which originated in Atlanta with 115 people on board, was found to be missing the part during a routine post-flight inspection. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed the discovered component belonged to the aircraft and has launched a formal investigation into the incident. Delta stated it is fully cooperating with retrieval efforts and the investigation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has issued a ruling that blocks the Trump administration's policy designed to ban migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. In his decision, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrote that the president had exceeded his legal authority, asserting that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supersedes laws passed by Congress. The judge has paused his ruling for 14 days to give the administration an opportunity to appeal, in a decision praised by civil liberties organizations as a crucial defense of asylum law.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his long-running criticism of the central bank's leader. In a social media post, Trump blamed Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to boost the U.S. economy. The demand followed comments from Powell suggesting that the Fed might have lowered rates sooner if not for the economic effects of Trump's own tariff policies. This move intensifies political pressure on the traditionally independent financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An official inspection has concluded that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly impeded because the city council supplied police with heavily redacted documents. According to the watchdog's report, some pages of evidence were so censored that they were rendered useless, making it impossible to assess their value and delaying probes into child sexual exploitation. Although a more effective information-sharing protocol has since been established, the initial failure required investigators to restart much of their work. The council attributed the redactions to complex legal rules around data privacy.</p>

This marks a substantial increase from the 36% he received in 2020. Political analysts suggest this trend is less about a move towards traditional conservatism and more reflective of a rising populist sentiment. Key factors cited include disillusionment with the Democratic Party's economic platforms and its approach to immigration policy, challenging long-held assumptions about this crucial and evolving voting bloc.</p>
