          <p>China is actively promoting its trans-Himalayan infrastructure projects in Nepal, signaling a strategic effort to increase its influence in the region. A top Chinese official visited Nepal to advance cooperation in key sectors like agriculture, energy, and health, aiming to bolster Nepal's economic development. This initiative occurs as Beijing competes with New Delhi for sway over the landlocked nation, which has traditionally been a close ally of India but has recently seen a surge in Chinese investment. The move underscores the ongoing geopolitical contest for influence in South Asia.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has achieved the remarkable feat of riding his bike down all 282 of the country's Munros. Sean Green is believed to be only the second person ever to complete this challenge, which involves climbing each mountain over 3,000 feet with a bike and then cycling down. The epic journey took him approximately eight and a half years to finish, combining his passion for the outdoors and mountain biking.

          <p>A study by the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles reveals that many Mexican nationals recently detained in immigration raids have long-established lives in the United States. Over half of the 330 individuals interviewed had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade, with more than a third residing there for over 20 years. Nearly a third of those detained also have U.S.-born children, challenging the narrative that they are recent arrivals. The findings highlight the deep community ties and economic contributions of these individuals, who work in various sectors.</p>

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport is reportedly planning to construct a specialized terminal to process the deportation of migrants. According to planning documents, the facility is intended to streamline the repatriation of individuals with rejected asylum claims or criminal convictions, with a projected completion date of 2028. The proposal has garnered support from conservative politicians who advocate for stronger deportation measures but has also drawn criticism from others, including the Green Party.

The 2-1 decision stated that the order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause is incorrect.

          <p>A high-ranking official from the Department of Justice is scheduled to meet with convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell in a Florida prison. The meeting comes as the Trump administration has pledged to release all credible evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell's attorney confirmed the discussions, stating that she "will always testify truthfully." Separately, the House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition, signaling continued high-level interest in what information she may possess about Epstein's network and any associated crimes.</p>

          <p>Frustrated with local opposition, or NIMBYism, a growing number of states are passing laws to force cities and counties to allow for more affordable and denser housing. States like Utah and Texas are overriding local zoning rules to tackle a nationwide housing shortage that has priced many people out of homeownership. While these state-level mandates aim to increase housing supply, they often face strong pushback from local communities concerned about overcrowding and loss of local control. The trend reflects a broader struggle to balance development needs with existing neighborhood character.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game provided an entertaining spectacle, but the absence of star Lionel Messi has intensified debates about the event's format and relevance. While the match against Liga MX stars offered a fun showcase of talent, Messi's decision to skip the event suggests top players may prioritize meaningful games over exhibitions. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to re-evaluate the All-Star game to keep it competitive and appealing to players and fans.

          <p>A major new study indicates that walking 7,000 steps a day, rather than the commonly cited 10,000, is sufficient to provide significant health benefits. Research published in The Lancet Public Health found this more achievable target is linked to a reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. The 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan and is not based on scientific evidence. Researchers suggest that promoting a 7,000-step goal could encourage more people to adopt a practical and effective way to improve their health.</p>

Suarez, who had no criminal record, was one of over 250 Venezuelan men accused of being gang members and sent to the notorious CECOT prison. He was recently released as part of a prisoner swap and recounts being beaten, humiliated, and told he would only leave "dead."

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. border officials to offer migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This changes a long-standing policy under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which required unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries to be transferred to government shelters. Under the new directive, if teens decline the option to self-deport, they will still be sent to the shelter system overseen by HHS. The policy shift, enabled by recent legislation, marks another significant change in U.S. immigration procedures for minors.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency (EA) in England has cancelled thousands of scheduled water tests for pollutants over the last three months due to significant staff shortages at its main laboratory. Internal documents reveal that key monitoring programs for substances like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural pollution, have been paused. Campaigners and former employees express concern that the lack of data will make it harder to track pollution trends. The EA states its testing program remains robust, but the cuts raise questions about its capacity to regulate water quality.</p>

While regulators say the rules will make it harder for children to see harmful material, concerns remain about user privacy and the potential for people to use VPNs to bypass the checks.
