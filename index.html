          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for his refusal to concede Crimea to Russia, asserting that this stance is detrimental to ongoing peace negotiations. Trump claims a deal to end the war was nearing completion but Zelenskyy's position is prolonging the conflict. This comes as US officials are reportedly intensifying efforts to broker a deal, with suggestions of a potential agreement involving territorial concessions from both Ukraine and Russia. The relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy has been historically strained, marked by disagreements and differing perspectives on the conflict's resolution.</p>

The lawsuit contends that these tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and create economic instability. This legal challenge follows a similar suit filed by small businesses, highlighting growing opposition to the administration's trade policies.</p>

They contrast this vision with Donald Trump's approach, which they see as a return to outdated industries and protectionist trade policies.

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir that resulted in the deaths of 26 people, India has announced a series of measures against Pakistan, including downgrading diplomatic ties and suspending the Indus Waters Treaty.

India's decision to suspend the treaty is contingent on Pakistan credibly ceasing its support for cross-border terrorism. The attack and subsequent response have heightened tensions between the two nations.</p>
