          <p>Rose Docherty, a 74-year-old grandmother in the U.K., was arrested for holding a sign outside an abortion clinic and is now raising concerns about the expansion of "buffer zones" that restrict free speech. Docherty's arrest occurred under the Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) Act, which prohibits protests within 200 meters of abortion clinics in Scotland. She argues that the government is attempting to suppress any opposition to abortion and believes that authorities will continue to crack down on individuals whose views differ from the government's, regardless of the buffer zone's size.</p>

          <p>Over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will reach its target of having women occupy 30 percent of top corporate roles by 2030, citing slow shifts in views among its male-dominated executive class. A Kyodo News survey indicated that 73 percent of senior women believe a shift in top management's views is necessary to increase female representation in senior roles, while 54 percent cited the need to change company culture. Despite government efforts, women held only 16.2 percent of high-level roles in Japan's top companies in 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has seen a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with approximately 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. This drop brings overdose deaths back to pre-pandemic levels, with 45 states recording declines, particularly in Ohio and West Virginia. The increasing availability of naloxone, policies from the COVID-19 pandemic, and opioid-settlement cash have contributed to this reversal. While synthetic opioids like fentanyl are declining, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat.</p>
