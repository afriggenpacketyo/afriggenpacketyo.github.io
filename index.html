          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, urging them to refocus on their core missions of global monetary cooperation and financial stability. Bessent argued that these institutions have suffered from "mission creep" by devoting resources to issues like climate change and gender. His remarks come after the IMF warned of negative impacts on the U.S. and global economy from President Trump's tariffs, and he emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to continue its leadership role in international institutions.</p>

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois announced his retirement after serving over four decades in Congress. Durbin, who has been a Senator since 1997 and currently serves as the Democratic whip, stated that it was time to "pass the torch." His departure will create a contentious race among Illinois Democrats to fill the seat, and will also leave a void in Democratic leadership in the Senate. Durbin served as the top Democrat of the Senate Judiciary Committee since 2021, helping to confirm 235 federal judges under former President Joe Biden.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to between 50% and 65%, according to The Wall Street Journal. The move is part of a recalibration of trade strategy that has roiled global markets for weeks, and stocks rallied on the report. While no final decisions have been made, options under review include a tiered system distinguishing between strategic and non-strategic goods, with lower tariffs on the latter. Trump stated that the duties "will not be as high as 145 per cent" and will come down substantially.</p>

          <p>Tim Walz, Kamala Harris's former running mate and the governor of Minnesota, is actively engaging in the national political scene following their defeat in the recent election. He has been touring various states, holding town halls and discussions, and expressing concern over the direction of the Democratic Party. Walz is trying to gauge the public sentiment and find ways to counter the Trump administration's policies. While he denies immediate presidential ambitions, his actions suggest a continued interest in national politics and a desire to fill what he perceives as a void in Democratic leadership.</p>

          <p>Despite its proven effectiveness in reducing opioid cravings and overdose deaths, buprenorphine remains underutilized in the United States due to stigma and regulatory barriers. The article explores the reasons behind this failure, highlighting the conflict between medication-assisted treatment and abstinence-based recovery models. It shares personal stories of individuals whose lives were impacted by buprenorphine, both positively and negatively, and discusses the challenges of implementing this treatment in a culture of abstinence. The article also addresses the complexities of using buprenorphine in the face of the rise of synthetic opioids like fentanyl.</p>

Factors contributing to this imbalance include trade war concerns, detentions of visitors, Trump's rhetoric, a strong U.S. dollar, and travel warnings.

Automotive executives and experts agree that more time would be helpful, but an additional 25% auto parts tariff is scheduled to take effect, raising costs even for vehicles assembled in the U.S. Relocating production lines takes years of planning and construction, requiring significant investment and infrastructure development. The fastest way to increase U.S. production is to use existing facilities, for which the supply chains have already been established.</p>
