          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, on Monday. This crucial meeting comes just days before the October 1st deadline to pass a spending bill and avert a government shutdown. Democrats are advocating for the bill to include extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits and a rollback of Medicaid cuts, while the White House has warned federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs if an agreement is not reached. The outcome will significantly impact federal workers and various government programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and home builders are cautioning that millions of Americans could lose flood insurance coverage if Democrats do not support a House-passed spending bill that includes reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). With the Sept. 30 government funding deadline approaching, the White House emphasizes the urgency of protecting policyholders during hurricane season. Administration officials warn that a lapse in NFIP authorization could disrupt thousands of property sales and leave many households without crucial coverage, potentially exacerbating disaster recovery challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an ambitious agricultural experiment, the UK has successfully grown its first commercial rice crop in east England, benefiting from the country's hottest summer on record. This trial, led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food production methods amidst climate change. Beyond food security, the project also seeks to re-wet peat soils in the Fens region, which could lock away greenhouse gases and contribute to climate mitigation efforts. The initiative highlights innovative approaches to farming in a changing climate.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sanctions on Iran, effective Sunday, targeting its nuclear program and further straining the nation's economy. This 'snapback' mechanism, part of the 2015 nuclear deal, will freeze Iranian assets and halt arms deals, impacting a populace already struggling with record-low currency and soaring food prices. Activists also express concerns about increased internal repression and the potential for renewed conflict with Israel or the United States. Iran's leadership maintains its nuclear program is peaceful but has withdrawn from some IAEA monitoring, escalating international tensions.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media industry, with recent deals involving major companies like TikTok and Paramount. Larry Ellison's close ties with President Trump have facilitated these ventures, including Oracle's increased role with TikTok and Skydance's acquisition of Paramount. The family is also reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Brothers Discovery, potentially creating one of the largest media giants. This concentration of media power has drawn criticism from lawmakers concerned about potential conflicts of interest and journalistic independence.</p>

          <p>Thousands marched in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to demand justice for three young women whose torture and murders were reportedly broadcast live on social media. The victims, Morena Verdi, Brenda Del Castillo, and Lara Gutierrez, were found buried five days after their disappearance.

PFAS compounds are linked to serious health issues like cancer and immune system disruption. Recommendations include routine testing, better inter-agency coordination, and voluntary blood testing for concerned residents to address this critical public health issue.</p>

While some users report brighter skin and stronger hair/nails, experts like consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth remain skeptical due to challenges in collagen absorption and targeted delivery within the body. Oral collagen peptides face hurdles in the digestive system, and topical creams are deemed ineffective for reaching deeper skin layers. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, but independent research frequently finds no substantial effect, prompting calls for more robust evidence.</p>

          <p>Bali, Indonesia's renowned tropical paradise, is increasingly becoming a victim of its own success, with overtourism leading to disillusionment for many visitors. The island's idealized social media image often clashes with the reality of crowds, traffic, and extensive construction. Recent floods, exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked urban development, highlight the growing strain on the island's infrastructure and environment. While the local government has pledged to restrict new construction, activists and locals emphasize the need for sustainable development and responsible tourism to preserve Bali's cultural richness and natural beauty.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after initial assessments placed China decades behind Europe in science and technology, the Asian nation has significantly flipped the script. This year marks half a century of formal diplomatic relations between China and the European Union, alongside the 25th anniversary of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. Early European observations noted China was at least 20 years behind in modernization, but decades of reform and opening up have propelled China to a leading position in the race for a high-tech future, reshaping global economic dynamics.</p>

Utilizing development corporations, the plan seeks to emulate post-war housing booms to provide homes and essential services for families across England.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing 'full force' if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. Trump cited threats from 'Antifa' and 'domestic terrorists' to justify the move, which has been met with strong opposition from Democratic lawmakers and Oregon's Governor Tina Kotek. Critics argue there is no need for federal troops and accuse the administration of an abuse of power, potentially replaying tactics from 2020. The announcement marks a further expansion of federal intervention in American cities.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a powerful Category 5 storm north of the Caribbean, could potentially interact with another developing tropical system in the western Atlantic, possibly leading to the rare Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two storms merge or orbit a common center. While an unlikely outcome, meteorologists note that if interaction happens, the stronger Humberto would likely absorb the weaker system. Forecasts predict Humberto will remain over open waters, but the second system, named Imelda, could bring heavy rainfall to the Bahamas and southeastern US next week, prompting states like South Carolina to declare emergencies.</p>

China's approach, in contrast, is presented as a potential path towards a more balanced and effective international body, addressing systemic issues that hinder the UN's ability to achieve its core objectives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him 'YOU'RE FIRED!' This public display follows Trump's repeated criticisms of Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, despite the central bank's recent rate cut. While no US president has ever successfully fired a Fed chair, Trump's actions underscore his ongoing efforts to assert control over quasi-independent agencies. Economists and investors fear such a move could undermine the Fed's independence and potentially destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The two-page indictment, signed by a recently sworn-in US attorney and former personal attorney of Trump, appears to be based on a thin case regarding alleged false statements to Congress, which was previously investigated by the inspector general.</p>
