          <h2>Appeals Court Upholds Trump's Authority to Deploy National Guard to Los Angeles Amid Newsom's Challenge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 00:22:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order, allowing President Trump to continue deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they are protecting federal property and immigration agents. The unanimous order from the 9th Circuit is a victory for the president, rejecting Newsom's challenge to the federalization of the California Guard. The court found that Trump likely lawfully exercised his authority under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents, with the panel made up of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee. Newsom expressed disappointment but vowed to continue challenging Trump's use of military soldiers against citizens, while Trump celebrated the decision as a win for his core power to call in the National Guard. The article reflects the legal and political battle over the deployment of federal troops in response to protests. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that political motives drove the U.S. administration's initial blocking of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, leading companies to reconsider investments in the U.S. market. Despite Trump's eventual approval, the deal required Nippon Steel to invest $11 billion by 2028 and grant the U.S. government veto power over key management decisions. Nippon Steel's CEO acknowledged the need for a flexible management strategy due to increased government involvement in business matters. The situation has caused some companies to pause investments due to political and economic uncertainty in Washington, while others are reducing their exposure to the U.S. market.

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential benefits and risks of bombing Iran's Fordo nuclear site, with sources indicating he believes disabling it is necessary due to the risk of weapons production. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision has not been made, pending potential negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear program. The UK Foreign Secretary is actively involved in diplomacy to find a resolution, with meetings planned with Iranian officials in Geneva. Trump is aware of intelligence reports estimating Iran's potential bomb production speed, while some intelligence suggests Iran has not yet restarted research on a delivery mechanism.

          <p>China has permitted Indian pilgrims to visit Tibet after a five-year suspension, prompting calls for this resumption to improve Sino-Indian relations amidst ongoing border tensions. The pilgrimage routes to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar are sacred to multiple religions, with the Indian government organizing the journeys. This year, over 5,500 individuals applied, but only 750 will be permitted to travel between June and August.

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against proposed cuts to disability benefits, expressing her belief that such cuts should not be part of addressing the welfare bill. Foxcroft stated that she had hoped to influence changes from within but ultimately felt unable to do so. The government defends the reforms as necessary to fix a "broken welfare system" and ensure support for those who can and want to work. The proposed bill tightens criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit, potentially facing significant opposition from both Labour and government backbenchers.

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company known for its Labubu dolls, experienced a decline after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its China and Hong Kong focus list.

          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures last month and a trade deal with the U.S. that eased growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. Trade-war fears have diminished after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, enabling rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs. Analysts suggest that the trade truce provides Beijing with some room to support its currency, raising hopes that any economic impact will be less severe than previously anticipated.

          <p>President Trump is considering military action against Iran, specifically targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site, and will make a decision within two weeks. The decision hinges on whether "bunker buster" bombs can effectively destroy the site, which is built deep into a mountain. Israel desires to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities but lacks the necessary resources to damage the secretive Fordow site. The article highlights the key question of whether Trump will join Israel's attacks on Iran and the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of U.S. military options.

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration retains authority over National Guard troops in Los Angeles, while California's legal challenge proceeds. The court found that the president has broad, though not unreviewable, power to deploy the military in American cities. California officials vowed to continue fighting the deployment in federal court, while legal scholars noted the court's shift towards a more balanced stance. The ruling focuses on the limits of presidential power and avoids addressing whether the situation in Los Angeles constitutes a "rebellion". The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Niger's military junta has declared its intention to nationalize Somair, a unit of the French uranium company Orano, amidst escalating tensions between the two nations. The junta cited grievances with Orano's behavior as the reason for the decision, which follows a coup in 2023 that led to a deterioration in relations between Niger and France. Orano, majority-owned by the French state, holds a significant stake in Somair, which operates uranium mines in Niger.
