            <p>President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that interest rates should be lowered to stimulate the economy. Trump's remarks follow increased White House scrutiny of Powell's policies, with economic advisor Kevin Hassett suggesting potential measures to remove Powell from his position. Powell's recent comments about Trump's tariff plans potentially driving up inflation have seemingly fueled the administration's discontent. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that firing Powell would destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An opinion piece discusses President Trump's clash with Harvard University and its implications for higher education funding. The author argues that universities have long benefited from taxpayer support based on the understanding that they contribute to the common good. However, the author contends that many institutions no longer uphold this quid pro quo, citing concerns about cultural Marxist indoctrination and suppression of diverse perspectives. Trump's efforts to condition federal funding on compliance with civil rights laws are seen as a necessary step to recalibrate the taxpayer-university relationship.</p>

            <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs is responding to concerns regarding privacy for telehealth therapy sessions. A memo issued by VA officials emphasizes the need for private workspaces for mental health clinicians to ensure confidential sessions with veterans. This comes after reports of therapists being asked to work in call center-like environments, raising concerns about their ability to guarantee confidentiality. While the memo doesn't explicitly allow therapists to continue working from home, it stipulates that telehealth spaces should offer the same level of privacy as in-person visits.</p>

            <p>Ukraine has imposed sanctions on three Chinese companies accused of involvement in the production of advanced Iskander missiles for Russia. This action follows President Zelensky's claim that China has been supplying weapons to Russia, which China denies. The sanctioned companies are Beijing Aviation And Aerospace Xianghui Technology, Rui Jin Machinery, and Zhongfu Shenying Carbon Fiber Xining. Russia has widely used Iskander missiles in the conflict with Ukraine.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to countries other than their place of origin without due process. The injunction prevents deportations to countries not explicitly mentioned in the removal order without allowing noncitizens to raise safety concerns. The ruling challenges the administration's policy of removing noncitizens to countries like El Salvador or Honduras, even without a removal order to those countries.</p>

            <p>An article discusses the potential revocation of Harvard University's tax-exempt status. The Trump administration is reportedly considering this action, potentially based on the argument that Harvard's activities are contrary to "settled public policy". The author raises concerns about the expansion of the "Bob Jones" case, which allows the IRS to revoke tax exemptions based on public policy considerations. The author argues that conservatives should be wary of granting federal administrators broad discretion to define public interest.</p>
