          <p>China's state media reports that its air force has developed a "kill chain" system enabling older J-10C fighters to shoot down more advanced stealth aircraft. The strategy relies on a network of systems, including airborne warning and control system (AWACS) planes, to detect targets and guide missiles. This development, reportedly used successfully by Pakistan against India, suggests a method for the PLA to counter technologically superior American warplanes by integrating older assets with modern guidance and electronic warfare.</p>

Despite Boeing offering a 20% wage increase and other benefits, the union is holding out for a better deal, impacting a division that constitutes about 30% of the company's revenue.</p>

          <p>Germany's government plans to implement the final stage of its "mother's pension" increase in 2027, a year earlier than scheduled, at an annual cost of €5 billion. The policy provides a pension boost for parents of children born before 1992, aiming to equalize benefits with parents of younger children. However, critics argue the measure is an inefficient approach that doesn't target poverty, benefits older generations at the expense of younger workers, and diverts funds from more critical investments.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK consumers who purchased vehicles using car finance over the last 18 years could be eligible for compensation following a recent Supreme Court ruling. The court found that some lenders paid hidden or excessive commissions to dealers, leading to customers being overcharged for their loans. The Financial Conduct Authority is developing a compensation scheme, with payments expected in 2026, and advises consumers to wait for the official process rather than using claims companies.

Now, over 500 acres, including their fertile farmland, have been allocated for the energy project, leaving the original inhabitants in a fight for either the return of their land or fair compensation.</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, giving the latter its first-ever PCC. Announcing the move alongside leader Nigel Farage, Matthews stated the "dark heart of wokeness" needed to be removed from the justice system. The defection is seen as a blow to the local Conservative party and another sign of Reform UK's growing influence on the right of British politics, adding to its recent local election gains.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 600 retired Israeli security officials, including former heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet, has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump to pressure Israel into ending the war in Gaza. In a letter, they argue that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat and that the focus should be on returning hostages and stopping the suffering. Their plea comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis and stalled ceasefire talks, with the officials stating that the war has ceased to be a "just war."</p>

          <p>While Nvidia is expected to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China after a U.S. export ban was eased, the company faces a tougher competitive landscape. Analysts predict Nvidia's AI chip market share in China will drop significantly as domestic rivals like Huawei gain ground. Furthermore, Nvidia is now facing scrutiny from Beijing, which has summoned the company over national security concerns related to its chips, signaling that regulatory and competitive pressures will challenge its former dominance.
