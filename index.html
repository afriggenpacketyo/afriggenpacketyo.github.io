The article warns that this movement, which often disguises hateful narratives as self-help or lifestyle advice, is creating a socially volatile wave of toxic masculinity.</p>

This article examines the factors that have made the century-old British company vulnerable to a takeover, including the abrupt 2023 departure of CEO Bernard Looney, who had initiated a major pivot to renewable energy. Under new leadership, BP's subsequent strategic shift back towards oil and gas has so far failed to impress investors, fueling takeover rumors. (not investment advice)</p>
