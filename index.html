          <p>Zscaler's stock experienced a significant jump after the company released its third-quarter fiscal results, which exceeded expectations due to growth in artificial intelligence and the adoption of its zero-trust security platform. CEO Jay Chaudhry noted the increasing demand for AI security as businesses integrate AI into their operations, leading to increased investments in this area. The company's revenue grew by 23% to $678 million, surpassing estimates, with adjusted earnings per share also exceeding expectations. These results offer a positive outlook for the cybersecurity industry amidst a volatile macroeconomic environment, though this is (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team achieved a 108-run victory against the West Indies, highlighted by centuries from Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont. The clear gameplan focused on preserving wickets early and accelerating in the final overs, which proved successful against an unthreatening West Indies attack. Jones and Beaumont's opening stand was the highest partnership for any wicket against the West Indies in this format, setting the stage for Sciver-Brunt's explosive performance. This victory demonstrates England's ability to execute a strategic approach as they prepare for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rally in May, gaining over 22%, despite recent reports of poor car sales numbers in China and Europe.

Musk indicated that his time spent running DOGE would decrease significantly, though he plans to continue advising the president, maintaining his office at the White House.

          <p>A recent kidnapping case in New York City, where an Italian tourist was allegedly tortured for his cryptocurrency, highlights a growing trend of "wrench attacks," combining cybertheft with physical violence. These attacks involve criminals using force to obtain crypto account passwords, exploiting the ease of stealing digital wallets compared to traditional bank accounts. The rising value of Bitcoin has made crypto holders lucrative targets, and the flaunting of wealth in the crypto community facilitates identification by criminals. Law enforcement and crypto experts are advising investors to be cautious and take measures to protect their digital assets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump terminated Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing her strong support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as inappropriate for her position. Sajet's past donations to Democratic campaigns and the caption of Trump's portrait in the gallery, which mentioned his impeachments, were also cited as reasons for her dismissal. This action aligns with Trump's broader efforts to eliminate DEI programs from the federal government and remove officials perceived as opposed to his agenda.

          <p>Senate Republicans, led by Senators Eric Schmitt and John Cornyn, are planning a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to investigate former President Joe Biden's cognitive abilities during his time in office. The hearing aims to address concerns about who was running the country during Biden's perceived decline, echoing President Trump's previous criticisms. Cornyn has also requested the Justice Department to investigate potential misrepresentations about Biden's health, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested Jill Biden should testify about her husband's condition.

          <p>World Boxing has announced mandatory sex tests for all fighters in sponsored competitions to ensure fairness and safety, driven by controversies such as the one involving Algerian boxer Imane Khelif. The new policy requires athletes over 18 to undergo a PCR genetic test to determine their assigned sex at birth, with further evaluations for those competing in women's categories if initial results show male chromosomal material. National boxing federations must provide certification of athletes' sex before they can compete, and the policy includes an appeal process. Khelif, who plans to defend her gold medal at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, must undergo a sex test before competing in the Eindhoven Box Cup.</p>
