            <h2>Birmingham Council Progresses in Clearing Waste Backlog Amid Union Dispute</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-15 11:02:31 EDT</div>
          </div>

            <p>Birmingham City Council reports it is on track to clear the backlog of uncollected waste by the weekend, prioritizing the most affected areas despite the ongoing dispute with the Unite union. The strategic director of city operations, Craig Cooper, noted that the amount of uncollected waste had peaked at 22,000 tonnes, and the council aims to resume weekly household collections for all residents soon. The dispute centers around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles, leading to an all-out strike by bin workers since March 11. Amid the standoff, residents have faced piling rubbish, with some volunteering to help clear the waste and express frustrations over the prolonged situation.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Following the government's intervention to seize control of British Steel, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds expressed caution regarding future Chinese investment in the UK steel industry, citing steel as a sensitive sector. This comes after the government passed an emergency law amid concerns that British Steel's Chinese owner, Jingye, planned to shut down blast furnaces. The government had to secure supplies of coking coal and iron ore to keep the Scunthorpe plant operational after Jingye rejected a Â£500m offer in public money. Reynolds indicated the government's intervention was due to Jingye not acting in the UK's national interest, but he also acknowledged potential changes in the plant's employment footprint due to new technology.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>According to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey, President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to incentivize companies to reshore supply chains to the U.S. Most surveyed companies believe that bringing back supply chains could double their costs, leading them to seek lower-tariff countries instead. Over half of the respondents cited cost as the primary deterrent to reshoring, while others pointed to the challenge of finding skilled labor. The survey also revealed that a majority of respondents feel that the Trump administration is bullying corporate America, with many canceling orders and expecting consumers to reduce spending as a result of the tariffs.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has reiterated his stance that Volodymyr Zelensky shares blame for the war with Russia, following a major Russian attack on Sumy that resulted in 35 deaths and 117 injuries. Trump argued that Ukraine should not have initiated a conflict against a much larger adversary and accused Zelensky of always seeking to purchase missiles. He also blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the war's casualties. Trump's comments come after a heated exchange with Zelensky at the White House in February, where he criticized the Ukrainian leader for not pursuing peace talks earlier. </p>

            <p>Former national security advisor John Bolton argues that President Trump's trade policies are strategically flawed, benefiting China by imposing tariffs on allies and undermining potential unified action against Beijing. Bolton criticized the approach as an economic blunder that damages the United States' credibility with its allies. He suggests that a united front with allies would be more effective in influencing China's behavior regarding trade practices. Trump's tariffs, which include a blanket tariff on imported goods and larger levies based on trade deficits, have caused market chaos and strained relationships with key allies.</p>

The attack, in which a man scaled a fence, broke windows, and threw incendiary devices, is the second act of violence against a high-profile politician in Pennsylvania within a year. While researchers have not yet found an uptick in data about political violence, the article argues that every attack on a well-known political figure undermines societal norms. The article suggests that President Trump's rhetoric and actions have contributed to a climate where political violence is more likely.</p>

            <p>A watchdog group, Protect Democracy, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for removing a public tracker of government spending. The lawsuit argues that federal law requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to publicly post apportionment documents to ensure transparency and prevent abuses of power. OMB Director Russell Vought claimed the tracker's removal was necessary to avoid disclosing sensitive information, but the Government Accountability Office disputed this rationale. Congressional Democrats have also criticized the removal, calling it an illegal attempt to hide the administration's spending from the public.</p>

This move contrasts with past Republican opposition to soda regulations, such as New York City's attempt to ban large sodas.

            <p>During a review of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Ratcliffeâs phone to preserve messages from his Signal application, a CIA official was unable to locate any substantive messages, instead finding only administrative content. Hurley Blankenship, CIAâs chief data officer, told a federal judge that he was only able to retrieve "residual administrative content" from Ratcliffe's personal Signal account. This revelation follows concerns raised by an advocacy group about the potential autodeletion of messages on some officialsâ phones, despite federal requirements for communication preservation.</p>

The threat prompted a search of over a thousand staterooms and involved the U.S. Coast Guard and Jamaican authorities.
