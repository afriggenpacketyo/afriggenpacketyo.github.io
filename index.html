          <p>Top advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented President Trump with a plan to establish a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, but the White House has expressed reservations about the proposal. The fund, intended to invest assets from natural resources for public benefit, faces debates over its mechanics and spending priorities. Trump has previously suggested using such a fund to acquire a stake in TikTok, which is facing a potential U.S. ban if ByteDance does not divest.</p>

Protesters had stormed the library, vandalizing property and refusing to identify themselves, leading to the injury of two public safety officers during a crowd surge.

Forensic odontologist Dr. Anas al-Hourani explained that teeth and femurs are being used to determine height, sex, age, and potential torture, but DNA analysis is limited by sanctions and cost.

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates, potentially reducing them to 4.25% from 4.5%, a move that would lower borrowing costs for businesses and individuals but could also reduce returns for savers. Analysts say further rate cuts are likely later in the year, influenced by the rate of price rises in the UK and global economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariff policies. This would be the fourth rate reduction from last year's peak of 5.25%, and the second this year.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to deport immigrants to Libya faces legal challenges, with a US judge blocking the plan due to concerns about violating due process rights. The deportation plan has been criticized due to Libya's history of human rights abuses and the absence of a stable government. Legal experts argue that sending immigrants to Libya would violate both US and international law, particularly the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits sending individuals to places where they would face persecution and danger.</p>

          <p>With tariffs on China climbing to 145 percent, businesses must decide whether to pass the cost to consumers. Some, like Jolie Skin Co, are transparently adding a ‚ÄúTrump liberation tariff‚Äù line, while others, such as Nintendo and Microsoft, are vaguely citing ‚Äúchanges in market conditions.‚Äù This creates a high-wire act for companies, trying to avoid both political backlash and appearing opportunistic. Meanwhile, some businesses are offering ‚Äúpre-tariff‚Äù sales, and Ford is touting its American-made vehicles.</p>
