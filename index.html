          <p>President Trump announced at a U.S. Steel facility in Pennsylvania that he would be doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% in order to further secure the steel industry, claiming that at 25% importers can "sort of get over that fence," but at 50% they cannot. Trump also addressed the Nippon merger, stating that Nippon has committed to keeping U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of ten years with no layoffs or outsourcing. U.S. Steel workers will also receive a $5,000 bonus, and the headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, with Nippon investing $14 billion over 14 months in the company (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Army has issued guidelines for identifying and processing transgender troops for separation, following Defense Department guidance requiring transgender service members to voluntarily leave active duty by June 6. The Army's directives instruct personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth rather than their preferred pronouns. Soldiers are expected to identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria based on criteria such as requests for grooming standard exemptions or overt conduct differing from assigned sex at birth. Critics argue the policy is worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," as it actively seeks out transgender service members.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until she undergoes newly mandated genetic sex testing. World Boxing is introducing mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers after concerns arose from Khelif's potential participation in an upcoming event. This decision follows scrutiny after Khelif won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, with past issues stemming from the International Boxing Association, which has been permanently banned from the Olympics.</p>
