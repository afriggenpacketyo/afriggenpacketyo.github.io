          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo following a period of poor performance. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53 and highlighting their ongoing offensive struggles. Principal owner Mark D. Lerner stated that while the organization is grateful for their past contributions, including the 2019 World Series win, a "fresh approach and new energy" is needed to meet expectations. The team has appointed an interim GM and will announce an interim manager shortly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to restart in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli airstrikes continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent strikes killed at least 38 Palestinians, according to hospital officials, while Israel's military reported hitting over 100 targets in the last day. The talks are centered on a U.S.-led proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release for increased humanitarian aid. However, significant disagreements persist, with Hamas demanding a permanent end to the war and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisting on the complete elimination of Hamas's capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in several Yemeni ports, including Hudaydah, Ras Isa, and Saif. The attacks, which followed evacuation warnings for civilians, targeted sites Israel claims are used to transfer weapons from Iran. Among the targets were a power station and the Galaxy Leader, a commercial ship hijacked by the Houthis in 2023. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz stated the strikes were a response to the Iran-backed group's repeated attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, warning the Houthis will "pay a heavy price."</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to at least 81 fatalities, with 68 deaths in Kerr County alone, and more than 40 people are still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, heavily impacting areas like Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp where multiple campers and a counselor are unaccounted for. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County as extensive search and rescue operations continue around the clock. Officials have described the damage as "horrendously ravaged" and are urging the public for any information on those believed to be lost.</p>

          <p>Despite holding a strong record and a comfortable lead in the National League West, the Los Angeles Dodgers' recent series loss to the Houston Astros has exposed some potential vulnerabilities. The team was outscored 29-6 in a three-game sweep, marking their first such losing streak since May and dropping their record against winning teams to just over .500. Compounding these on-field struggles is a growing injury list, with key players like Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman facing potential time off.

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, an analysis reveals a transformed but still challenged UK counter-terrorism landscape. The attacks exposed significant intelligence failures and led to major reforms, including closer MI5-police collaboration, new legislation, and a regional focus. However, the threat has become more complex, shifting from organized groups like al-Qaeda to self-radicalized individuals and far-right extremists inspired by online content. While the state possesses more sophisticated tools, the rise of DIY, rapid-onset violence means the question of whether the UK is truly safer remains a subject of intense debate.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," following a public falling-out with President Donald Trump. Musk, a vocal critic of a recent Trump-backed spending bill, positioned the party as an alternative to what he calls a "one-party system." President Trump responded by calling the move "ridiculous" and suggesting it would only create confusion within the established two-party system. The announcement marks a significant escalation in the feud between the two and raises questions about the viability of a third-party challenge in U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard's most elite rescuers, known as surfmen, train in one of America's most dangerous inlets, where the Columbia River collides with the Pacific Ocean. This area, dubbed the "Graveyard of the Pacific," provides the consistently hazardous conditions needed to prepare for the toughest rescue missions in 20-foot waves and 50-knot winds. Becoming a surfman is highly exclusive, with only about 130 active members in the entire Coast Guard. The rigorous training program pushes candidates to their limits, teaching them to master their 47-foot motor lifeboats in extreme surf.</p>

          <p>During the Gemini III mission in 1965, astronaut John Young made history by smuggling the first unapproved food into space: a corned beef sandwich. Young secretly brought the sandwich on board for his commander, Gus Grissom, who took a few bites before stowing it away. The incident, which later resulted in disciplinary action from NASA, highlighted the critical importance of food safety in space. Certain foods, particularly those that create crumbs like bread, are banned because floating particles can pose a danger to astronauts' eyes and sensitive equipment in a zero-gravity environment.</p>

Today, however, the agreement is highly sensitive due to rising geopolitical tensions, national security concerns, and techno-nationalism. The very openness that once defined its success is now viewed by some as a vulnerability, making its future a key indicator of US-China engagement.</p>

          <p>In 2007, long before his presidency, Donald Trump launched Trump Steaks, a mail-order business selling premium beef cuts, burgers, and hot dogs. The products, certified as USDA Prime, were sold exclusively through the Sharper Image catalog and the QVC shopping channel. Despite the high-end branding, the company failed after just two months due to extremely low sales. Reviews from the time indicate that consumers were disappointed by the products' bland taste and grainy texture, feeling they did not justify the high price point.
