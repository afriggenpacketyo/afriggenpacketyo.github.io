            <p>President Trump's new tariffs, including a 104% levy on Chinese goods, have come into effect, intensifying global trade war concerns. The move has rattled financial markets, with Asian markets declining and U.S. stock futures signaling further losses. The White House suggests the tariffs aim to initiate trade negotiations, but China has vowed to retaliate. Experts warn of potential inflation and economic slowdown due to these tariffs, which are designed to revive America's manufacturing base. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Gold prices have experienced volatility due to the ongoing tariff war between the U.S. and China, but analysts believe it remains a safe-haven asset. The spot price of gold initially surged but later declined due to short-term sell-offs by traders covering losses in other asset classes. Analysts suggest gold could be used to mitigate losses during market downturns, as it's an easily liquidated asset. Trump's tariffs have triggered a steep downturn in global financial markets, causing significant declines in major indices. (not investment advice)</p>

The tariffs pose a political threat to Cambodia, where the garment sector, a crucial social safety net, is likely to suffer job losses. While China has retaliated with its own levies, Southeast Asian governments are seeking negotiations and offering to reduce tariffs on U.S. imports.</p>

            <p>A survey commissioned by BBC News indicates that over a third of secondary teachers reported misogynistic behavior from pupils in the past week. Approximately 40% of teachers feel unprepared to address such conduct. Concerns are rising about children's exposure to misogynistic and violent content online. Schools are implementing measures to combat derogatory language and address safeguarding issues early, but more guidance is needed.</p>

            <p>Despite President Trump's efforts, the US and Iran remain far apart ahead of planned nuclear talks. Trump is pushing for a deal to prevent Iran from seeking nuclear weapons, a goal Iran denies pursuing. The US has reimposed sanctions after withdrawing from the 2015 JCPOA agreement, leading Iran to increase uranium enrichment. The US is applying economic pressure and threatening military action if a deal is not reached.</p>

            <p>Britain needs to diversify its alliances beyond the U.S. due to the unreliability of the relationship under President Trump. Trump's approach to trade, characterized by punitive tariffs, undermines the concept of a cooperative alliance. While caution is necessary, Britain should not delude itself into thinking Trump's America is the same as its traditional ally. Britain needs to find allies who understand the meaning of the word.</p>

            <p>The major cocaine route to Europe is expanding, with Ecuador becoming a key transit point despite not producing the drug itself. The Albanian mafia controls much of the cocaine flow from South America to Europe, using Ecuador's ports for smuggling. Rising cocaine consumption in Europe fuels the trade, with gangs using various methods to smuggle drugs into shipments. The consequences are deadly, with rising violence and ordinary workers caught in the supply chain.</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs, initiated on April 2, have sent shockwaves through global markets. The plan includes a 10% baseline tariff on most foreign imports, with specific reciprocal tariffs on countries deemed "worst offenders". China faces a total tariff of 104% on goods imported into the U.S. Canada and Mexico are exempt from the baseline rate. The measures aim to address trade imbalances and protect American jobs and manufacturing.</p>

Analysts suggest the conflict could extend beyond trade to technology, investment, and geopolitics. Trump has claimed talks with Beijing about "requested meetings" will be "terminated." Some experts believe a deal is unlikely unless both countries experience significant domestic economic pain. (not investment advice)</p>

The tariffs are seen as a bigger crisis for the country than the COVID-19 pandemic due to the uncertainty they create.</p>
