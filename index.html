          <p>Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty announced that Vance Boelter will face first-degree murder charges for the shooting deaths of Democratic assemblywoman Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as the shooting of Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. Federal prosecutors have also charged Boelter with multiple federal counts, including stalking, murder, and firearms offenses. Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson described the details of the crime as "chilling," noting that Boelter meticulously planned his attacks, researching his victims and conducting surveillance on their homes. The arrest followed a 43-hour manhunt, and doorbell camera footage showed Boelter impersonating a police officer to gain access to the victims' homes.</p>

          <p>All 50 states, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler families, resolving litigation over the opioid crisis. The settlement ends the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and bars them from making, selling, or marketing opioids in the U.S. The funds will support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs over the next 15 years, with a significant amount distributed in the first three years.

          <p>Vance Boelter, charged with the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, also visited the homes of other elected officials the night he killed Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounded Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. The FBI revealed that Boelter went to a state representative's home in Maple Grove, but she was on vacation, and then to a state senator's home in New Hope, where a police officer found Boelter's vehicle but he fled before more officers arrived. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty intends to pursue first-degree murder charges against Boelter, emphasizing the need to address political violence. The criminal complaint details how Boelter, disguised as a police officer, shot the Hoffmans and later killed the Hortmans after police arrived.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump is failing the "tyrant test" by using military force to suppress political opposition, drawing parallels to historical definitions of tyranny. The author contends that Trump's administration has targeted undocumented immigrants and deployed the National Guard to intimidate protesters in California. The article highlights the administration's rhetoric, which paints multicultural communities as a threat and justifies the use of military force against them. It concludes by questioning whether those serving in uniform intended to become instruments of tyranny against their own communities.</p>

Payday lenders often charge a flat fee per $100 borrowed, which can result in an APR close to 400%. The article warns against rolling over loans, as it leads to accumulating more fees without reducing the principal.

          <p>A review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales highlights flaws in data collection, making it impossible to assess the scale of the issue. The report cites a lack of reliable data on the ethnicity of perpetrators, describing it as a "major failing." It recommends a full national inquiry into child sexual exploitation and tightening laws so adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault. The report also calls for closing loopholes in taxi licensing to protect children.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a warning about ticks due to the current hot weather. Ticks are small, spider-like creatures that feed on blood and can transmit infections like Lyme disease. If bitten, remove the tick promptly with tweezers or a tick removal device, clean the area, and watch for a bullseye rash. Seek medical advice if you feel unwell or develop flu-like symptoms after a bite.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission, consisting of two spacecraft flying in precise formation, created an artificial solar eclipse to observe the sun's corona. The mission aims to improve scientific understanding of solar weather, such as coronal mass ejections and solar storms. The spacecraft fly autonomously, using star trackers and GPS for positioning. This allows for observations of the solar corona closer to the solar rim than previously possible.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army's 250th birthday parade in Washington, D.C., was a family-friendly event with a historical narrative. The parade showcased the Army's history, from the early days of revolution to modern technology, with a tone reminiscent of the National Museum of the United States Army. The event contrasted with concerns about the politicization of the military, particularly after a speech by President Trump at Fort Bragg. The parade emphasized service, sacrifice, and duty, presenting a display of civics rather than power.</p>

          <p>The Women's Super League (WSL) is expanding from 12 to 14 teams starting in the 2026-27 season. This change was presented at a shareholders' meeting by WSL Football, which assumed control of the top two tiers from the Football Association in August 2024. To achieve this expansion, the upcoming season will see changes to promotion and relegation, including automatic promotion for the WSL 2 champion and runners-up, and a play-off match. From 2026-27 onwards, there will be one automatic promotion spot for the winner of WSL 2, with the bottom team in the WSL relegated, and a play-off between the second-bottom team of the WSL and the runners-up in WSL 2.</p>
