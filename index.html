          <p>Hurricane Humberto, though weakening, is expected to generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast, as well as in the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, and Bermuda over the next several days. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm, now a Category 2, was moving away from the U.S. but its effects will still be felt from a distance. Humberto had previously reached Category 5 strength before gradually losing intensity. Forecasters are also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda, which is tracking toward Bermuda and is expected to become a hurricane soon, adding to the hazardous ocean conditions in the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Thousands have taken to the streets in Buenos Aires to protest the brutal murders of two women and a teenage girl, whose torture and killings were reportedly livestreamed on social media. The victims—Morena Verdi, Brenda del Castillo, and Lara Gutierrez—were found buried five days after their disappearance, with investigators linking the crime to drug gangs. The case has shocked Argentina, fueling demands for justice and an end to femicide, with feminist groups organizing marches under banners reading "Our lives are not disposable!" Authorities have made several arrests in connection with the crime, which officials say was broadcast to a private group on Instagram, though the platform's parent company, Meta, disputes this claim.</p>

          <p>Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington is speaking out against the "collective delusion" that equates overwork and burnout with success, drawing from her own personal experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007. She argues that scientific evidence shows people are more effective, creative, and resilient when they prioritize time to recharge and take care of themselves. Huffington acknowledges that while the culture is slowly changing, many young professionals still fear being left behind if they don't constantly work. Through her company, she advocates for adopting "micro steps"—small, incremental changes in daily habits—to build a healthier and ultimately more successful life without sacrificing well-being.</p>

          <p>This article details the rise of Rupert Murdoch, tracing his journey from inheriting a single Australian newspaper to building a global media empire that includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post. Experts describe him as a ruthless businessman who mastered tabloid journalism, using sensationalism to drive circulation while wielding his publications to exert significant political influence, notably supporting figures like Margaret Thatcher.

          <h2>Economists Warn Germany Faces Existential Threat from 'Second China Shock'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's manufacturing-heavy economy, which successfully navigated the first "China Shock" of the early 2000s, is now facing a potentially catastrophic second wave of competition. Unlike the first shock, which involved low-end goods, this new phase sees Chinese companies directly competing with Germany's core industries like automobiles, machinery, and chemicals. Chinese firms, benefiting from long-term strategic planning and state subsidies, have rapidly advanced, particularly in electric vehicles, turning from a major customer into a formidable competitor. Economists warn this could lead to a severe deindustrialization in Germany, as its export-led model struggles against cheaper, high-quality Chinese products in global markets.

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The 20-point proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and an increased flow of humanitarian aid. Governance of Gaza would be transferred to an interim administration of Palestinian technocrats overseen by an international board chaired by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The plan has received swift support from several key Arab nations and positive reactions from European leaders, signaling a significant diplomatic push to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a surge in attacks on its critical infrastructure, including cyberattacks, drone incursions over airports, and railway sabotage, raising serious national security concerns. Officials have pointed to state actors like Russia and China, as well as domestic left-wing extremists, as potential perpetrators behind these destabilizing incidents. The German government has acknowledged the gravity of the situation, with the domestic intelligence service reporting near-daily cyberattacks and security experts warning of Russia's increasing use of reconnaissance and armed drones. This multi-pronged threat has prompted calls for stronger government action and has heightened public anxiety over the nation's preparedness to defend against such hybrid attacks.</p>

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned the move as an "attack on neighborhoods" and threatened legal action if troops are sent to Chicago.

The cuts, part of a spending bill signed by President Donald Trump, will take effect on September 30, creating what one nonprofit leader called a "catastrophic situation for public health nutrition." For decades, SNAP-Ed has funded initiatives like cooking classes and school gardens for low-income communities, reaching over 1.8 million people in 2022.

For years, Taiwan has considered its global dominance in advanced semiconductor manufacturing as a security guarantee, compelling the U.S. and other nations to protect it from potential aggression by China. However, the official, Lutnick, framed this concentration of chip production not as a shield for Taiwan, but as a significant vulnerability for the United States. He emphasized the U.S. administration's objective to onshore a significant portion of chip manufacturing, signaling a potential shift in strategic thinking that could undermine Taiwan's defense posture.</p>

However, she alleges that because a fetal heartbeat was detected, the hospitals refused to provide care, violating state law and leading to her developing sepsis during the second incident. The lawsuit argues that the hospital network prioritized its religious directives over her health and safety, seeking damages and an order requiring compliance with state emergency services law.</p>

          <p>The 1990s Irish boyband Boyzone has announced a one-off "final farewell" concert, set to take place at London's Emirates Stadium on June 6, 2026. Titled "One For The Road," the event will be the group's first and biggest stadium performance of their career. Singer Ronan Keating clarified that this is not a reunion or a tour with new music, but rather a final celebration for fans. The announcement follows a positive public reaction to their recent documentary and will be their first performance together since 2019. The band plans to play all their hits and acknowledged it will be emotional to perform without their late bandmate, Stephen Gately.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is gathering strength in the Atlantic and is forecast to become a hurricane as it moves away from the Bahamas and takes a path toward Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane watch for Bermuda, anticipating that the storm will approach the island by late Wednesday. As of early Tuesday, Imelda's maximum sustained winds were just shy of hurricane force. The storm is also contributing to dangerous ocean conditions, with swells affecting the Bahamas and spreading to the U.S. East Coast, creating a risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>

The attack hit a residential building in the village of Chernechchyna, leaving no survivors in the home. This incident is part of a continued pattern of deadly Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas. Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that a reparation loan for Ukraine, funded by frozen Russian assets, would partly support the EU's defense industry. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also reported that recent counteroffensives have successfully liberated significant territory from Russian forces in the east.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for discretionary spending, forcing nonessential federal agencies and programs to close. While essential services like the military, air traffic control, and law enforcement continue to operate, employees in these roles must work without pay until funding is restored. Mandatory spending programs such as Social Security and Medicare are unaffected. During a shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed, national parks and museums may close, and the release of important economic data is delayed. Though most economic impacts are temporary, prolonged shutdowns can cause significant disruption and lasting financial losses.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza represents the most serious effort yet to end the war, calling for an immediate halt to fighting and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel would release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners. The plan outlines a transitional governing body for Gaza led by Palestinian technocrats and international experts, with the potential for the Palestinian Authority to eventually assume control after reforms. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed it as a security win, Hamas faces intense pressure to accept the deal, which demands its decommissioning. However, significant hurdles remain, including opposition from Israel's far-right.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has pleaded guilty in a UK court to illegally acquiring cryptocurrency connected to a massive fraud scheme in China. The case led to what is believed to be the world's largest single seizure of cryptocurrency, with London's Metropolitan Police recovering 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a scam that defrauded more than 128,000 investors in China before she fled the country and attempted to launder the stolen funds in the UK. The conviction is the result of a complex, seven-year international investigation into the global money laundering operation.</p>

The model introduces a feature called DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which allows the AI to handle large amounts of information by focusing only on the most relevant data for a given task, cutting operational costs in half compared to its predecessor. This innovation could make powerful AI more accessible for smaller companies and researchers. However, questions remain about the reliability and safety of sparse attention architecture, as the process of excluding data could potentially remove important nuances and introduce biases.</p>

          <p>As a U.S. government shutdown appears increasingly likely, economists are analyzing its potential impact on a fragile economy already facing a hiring slowdown and persistent inflation. While a short shutdown typically causes only modest damage, primarily from furloughed federal workers reducing consumer spending, a prolonged one could be more significant this time. Experts warn that a shutdown would halt the release of key economic data, such as the monthly jobs report, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to navigate monetary policy. Each week of a shutdown is estimated to reduce annualized GDP growth by about 0.1%, with potential declines in consumer sentiment further straining the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The case centers on a Louisiana woman who claims she was coerced into taking the pills, which were ordered via a telehealth consultation.

Benefit programs like Social Security would continue, but services like the WIC nutrition program could run out of funds quickly. National parks face an uncertain future, and while mail delivery will not be affected, passport processing could see delays.
