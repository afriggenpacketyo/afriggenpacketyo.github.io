          <p>Toyota's global sales for April experienced a 10% increase year-on-year, according to Kyodo News. This growth occurs amidst concerns about the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The sales figures indicate continued consumer demand for Toyota vehicles worldwide. The increase may reflect efforts to bolster sales before the tariffs take effect, but the long-term effects of these tariffs on Toyota's profitability and market share remain uncertain.

          <p>More than 17,000 people are being evacuated in Manitoba, Canada, due to widespread wildfires, prompting a province-wide state of emergency. Premier Wab Kinew has requested military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney to aid in both evacuation and firefighting efforts. The evacuations include the town of Flin Flon and several remote Indigenous communities, with most evacuees being transported to Winnipeg. This event marks the largest evacuation in Manitoba's recent history, highlighting the severity of the current wildfire season across Canada, including Alberta, where oil and gas production has been temporarily shut down.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in "critical fields." The State Department is revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China, including Hong Kong. This move has sparked anxiety across university campuses in the U.S. and is likely to lead to reprisal from China, the country of origin for the second-largest group of international students in the United States. The action coincides with heightened tensions between the United States and China over trade and technology, potentially impacting American universities that rely on international students.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which were unilaterally imposed on numerous countries in April. The court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to levy universal duties on imports without congressional approval. This decision deals a blow to Trump's economic agenda and trade negotiations, although the administration has immediately appealed the ruling. Several existing tariffs on specific products like aluminum and steel remain unaffected, as they were not justified under IEEPA powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is weighing sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to the worsening situation for civilians in Gaza. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government has been mulling these sanctions for months, but the recent shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some officials to pause. Britain is likely to wait and see if Israel will allow more aid into Gaza before making a decision. The two ministers staunchly support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s expanded operations against Hamas, which have resulted in numerous civilian deaths.</p>

The Slovak government has acknowledged the existence of segregation and introduced reforms, but these measures often reinforce segregation.

According to Trump, Harvard has no one but itself to blame for the administration's actions because the university is fighting back. This framing illustrates Trump's tendency to view conflict as a zero-sum game, where he cannot win without someone else losing. Making an example of institutions and people that push back against him has been paramount since he regained the White House.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. will "aggressively" revoke visas from Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in "critical fields." This move is intended to curtail the number of international students in the U.S. and enhance scrutiny for future applicants. Depending on the definition of "critical fields," the edict could affect many of the approximately 280,000 Chinese students in the U.S. The newest move will likely further strain bilateral relations and negatively impact the American higher education system.</p>

However, the remaining intelligence agencies disagree with the F.B.I.’s analysis, creating a dispute over President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport accused gang members without due process.</p>

The new limits are pushing the world’s largest economies closer to supply chain warfare as Washington and Beijing try to flex their power over essential economic components.
