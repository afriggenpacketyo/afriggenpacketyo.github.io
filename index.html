          <p>Following protests in Los Angeles and New York over immigration enforcement, the FBI has made multiple arrests, according to Deputy Director Dan Bongino. Bongino stated that the FBI will continue its illegal immigration operations and prosecute anyone using violence to obstruct or impede them. FBI Director Kash Patel warned that violence against law enforcement would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, regardless of origin or movement. The Department of Homeland Security echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that violent rioters are fighting against law and order, as the FBI continues to make arrests and bring charges in both Los Angeles and New York.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told ABC News that Ukraine is ready for a ceasefire brokered by the United States, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of aiming for the "total defeat" of Ukraine. Zelenskyy stated that Putin is uninterested in peace and that only "hard pressure" led by the U.S. and joined by European allies would render Putin to be "pragmatic" in his thinking. He endorsed an unconditional ceasefire, suggesting diplomacy will run through the White House, while also rejecting President Trump's characterization of the war as "two young children fighting like crazy." Zelenskyy has called for US sanctions and intermediaries to bring about a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has urged the police to "do their bit" to "embrace change" as the Home Office and Treasury negotiate this week's Spending Review. Kyle indicated that while spending would increase for schools and scientific research, police funding may face a squeeze. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp expressed concern about potential police number cuts, while Kyle highlighted the government's existing £1 billion investment in the police. Kyle stated that money is part of how the country changes for the better, and reform, modernization, and technology are the other part.</p>

          <p>ABC News has suspended senior national correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a late-night message on X, which has since been deleted, calling Trump administration official Stephen Miller a “world class hater.” The network stated that Moran's post violated their standards for objectivity and impartiality. Top Trump administration officials, including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Vice President JD Vance, criticized the post and called for accountability and an apology. Moran's post appeared hours after Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests.</p>
