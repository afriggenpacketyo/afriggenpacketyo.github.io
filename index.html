Key U.S. exports to China include oilseeds and grains, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. The escalating trade war could significantly impact American industries and jobs.

            <p>A new study suggests that Los Angeles' Measure ULA, or “mansion tax,” is likely contributing to a decline in apartment construction, potentially worsening the city's housing crisis. The measure, which imposes a tax on property sales over $5 million, has made it more difficult for developers to profit from new housing projects, leading to fewer sales. Researchers estimate that ULA is causing a reduction of at least 1,910 units per year, including affordable units. Proponents argue that the tax has raised millions for affordable housing initiatives.</p>

The author criticizes the extensive use of sanctions by the US and UK, arguing they have failed to achieve desired outcomes in countries like Russia, Iran, and Cuba, and often serve as a mere signal of virtue by western politicians.
