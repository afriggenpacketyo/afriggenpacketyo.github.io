          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China are posing a significant threat to Chinese grocery stores and their customers, potentially leading to price increases and reduced availability of essential ingredients. These stores, which are vital for millions of Americans seeking authentic Chinese products, face difficult choices between absorbing costs and losing customers, or raising prices. The tariffs could disproportionately affect lower-income shoppers and alter the cultural landscape of communities reliant on these groceries.

          <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sent text messages to Barnard College employees, asking if they are Jewish or Israeli and whether they have experienced harassment or antisemitism. The survey, part of an investigation into alleged discrimination against Jewish employees, sparked anxiety among recipients who viewed it as intrusive and potentially creating a list of Jewish faculty and staff. Barnard College acknowledged the investigation and defended its compliance with the EEOC's request for employee contact information, emphasizing that participation in the survey is voluntary. The incident has heightened unease on campus and raised concerns about privacy and surveillance. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>Following a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv that killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others, President Trump issued a rare public statement urging Vladimir Putin to "STOP!" The assault, the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since last summer, prompted widespread condemnation. Mr. Zelensky reported that nearly 70 missiles and about 150 attack drones targeted cities across the country, with Kyiv being the hardest hit.

          <p>A federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration, preventing it from withholding funds from "sanctuary cities." The ruling follows a lawsuit filed by San Francisco and other local governments challenging the administration's efforts to limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. The judge cited the likelihood of irreparable harm to the cities and counties, including budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust with their communities. This decision reinforces the legal precedent that sanctuary policies are lawful and that the federal government cannot unconstitutionally withhold funds. Optimism score: 70</p>
