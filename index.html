          <p>At a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prominent figures delivered impassioned speeches to thousands of mourners. Speakers like Tulsi Gabbard emphasized the importance of protecting free speech, while mentor Tucker Carlson described Kirk as fearless and dedicated to his cause. Former White House official Stephen Miller gave a heated address, declaring "We are the storm" and warning political opponents of a powerful movement they had awakened. The event underscored the defiant and galvanized sentiment among Kirk's supporters following his death.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle is strengthening in the Atlantic Ocean and is on the verge of becoming the season's next hurricane. The storm, the seventh of the 2025 season, is projected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, currently posing no direct threat to land with no watches or warnings in effect. However, the National Hurricane Center has issued advisories for the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada. Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions starting Sunday and continuing into next week.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government touts as a significant opportunity for economic growth. The project will bring the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, aiming to increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 390,000. While the airport claims this expansion will create jobs and boost the local economy, the decision faces fierce opposition. Environmental campaigners and local groups have condemned the move, citing concerns over increased noise, traffic, and climate emissions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, a claim that contradicts current medical guidelines. The announcement is also expected to include an initiative to explore the drug leucovorin as a possible treatment for autism. This move follows President Trump's public statement promising a significant announcement on the topic. The medical community widely considers acetaminophen safe for pregnant women, making the administration's expected declaration highly controversial and a challenge to established scientific consensus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant change to its long-standing foreign policy, the United Kingdom has formally recognized a Palestinian state. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the decision, framing it as a necessary step to "keep alive the possibility of peace and a two-state solution" amid the worsening crisis in the Middle East. The move was fiercely criticized by the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a "huge reward to terrorism." The recognition is largely symbolic but represents a major diplomatic development intended to apply pressure and help shape future peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mountain lion, known as F390, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74, leaving her two 14-month-old cubs orphaned.

Researchers with the UC Davis California Carnivores Program have successfully placed a GPS tracking collar on the female cub to monitor her progress. The incident highlights the significant threat that road traffic poses to Southern California's mountain lion population, whose habitats are increasingly fragmented by highways.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 government funding deadline looming, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is publicly urging President Trump to negotiate a bipartisan deal to avert a shutdown. The primary point of contention is the Democrats' demand that any funding bill include an extension of enhanced tax credits from the Affordable Care Act, a provision Republicans are unlikely to support. Both parties are positioning themselves to blame the other if a shutdown occurs, creating a high-stakes political standoff.

          <p>England secured a 2-0 series victory over Ireland in the first-ever T20 series between the two nations, winning the final match by six wickets. After Ireland set a target of 155, England's chase was anchored by Jordan Cox, who scored a crucial 55 runs despite appearing to injure his knee while fielding earlier. England's spin bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, were effective in restricting the Irish batting lineup. The victory in Malahide capped a successful series for the English side under stand-in skipper Jacob Bethell.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a half-mile stretch of Oxford Street, calling it the day "the fight back began to rescue this street." The event is a glimpse into the mayor's broader plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. The proposal has been met with some opposition from local councillors and residents, who raise concerns about accessibility for those with mobility issues and the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is searching for 27-year-old Anmol Bhatia, who is suspected of breaking into his former apartment and beating his ex-roommate's dog to death. The incident, which occurred on September 4, was captured on home surveillance footage. The video reportedly shows a masked man entering the residence and attacking the small dog until it was motionless. Investigators say Bhatia had been kicked out of the apartment several days prior to the break-in and is also believed to have stolen items from the home.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated in an interview that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be part of the investment group working to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. The potential deal is a response to a 2024 law that would ban the popular Chinese-owned app unless it is sold to a U.S. company due to national security concerns. Trump also mentioned that Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell are involved, describing the group as "American patriots." The White House has indicated a deal is progressing, with Americans set to control the board and the app's algorithm.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has strongly rebuked Charles Kushner, the U.S. ambassador to France, calling his recent public criticism a "mistake" and "unacceptable" for a diplomat. Kushner had published a letter accusing the French government of not doing enough to combat antisemitism and linking its foreign policy to violence against Jews in France. Macron argued that such public statements interfere in domestic affairs and violate diplomatic protocol, suggesting that the American taxpayer's money is not being properly used to finance such remarks. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned the ambassador in a formal rebuke.</p>

Meteorologist Chris Gloninger took to social media to correct this misinformation, explaining that while Earth should be in a long-term natural cooling cycle, human activity has reversed this trend. He clarified that the burning of fossil fuels has caused an unprecedented rate of warming over the last 150 years, a sharp spike that is clearly visible on the very graphs Rogan was citing.</p>

          <p>Travelers across Europe are facing a second day of significant disruption after a cyber-attack targeted a widely used check-in and baggage system. The attack on the 'Muse' software, provided by Collins Aerospace, has affected major hubs including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. With the system down, airport staff have been forced to use manual, paper-based methods for check-in and boarding, leading to long queues and hundreds of flight delays. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday departures as there is still no indication when a secure version of the system will be restored.</p>

          <p>The Great Britain and Northern Ireland team concluded the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with a disappointing tally of five medals and, for the first time since 2003, no golds. This result marks the team's joint-lowest medal count since 2005 and places them 21st in the final medal table. The performance was hampered by injuries to key athletes like Josh Kerr and Molly Caudery, as well as several missed opportunities, including a failure to medal in any relay events.
