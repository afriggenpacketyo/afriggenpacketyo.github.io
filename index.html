          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a 33-year-old Louisiana resident, for his alleged involvement in the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. Court documents claim he was part of a paramilitary group that fought alongside Hamas and coordinated an armed group to cross into Israel, with cell phone data placing him near the Kfar Aza kibbutz during the attack. Al-Muhtadi is accused of later entering the U.S. on a fraudulent visa by concealing his alleged terrorist affiliations and firearms training, and he was subsequently arrested in Lafayette, Louisiana.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has taken survivors of a deadly airstrike on a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean into custody, marking the first such instance since a new campaign began. This strike is believed to be the sixth in the region, bringing the total death toll to at least 28 people. The Trump administration justifies the attacks under an "armed conflict" legal authority, but human rights groups like Human Rights Watch have condemned them as extrajudicial executions that violate international law. The legal status of the detained survivors remains unclear.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a transgender athlete's request to dismiss a lawsuit challenging an Idaho law that bars biological males from competing in women's sports, ensuring the case will be heard by the Supreme Court. Former Idaho State University runner Mary Kate Marshall, a defendant in the case, expressed that the ruling provides an opportunity to affirm fair competition for female athletes. The case, Hecox v. Little, originated when a transgender athlete challenged the state law, and it has now become a potential landmark legal battle over the interpretation of Title IX and constitutional rights in sports.</p>

The new program offers the single-dose antiviral treatment for a $50 cash price, a 70% discount from its list price, through partnerships with pharmacies like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs. This initiative is aimed at uninsured or underinsured patients ahead of the flu season, which was particularly severe last year.

          <p>Following a U.S. military strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean, at least two survivors are now in American custody aboard a naval ship. The attack is part of a broader military campaign aimed at pressuring Venezuela's government over alleged drug trafficking. Concurrently, Admiral Avlin Holsey, who oversaw regional military operations, has unexpectedly stepped down from his post, reportedly due to reservations about the ongoing military strategy and lethal strikes. This development coincides with a significant U.S. military buildup in the area, including the deployment of B-52 bombers.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advancing a $250 million, privately financed ballroom construction project at the White House, an effort seen as part of his focus on building a physical legacy. The project has been funded by corporate and individual donors, who were recently recognized at a White House dinner. In response, Democrats are introducing legislation to place restrictions on such projects, including banning donor names on White House structures and prohibiting construction during government shutdowns. The House Oversight Committee has also launched a preliminary probe into the ballroom's financing to scrutinize potential foreign influence or conflicts of interest.</p>

The proposal follows a call between Presidents Putin and Trump regarding the Ukraine war. The project would face immense logistical challenges, including seismic activity and freezing temperatures, far beyond the scope of the Boring Company's previous work.</p>

          <p>Academy Award-winning actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," with bestselling writer Harlan Coben. The novel centers on a talented female surgeon caught in a conspiracy, a character Witherspoon wanted to be defined by her skills rather than her sex appeal, contrasting with female roles in films she saw growing up. Drawing inspiration from her medical family background, the book explores themes of career setbacks and resilience. Witherspoon, who has championed female-centric stories through her production company Hello Sunshine, views this new venture as an exciting creative frontier.</p>

          <p>The New York Republican state committee has suspended its Young Republicans chapter after a leak revealed thousands of pages of racist and offensive messages exchanged by members in a Telegram group. The leaked chats, published by Politico, included messages from the chapter's chair describing the mass sexual assault of Indigenous people as "epic" and another former chair posting "I love Hitler." The fallout has been significant, leading to the firing of implicated individuals from political roles and prompting the Kansas GOP to disband its own youth chapter in response to the revelations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to ask President Trump for long-range Tomahawk missiles and enhanced U.S. intelligence sharing to improve targeting of Russia's energy infrastructure. The U.S. has reportedly already been providing intelligence support for strikes on Russian refineries, which have significantly reduced Moscow's fuel production and export capabilities. This strategy reflects a more aggressive posture from the Trump administration, aiming to cripple Russia's main source of war funding. While Trump has expressed hesitation about depleting U.S. missile stockpiles, the increased intelligence sharing offers a way to boost Ukraine's effectiveness without providing the weapons directly.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive Russian air incursions into NATO airspace have been met with a firm and coordinated response from the alliance, which some officials believe may have backfired on Vladimir Putin. European leaders and security experts note a rare alignment between President Trump and NATO allies on pressuring Russia, fostering a sense of resolve that may counter Putin's attempts to divide them. This unity has led to enhanced defenses on NATO's eastern flank and blunt warnings from diplomats like Poland's Radosław Sikorski. While Trump's long-term commitment to the alliance remains uncertain, the current unified stance is seen as a crucial message of deterrence.</p>

The former undertaker, Robert Bush, has pleaded guilty to fraud in her case, admitting he deceived her and three other women.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump projects an image of a global peacemaker, his domestic policies are actively stoking internal conflict and division. The author points to the deployment of U.S. troops to Democrat-run cities, which is framed not as a crime-fighting measure but as a political act of intimidation intended to provoke opposition. This strategy, combined with using the justice system to target political opponents like John Bolton and instructing the military to view "civil disturbances" as a priority, is seen as dangerously eroding democratic norms.

          <p>Despite the ongoing trade war and escalating tariffs under President Trump, the economies of the United States and China remain deeply intertwined, a relationship some experts term "Chimerica." While the U.S. faces a significant trade deficit, it relies heavily on China for consumer goods and over 80% of its rare-earth minerals, which are critical for technology and defense. In retaliation for U.S. tariffs and chip export controls, Beijing has restricted rare-earth exports and halted purchases of American soybeans, successfully redirecting its exports to other global markets.

Due to a blanket ban on Russian aircraft in EU and U.S. airspace following the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Putin's presidential plane would require special permission, or a derogation, from individual EU and NATO member states to fly over their territory. While Hungary's government has said it would ensure Putin's entry, the flight path would likely need to be circuitous, avoiding countries like Poland and Ukraine. The EU has indicated it would not block a meeting aimed at peace, but the final decision rests with national authorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dutch government's recent seizure of chipmaker Nexperia was motivated by fears that its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, planned to move the firm's manufacturing operations from Europe to a new factory in China. This concern was confirmed by Nexperia's former CEO, who stated that the Ministry of Economic Affairs acted to prevent the loss of one of Europe's largest chip manufacturers. The unprecedented intervention, which involved ousting the company's Chinese CEO on national security grounds, has created significant tension with Beijing and is expected to provoke further diplomatic and economic retaliation from China.</p>

          <p>A landmark international agreement to mandate emissions reductions for the global shipping industry has been abandoned after the United States and Saudi Arabia successfully derailed the final approval talks. The deal, which would have been the first of its kind for any industry, was blocked when Saudi Arabia passed a motion to adjourn the talks for a year, effectively killing the treaty's timeline. The Trump administration had labeled the plan a "green scam" and reportedly threatened other nations with tariffs if they voted in favor, leading to a dramatic collapse that climate advocates and industry groups have condemned as a major setback.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation, will reportedly run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously established an exploratory committee, his decision to run was apparently accelerated by the entry of a progressive candidate into the race. Pelosi, who is 85 and was first elected in 1987, has not yet announced if she will seek another term. If elected, Wiener, a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, would become the first openly gay person to represent San Francisco in Congress.</p>

The turmoil has drawn attention to the rapidly growing private credit market, with regulators like Germany's Bundesbank president and the IMF now expressing concern about potential spillovers from this less-regulated sector into the broader financial system.

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticized as "the wrong decision" a move by authorities in Birmingham to ban fans of Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending an upcoming match against Aston Villa. The ban was recommended by a local safety advisory group and supported by police, who classified the game as "high risk" due to intelligence and previous incidents of violent clashes involving the team's fans. The decision cited unrest in Amsterdam in 2024, where some Maccabi supporters were involved in altercations, which Israeli officials at the time called a "premeditated antisemitic attack."</p>

          <p>This article advises consumers that making payments on a delinquent debt does not automatically protect them from being sued by a debt collector. Unless a formal, written agreement explicitly states that legal action will be withheld, a collector retains the right to file a lawsuit to secure a judgment, which allows for stronger collection methods like wage garnishment. Informal payment plans arranged over the phone may not offer legal protection. To minimize risk, consumers are urged to get all repayment agreements in writing, adhere strictly to the plan, and understand their rights under state and federal law.</p>

          <p>Small businesses across the U.S. are struggling to cope with President Trump's tariffs, which have dramatically increased their import costs and forced them to take on debt, raise prices, and freeze hiring. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less negotiating power and more fragile supply chains, making them particularly vulnerable to the sudden rise in duties. Several business owners reported that price hikes are already leading to softer sales, creating a difficult choice between absorbing losses or risking a decline in customer demand. Economists warn that the struggles of these small businesses could be a leading indicator of broader economic trouble.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is mired in a stalemate, with Democrats citing a profound lack of trust in President Trump as a primary obstacle to forming a bipartisan negotiating group. In past legislative deadlocks, such "gangs" have been instrumental in crafting compromises, but lawmakers say any agreement reached now could be torpedoed by the president, as has happened previously. Democrats are demanding an "ironclad path forward" on their priorities, such as extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, before they will agree to reopen the government. Meanwhile, Republicans insist that no negotiations can occur until a temporary funding bill is passed.</p>

          <p>The culture of bodybuilding is undergoing a significant shift, moving away from the traditional "dirty bulk" method of consuming massive amounts of processed, high-calorie foods to gain mass. Instead, many professional and amateur bodybuilders are embracing a "lean bulk" or "clean bulk," which involves a smaller, healthier caloric surplus to build muscle more slowly and sustainably. This trend is driven by a convergence of modern exercise science, which shows excessive calories are stored as fat, and broader cultural trends that value a chiseled, year-round physique and "clean" eating. However, experts caution that this approach can still involve extreme dieting and contribute to eating disorders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released proposals aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable, but they fall significantly short of the president's campaign promise to make the procedure free. The new plan offers federal guidance for employers to voluntarily provide fertility coverage and secured discounts on some IVF medications, but includes no new mandates or subsidies. The moves are unlikely to provide substantial relief for most patients, as the guidance is non-binding and drug costs are only a fraction of the total expense. The modest proposal disappointed both patient advocates seeking greater access and some religious conservatives who oppose the procedure on ethical grounds.</p>

It advises understanding the different risks associated with various investment types, such as physical bullion versus mining stocks.

The piece emphasizes that even in a booming market, these assets should primarily serve as diversifiers rather than the main drivers of portfolio growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The CNBC Investing Club, which holds DuPont shares, plans to retain its shares in both the parent company and the new Qnity entity post-spinoff.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Senate Democrats are pursuing a politically damaging and irrational strategy by prolonging the government shutdown. The author contends that holding military funding hostage over domestic policy issues like Obamacare subsidies is an astonishingly weak negotiating position for a minority party. The article suggests that Democrats are focusing on unpopular issues like illegal immigration and gender ideology, which alienates mainstream voters and plays into President Trump's hands. The author concludes that the party's leadership is guided by ideology rather than rational political calculation, preventing them from adopting a more centrist and electorally successful approach.</p>
