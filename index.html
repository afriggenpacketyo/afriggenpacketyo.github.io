          <p>A significant Saharan dust plume is traversing the Atlantic Ocean and is anticipated to affect Florida and South Texas. Radar forecasts indicate the dust will arrive in South and Central Florida by Saturday, potentially lingering for several days, with a denser plume expected by mid-next week. The National Weather Service in San Juan reported reduced visibility and hazy skies in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to the dust, and the National Hurricane Center noted that the dry air associated with the dust suppresses storm development. This annual phenomenon, known as the Saharan Air Layer, typically peaks in June and August, with dust outbreaks occurring every few days and impacting allergies and causing eye irritation.</p>

          <p>Racquel "Kelly" Smith, along with two accomplices, has been sentenced to life imprisonment in South Africa for kidnapping and trafficking her six-year-old daughter, Joshlin Smith, who disappeared in February 2024. Despite extensive searches, Joshlin remains missing, though prosecutors alleged she was sold into slavery, a claim not definitively proven during the trial. The sentencing follows an eight-week trial where witnesses made shocking allegations, with Judge Nathan Erasmus emphasizing the trio's lack of remorse and the devastating impact on the community. Police have vowed to continue searching for Joshlin, even beyond South Africa's borders, while the National Prosecuting Authority lauded the conviction for exploitation and slavery.</p>

          <p>The Senate is preparing to consider legislation passed by the House that includes President Trump's agenda, particularly focusing on Medicaid changes. Several GOP senators, including Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, have expressed reservations about the proposed Medicaid provisions, emphasizing the need to protect their states' interests. The House bill introduces work requirements for childless Medicaid recipients and aims to reduce costs by penalizing states that provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care. The legislation also seeks to freeze provider taxes, with some senators viewing this as a potential cost-saving measure that would not negatively impact their constituents.</p>

          <p>Stocks showed mixed performance on Thursday following a federal court's decision to block some of President Trump's tariffs on China and other trade partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a slight decrease, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced gains. The court's ruling invalidated levies on numerous countries, including tariffs aimed at Mexico and Canada, and a general 10% tariff on goods from nearly all countries. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, leaving the future of these tariffs uncertain, as the ruling centered on the president's use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, with the court arguing it does not explicitly permit tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, as part of a series of clemency actions. Hoover, who was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, still faces a 200-year state sentence in Illinois for murder, which the president cannot commute. Trump also pardoned Michael Grimm, a former New York City congressman convicted of felony tax fraud, among at least two dozen other individuals. Hoover, now 74, has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, though authorities allege he continued to lead his gang from prison.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston indicated plans to issue a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's move to revoke Harvard University's certification to host foreign students. Judge Allison D. Burroughs had previously granted Harvard a temporary restraining order, preventing the government from revoking the school's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Harvard's lawsuit argues that the revocation would affect over 7,000 visa holders, comprising more than a quarter of its student body. This legal challenge highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and higher education institutions regarding international student policies.</p>

          <p>Boeing plans to resume airplane deliveries to China next month after a pause due to trade tensions with the Trump administration, according to CEO Kelly Ortberg. Ortberg also downplayed the impact of tariffs on imported components, stating that much of the cost can be recouped when the planes are exported. China had previously paused deliveries, but has now indicated they will resume, which is a positive sign for Boeing's international operations. Boeing, a major U.S. exporter, contributes significantly to reducing the U.S. trade deficit through its airplane production.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), located in New York City, is a federal court specializing in international trade issues, resolving disputes between governments, manufacturers, and trade associations. It struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, deeming them beyond his legal authority. Three judges, including appointees from different administrations, ruled against the tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. The CIT serves as a crucial forum for interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, helping to avoid jurisdictional conflicts among other federal courts.</p>

          <p>A search for a missing 64-year-old man has been suspended in Switzerland after a massive landslide, triggered by a partial glacier collapse, buried approximately 90% of the village of Blatten. The landslide sent mud and rocks down the mountainside, prompting authorities to evacuate the village earlier in the month as a precaution. The regional government reported that a large chunk of the Birch Glacier had broken off, causing the landslide and burying the nearby Lonza River bed, raising concerns about potential flooding.

          <p>Complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the past five years, according to the Housing Ombudsman. The watchdog highlights an "imbalance of power" between tenants and landlords, with issues like asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control, and leaks contributing to a breakdown in trust. Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway warns that without significant changes, England risks a "managed decline" of social housing, potentially leading to "social disquiet." The report calls for a "transformative overhaul" of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a "national tenant body" to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>

          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan and HELOC rates will likely remain stable in June, despite a recent decline in inflation. While the Federal Reserve is considering rate cuts, ongoing economic uncertainty and the potential inflationary effects of tariffs may delay these plans. Home equity loans typically offer fixed rates, while HELOCs have variable rates that adjust monthly based on the prime rate. Although rates are not expected to decrease, they may remain flat, providing homeowners with a relatively stable borrowing environment compared to more volatile options like credit cards.

Other options include launching Section 301 investigations or broadening Section 232 tariffs, already in place for steel, aluminum, and auto imports.
