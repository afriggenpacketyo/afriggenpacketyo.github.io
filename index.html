          <p>Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, marking the second time the budget carrier has sought such measures within twelve months. The move comes after a previous restructuring in March failed to establish a stable financial footing for the company. CEO Dave Davis stated that more significant work is needed to position the airline for the future, acknowledging that the initial bankruptcy focused on debt reduction but did not sufficiently address deeper operational cost issues and other strategic changes.</p>

          <p>Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations across the United States, with test positivity rates doubling over the past two months. This uptick is attributed to factors like the start of the school year and the emergence of new Omicron subvariants such as XFG. Despite the increase, current figures for hospitalizations and positive tests are significantly lower than they were at the same time last year, and health officials anticipate the updated fall vaccines will offer reasonable protection against severe disease.</p>

          <p>In response to a Senate investigation into inappropriate conversations, Meta has announced temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies for teenage users. The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent potentially inappropriate romantic discussions, instead directing teens to expert resources. These modifications, which also limit teens' access to certain educational chatbots, follow a Reuters report and criticism from advocacy groups like Common Sense Media regarding the platform's safety protocols for minors.</p>

          <p>Following encouragement from former President Donald Trump, Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe is reportedly considering calling a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional maps. The proposed redistricting aims to create a more favorable map for Republican candidates, potentially flipping one of the state's two Democratic-held House seats to the GOP. This move is part of a broader effort in several Republican-led states to adjust political boundaries ahead of midterm elections, prompting criticism from Democrats who accuse the party of attempting to rig the rules.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines with new restrictions, changing the previous policy of universal availability. The updated shots are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications, specifically those aged 65 or older and people with underlying health problems. This shift in guidance has raised questions among the public regarding eligibility and access, reminiscent of the early stages of the pandemic vaccine rollout. NPR is currently soliciting questions from the public to be addressed by a medical expert.</p>

          <p>With the 2026 midterm elections approaching, the political landscape for control of the U.S. Senate is beginning to solidify, with Democrats defending 13 seats and Republicans 24. The retirement of several Democratic incumbents has created potential openings for the GOP, while Democrats face a challenging map with few opportunities to flip Republican-held seats. Key battlegrounds are emerging in states like North Carolina, Georgia, and Michigan, where open seats and vulnerable incumbents are expected to lead to expensive and highly contentious campaigns that will determine the chamber's majority.</p>

          <p>A tragic personal story has emerged from the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting, where one of the critically injured victims is the 12-year-old daughter of a pediatric ICU nurse at the treating hospital. The mother had rushed to work to help with the influx of victims from the mass casualty event before realizing her own child's school was the target and that her daughter was among the wounded. The girl, Sophia Forchas, underwent emergency surgery and remains in critical condition, while her younger brother, who was also present during the attack, was physically unharmed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded August with its fourth consecutive monthly gain, with the S&P 500 advancing approximately 2%, although it ended the final week with a slight loss. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the week's downturn. Investors also processed the latest PCE inflation data, which showed persistent price pressures but did not alter expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, a topic of focus as the market heads into a historically challenging month.

Weiss's wife and daughter had also been taken hostage but were released in November 2023, while he was killed defending the kibbutz as his body was taken into Gaza.

          <p>The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has filed a motion to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, arguing that his appointment by the Trump administration is unlawful. The motion contends that the White House used an unprecedented legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term without Senate or judicial confirmation, circumventing congressional limits on temporary appointments. This legal challenge mirrors similar efforts in other states where critics argue the administration is bypassing constitutional processes to keep political allies in powerful prosecutorial roles.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have identified the world's oldest known ankylosaur, a 165-million-year-old dinosaur named Spicomellus, based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco. The findings, published in 'Nature,' reveal an animal with a unique and elaborate defense system, featuring long bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of these 'tank-like' dinosaurs, suggesting their armor was more complex at an earlier stage than previously believed. Researchers have dubbed the creature the "punk rocker" of its time.</p>

Cook is suing the president to block her removal, which she reportedly learned of via a social media post. The Justice Department countered that the president has broad authority to remove federal officials, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over the limits of presidential power and the autonomy of the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has been re-elected in a landslide victory, four years after he says White officials locked him out of town hall and refused to let him serve. The election, the town's first in decades, was held as part of a federal settlement after Braxton sued, challenging the town's history of 'hand-me-down' governance where mayors appointed their successors. His decisive win is being hailed as a significant moment for democratic representation in the small, majority-Black town, which had previously been run by an all-White government.</p>

Whitmer had faced criticism from Republicans for the long delay in calling the election for the 35th Senate District, a traditionally Democratic area that has seen a rightward shift in recent years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cut $5 billion in foreign aid that has already been allocated by Congress for the current fiscal year. The White House is using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a 'pocket rescission' to claw back the funds, which include money for USAID, the State Department, and international peacekeeping operations. This move effectively bypasses the legislative branch's authority over spending and is likely to face legal challenges, with critics from both parties arguing it violates the constitutional separation of powers.</p>

          <p>As a new school year begins, the use of generative AI has become normalized among high school and college students for a wide range of academic tasks. While educators are also adopting the technology for curriculum planning, there is a growing concern that this widespread use is creating a 'pedagogical debt' and eroding critical-thinking skills. This has led to a debate on the future of education, with some advocating for a return to fundamental skills and classical learning, while others push for a more practical, skills-based curriculum that incorporates AI as a productivity tool.</p>
