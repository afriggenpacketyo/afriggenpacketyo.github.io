          <h2>Trump Fails to Sway Republicans on Tax Bill Amid SALT Deduction Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 13:21:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's attempt to persuade House Republicans from blue states to support a tax bill faltered due to disagreements over state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The "SALT Caucus" opposes the bill, arguing it doesn't adequately increase deductions for their constituents, particularly in states like New York and California. The 2017 tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000, which was seen as a political move against Democratic-leaning states. Trump reportedly told the caucus to "Let it go," but the intra-party conflict threatens the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver faces felony charges for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a protest outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges stem from a clash between protesters and police on May 9, where McIver is accused of interfering with the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was also initially charged with trespassing. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and a mischaracterization of events, asserting that ICE agents escalated the situation. The U.S. Attorney's Office announced the charges publicly before they were unsealed, a departure from standard Justice Department procedure.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (and Scotland) may be eligible for compensation of up to Â£70 each following a court ruling that historic fees charged by Mastercard were unfair. The legal case, initiated by Walter Merricks, argued that shoppers were overcharged due to fees levied on transactions between 1992 and 2008. The European Commission had previously ruled in 2007 that Mastercard's fees infringed competition law. Consumers can register online to claim their payout, with any unclaimed funds going to the company that funded the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The FDA has announced new guidelines for approving future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring more rigorous clinical trials for healthy individuals. The agency will now demand clinical trials showing safety and effectiveness before approving boosters for healthy adults and children, unlike the previous practice of relying on antibody response tests. Immunogenicity data will still be accepted for high-risk individuals, including those over 65 or with underlying conditions. This shift comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>President Trump and Vladimir Putin held a two-hour phone conversation, with Trump emphasizing potential trade opportunities between Russia and the United States after the conflict in Ukraine ends. Putin's reaction was more subdued, stating Russia's openness to a peaceful resolution and a possible "memorandum" with Ukraine. Analysts suggest the call centered more on bilateral economic relations than ending the war, potentially undermining support for Ukraine and its allies. Trump's focus on trade over sanctions is seen as a tactic to draw Putin into negotiations, but analysts doubt its effectiveness.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has saved thousands of lives. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Medicaid expansion led to a 21% reduction in mortality among low-income adults and saved 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that loss of Medicaid coverage, particularly the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy, resulted in fewer prescriptions filled and increased mortality rates among dual-eligible individuals. These findings underscore the potential deadly consequences of proposed Medicaid cuts and increased eligibility checks.</p>

A recent agreement between the UK and the EU removes legal barriers to e-gate use post-EES, and discussions with individual EU nations have begun.

Parcels sent to warehouses will face a lower fee of 50 cents. The EU suspects platforms like Shein and Temu of not adequately preventing the sale of products that fail to meet European standards.</p>

The U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, Bill Essayli, argues that the program is necessary to protect Americans from criminal illegal aliens.
