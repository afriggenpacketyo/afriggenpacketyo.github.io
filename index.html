          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session on President Trump's major tax and spending legislation, known as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." Democrats are using procedural tactics, including forcing votes on numerous amendments, to delay the process and put Republicans on the record on controversial issues. GOP leadership is working to secure enough votes to pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, despite a Congressional Budget Office estimate that it would add over $3 trillion to the deficit. The outcome remains uncertain as leaders negotiate with potential holdouts. (not investment advice)</p>

Cheshire Police confirmed that this development is part of a wider corporate manslaughter probe initiated in 2023 and does not impact Letby's existing convictions.

On his social media platform, Trump suggested that without federal subsidies, Musk's businesses would fail and proposed a government review of his ventures. Musk, who previously served in the administration before a public falling out, has been a vocal critic of the bill, labeling it an act of promoting "debt slavery."</p>

          <p>This article contrasts Sweden's rights-based approach to youth healthcare with the system in the United States, where access is not a guaranteed right and is vulnerable to political budget cuts. Experts highlight that the U.S. is the only UN member state not to have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, meaning crucial programs like Medicaid and CHIP can be reduced at any time. This vulnerability is particularly relevant amid the current federal budget debate, which proposes deep cuts to these essential health services for low-income children.</p>

This move, which can be applied retroactively to the start of 2025, is a key part of Beijing's broader strategy to signal economic openness and retain foreign capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A collaborative effort in West Texas has successfully established the world's largest "dark sky reserve," a 15,000-square-mile area dedicated to preserving the natural night sky. Astronomers from the McDonald Observatory, along with conservationists and local communities, have worked to pass lighting ordinances and persuade nearby oil and gas companies to adopt dark-sky-friendly practices. These measures combat light pollution, protecting vital astronomical research, benefiting nocturnal wildlife, and fostering a growing astro-tourism economy in the remote region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major reconciliation bill could have a severe impact on Medicaid, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting the Senate version would cut federal spending by $1 trillion and cause nearly 12 million people to become uninsured by 2034. A central provision imposes new work requirements on many recipients, which experts warn could disproportionately harm older adults who already face significant barriers to employment. Healthcare advocates also fear the deep funding cuts could trigger the closure of numerous rural hospitals. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the core of the reform remains, which will subject new applicants after 2026 to significantly tougher criteria and lower payment rates.
