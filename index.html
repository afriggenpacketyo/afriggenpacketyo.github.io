          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new, landmark target of reducing the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This significant pledge follows intense public anger over the pollution of rivers and coastlines, and comes after official data showed a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, the highest on record. The government's plan also includes measures to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and cut phosphorus pollution, although it coincides with scrutiny of water companies paying large executive bonuses while consumer bills rise to fund infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Former Super Bowl champion Jason Buck, who is Native American, has expressed his desire to enlist Donald Trump's support in reinstating the "Redskins" name for Washington's NFL team. Buck compared the name change to the Commanders to losing a part of his family's history and hopes to appeal to Trump for help, citing the former president's previous comments that changing the name was a mistake. However, current team owner Josh Harris has stated that the organization is moving forward with the Commanders name and is not considering a reversal, embracing the new identity.</p>

          <p>Following a recent heatwave that left the ground parched, the UK is now under yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and thunderstorms, raising the risk of flash floods across many regions. While an earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, the Met Office cautions that the dry ground increases the likelihood of localized flooding and travel disruption. The unsettled weather is expected to continue, with alerts covering parts of England, Scotland, and Wales through the weekend and into Monday.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of Elon Musk's government efficiency team before his promotion. His departure is part of a broader staffing shakeup within Hegseth's office, which has seen other aides fired or reassigned following a scandal involving the sharing of sensitive military plans on a messaging app. In a statement, Fulcher indicated his six-month service was planned and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The lawsuit stems from an article alleging Trump signed a "bawdy" birthday letter for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump has vehemently denied and labeled a "FAKE." The legal action accuses the newspaper of journalistic failures and making false, unsubstantiated claims, though defamation suits by public figures face a high legal standard requiring proof of "actual malice."</p>

          <p>The investigation into a fatal explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility is now linked to explosives recovered from a Santa Monica apartment. The three deputies who were killed in the blast had responded to a call at the apartment the previous day, where a bag of grenades was discovered in a tenant's storage unit. Authorities are now trying to determine if those were the same explosives that detonated, killing Detectives Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn. The apartment building was evacuated as the search for additional materials continues.</p>

          <p>The defense team for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, claims that Manhattan prosecutors illegally obtained his confidential medical records. His lawyers allege the District Attorney's office used a "fraudulent subpoena" to compel Aetna to release the information, violating health privacy laws like HIPAA. Sources from the DA's office contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent additional materials by mistake, which were then deleted.

The US move, enacted by the Trump administration, came after Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic monitor. This escalation follows recent US calls for tariffs on Brazil over the government's treatment of the former far-right leader.</p>

Alongside fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne, Curry's aggressive and relentless play set a physical tone from the start, and he scored a try before being substituted. His dominant display was seen as a definitive answer to recent criticism about his form, with coach Andy Farrell and teammates praising his warrior-like contribution.

Protesters in London, Bristol, Manchester, and other cities were arrested under the Terrorism Act for displaying placards with slogans such as "I support Palestine Action." The ban, which makes it a criminal offense to support the group, was implemented after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft.

DeChambeau, who called the pace in the first two rounds "out of control," advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness and expose those who are consistently slow.</p>

In an era of online dating and shifting sexual norms, the group attempts to connect with their peers by discussing the negative impacts of social media on relationships and self-worth. They frame chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity and foster deeper connections. This article explores their methods and the challenges of promoting a traditional message to a largely secular and sexually liberal generation.</p>
