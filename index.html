          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, her parents shared their relief and focus on returning to normalcy. They praised Karen's strength and determination throughout the two-year ordeal, calling her the "fifth lawyer" due to her active involvement in the case. Read's parents acknowledged that her life would never be the same, expressing sorrow for the O'Keefe family while hoping the truth about John's death will eventually be uncovered. The case garnered significant attention and hurtful commentary, prompting them to advocate for others in need and speak out against misogyny. The juror cited inconsistencies and lack of evidence as reasons for the acquittal, and Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family. </p>

          <p>All charges against Barry Morphew were dismissed without prejudice just before he was to stand trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in May 2020. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the hope of finding Suzanne's body, along with the court's decision to exclude key expert witnesses. Morphew's attorney maintained his innocence, emphasizing the lack of physical evidence connecting him to the alleged crime. The case, filled with bizarre twists and turns, involves a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a secret affair. The search for Suzanne Morphew's body continues, and Barry Morphew later filed a $15 million civil rights lawsuit alleging wrongful arrest and prosecution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, preventing the government from cutting off the school's access to a federal database tracking student visa applications. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard, suggesting the school has acted appropriately during negotiations. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification, citing alleged failures to address campus antisemitism. Harvard sued, arguing it was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda. The ruling allows Harvard to continue enrolling international students while the case moves forward, though tensions remain between the university and the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rhode Island's state House passed legislation banning the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, often referred to as assault weapons. The bill now heads to Governor Dan McKee, who supports such bans, making Rhode Island the eleventh state with some form of prohibition on these firearms. The proposal applies only to sales and manufacturing, not possession, aligning with Washington state's approach. Critics argue that the ban does little to curb mass shootings and punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates call it the weakest assault weapons ban in the country. The Supreme Court may soon consider challenges to assault weapons bans, as some justices have expressed skepticism about their constitutionality.</p>

Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53 percent increase from 2016. The trend, known as "seichi junrei," involves fans visiting real-life settings that inspired popular works. The growing popularity of Japanese content could offset the country's digital trade deficit, though local governments need to address overtourism issues and provide multilingual support.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, charged in connection to the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who gave his wife a "bailout plan."

Investigators found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans, who survived the attack, recounted being awakened by someone impersonating an officer before being shot.

The incident underscores the challenges in China's neighborhood diplomacy as it aims to foster closer regional ties amid competition with the United States.

          <p>Dietitians recommend chia seed pudding as a late-night snack to help lower cholesterol due to its high fiber content and low saturated fat. The soluble fiber in chia seeds can absorb cholesterol in the gut, removing it from the body. The snack is made with almond milk, which is low in saturated fat, and contains plant protein, which is linked to better heart health. Dietitians suggest that a heart-healthy bedtime snack should combine fiber and protein, be easy to digest, and be simple to assemble.</p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after more than three months in detention, following a ruling by a federal judge. The judge deemed Khalil not a flight risk or threat, allowing his release as immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations. The government argued his activism impedes US foreign policy, seeking his deportation. Khalil criticized the Trump administration for targeting him, while the White House maintained Judge Michael Farbiarz lacked jurisdiction to order his release.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he may consider firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing Powell's decision to keep interest rates steady. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. It remains unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to fire Powell before his term ends in 2026. Trump also referred to Powell as a "dumb guy" and a "Trump Hater," arguing that his strong criticism makes it difficult for Powell to lower rates. The Fed's interest rate policies have been a point of contention, with Trump advocating for lower rates to stimulate economic growth.</p>

These incidents have prompted discussions about the importance of filial piety and traditional values in modern Chinese society.

Analysts suggest that the US's difficulties in securing deals indicate weakness, potentially emboldening Chinese negotiators. Chen Zhiwu of the University of Hong Kong believes these signs of desperation from the US side should empower Beijing in upcoming discussions.

These plants are responsible for a significant portion of Michigan's greenhouse gas emissions.

          <p>Scientists are trying to determine the source of strange radio waves detected from below the ice in Antarctica, which appear to defy the laws of physics. The signals were discovered during a search for high-energy cosmic particles called neutrinos. The radio waves, picked up by NASA's ANITA experiment, seemed to have passed through thousands of miles of rock, which should have absorbed them. Follow-up observations have not been able to find the same signals, leaving the origin of the anomalous signals unclear. Researchers are exploring larger, more sensitive detectors to solve the mystery and continue the search for neutrinos.</p>

The pandemic has led to more casual office attire, but it is important to consider what colleagues are wearing to determine if shorts are appropriate.

          <p>Former colleagues and employees have described Reform's Zia Yusuf as a demanding and sometimes difficult person to work for, citing a "Goldman Sachs-like mentality." Gawain Towler, a former press chief, described an abrupt firing and a lack of empathy. Others noted Yusuf's chaotic style and his habit of pushing people to their limits. Some former employees of Velocity Black, a company he founded, have reported similar issues. Yusuf has disputed these characterizations, attributing the negative sentiments to grudges arising from his success as Reform chairman. Despite the criticisms, some praised his vision and ability to raise investment.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile strike in Israel wounded 23 people as the two countries continued exchanging strikes. The attack occurred as European foreign ministers and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi began diplomatic efforts in Geneva. President Trump stated the U.S. is "ready, willing and able" to engage with Iran, but said it would be "very hard right now" to request Israel pause its offensive. Israel carried out strikes on military and nuclear targets in Iran. The week-long conflict has resulted in hundreds of deaths in both countries, and tensions continue to escalate in the region.</p>
