          <h2>BBC Salary Disclosures Obscure True Earnings of Top Stars</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual salary report reveals top earners like Gary Lineker but fails to provide a complete picture of star compensation. Many high-profile presenters and actors are not on the list because they are paid through independent production companies or the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios. This arrangement, intended to maintain a competitive market, means the publicly funded figures do not reflect the full earnings of talent on popular shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" or "The Traitors." The article explains this discrepancy is due to complex funding and production models.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left another critically injured. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and rescued numerous residents from windows, with officials praising the heroic efforts of first responders for preventing further loss of life. The cause of the fire is under investigation but is not believed to be suspicious. The tragedy has prompted discussions about firefighter staffing levels, which a union official claimed were inadequate.</p>

The court heard that Ethan was severely underweight, dehydrated, and had numerous bruises, indicating he was subjected to sustained abuse and cruelty at his grandparents' home in Flintshire.

          <p>Following England's driest start to the year since 1976, the Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in the East and West Midlands. This adds to existing drought declarations in the North West and Yorkshire, as exceptionally low river levels and parched land affect large parts of the country. The declaration signals the potential for water use restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, to be implemented by water companies to manage dwindling supplies.

          <p>At a high-level meeting, China's top leadership has declared a fundamental shift in the country's urban development model, moving away from large-scale expansion towards enhancing existing urban areas. With 67% of its population now urbanized, the new focus will be on optimizing city planning, improving human well-being, and renovating older districts and dilapidated housing. This change reflects an acknowledgment that the era of rapid, sprawling growth is over. The policy shift aims to create a new, more sustainable model for the property sector and improve urban governance.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and other key structures on the park's North Rim. The Dragon Bravo fire, which was initially sparked by lightning, grew rapidly and consumed the iconic lodge, a visitor center, and other buildings, forcing the area to be closed for the remainder of the season. The fire also damaged a water treatment plant, causing a release of chlorine gas that prompted further evacuations of hikers and firefighters from the inner canyon. No injuries have been reported, but the loss of the 1930s-era lodge is a devastating blow to the park.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted citizenship to Daniel Martindale, an American man who, according to Russian state media, spied on Ukrainian military positions. Moscow-installed authorities in occupied Donetsk announced the passport was awarded for his loyalty and for passing important information to Russian special services while living in Ukraine for two years after the 2022 invasion. Martindale was reportedly extracted in a "complex evacuation operation" and has publicly thanked Russia, calling it his home. He had allegedly posed as a missionary in the city of Vuhledar while gathering intelligence for Russia.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Beijing by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that relations between the two countries have "turned around" after years of diplomatic friction. Xi emphasized a commitment to mutual respect and cooperation, a sentiment echoed by Albanese. The six-day trip, which also includes stops in Shanghai and Chengdu, signifies a significant thaw in relations and an effort by Australia to strengthen economic ties. The warming relationship comes as China seeks to bolster ties with key trading partners amid ongoing policy tensions with the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has imposed a 17% tariff on most tomato imports from Mexico, effective immediately. The move follows the U.S. withdrawal from a 2019 agreement that suspended previous anti-dumping duties, with the Commerce Department arguing the pact failed to protect American growers from unfairly low-priced Mexican imports. Since Mexico supplies about 70% of the tomatoes consumed in the U.S., the new duty is expected to raise prices for consumers on products like fresh tomatoes, salsas, and pizza sauces. Mexican officials rejected the dumping accusations, attributing their product's popularity to high quality. (not investment advice)</p>

These groups are employing organized campaigns to pressure sporting bodies into adopting restrictive policies.

The proposal primarily targets $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs, including global health initiatives, and would also eliminate $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The package, which requires only a simple majority, faces resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about the impact on programs like PEPFAR for AIDS relief and on rural public radio stations.

The company's challenges are compounded by intense competition, economic pressures on consumer spending, and backlash from its shifting stances on social issues like DEI and Pride merchandise.

          <p>In this opinion piece, a pastor and divinity school professor argues that churches should refrain from endorsing political candidates, despite a recent IRS rule change allowing them to do so. While acknowledging the historical necessity for the church, particularly the Black church, to address political and moral issues like injustice, he draws a firm line at candidate endorsements. He contends that such actions reduce the church's role, undermine the conscience of congregants, and risk turning houses of worship into politically polarized spaces. The author urges clergy to resist the temptation to use the pulpit for partisan ends.</p>

          <p>This personal essay recounts the author's journey of leaving the conservative evangelical church tradition due to its rigid opposition to same-sex marriage. Raised in the Southern Baptist Convention, the author describes the painful choice between lifelong celibacy and leaving her beloved community, a dilemma framed by the church as a test of faithfulness. Ultimately, she found that her spiritual integrity required her to leave, and in doing so, she discovered a deeper, more affirming Christianity that embraces her sexuality. The author argues that for many LGBTQ Christians, affirming their identity is a sincere religious conviction.</p>
