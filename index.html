        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in the UK will now be encouraged to release the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases under new guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council. This change aims to counter misinformation and increase transparency, particularly in sensitive investigations that attract significant public interest. The move follows several controversial cases where the lack of official information led to widespread speculation and, in one instance, was linked to riots. The guidance reaffirms that verifying immigration status remains the responsibility of the Home Office, not the police.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has released its 2024 human rights reports, revealing scaled-back criticism of countries like El Salvador while increasing scrutiny of allies such as the U.K. and Germany. The revised reports, adjusted to align with administration executive orders, omit sections on LGBTQ+ discrimination and reduce focus on gender-based violence and corruption. Human rights groups have condemned the changes as a politically motivated "erasure" that undermines the reports' credibility and signals a shift in U.S. foreign policy values.</p>

          <p>Around 100 protestors gathered in Charlbury, a village in the Cotswolds, to express their disapproval of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who is vacationing nearby. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, the "Dance against Vance" event featured demonstrators with placards criticizing his political stances, particularly on Ukraine and environmental issues. Residents voiced concerns over the disruption caused by his security detail and the association of their region with his politics. The protest highlights local opposition to the vice president's presence in the typically quiet English countryside.</p>

          <p>The UK car industry is at a crossroads, with production levels for the first half of 2025 hitting their lowest point since 1953, following major factory closures like Vauxhall's Luton plant. Experts warn that the sector, which contributes £22 billion annually to the economy, is approaching a point where a lack of critical mass could cause the entire industrial ecosystem to collapse. Factors including Brexit, high energy and labor costs, and the difficult transition to electric vehicles have created a structural crisis. While some new investments offer hope, many fear it may be too late to reverse the decline. (not investment advice)</p>

In return, the U.S. government will receive a 15% share of the revenue generated from these sales. This unprecedented deal has sparked significant debate among legal experts and lawmakers from both parties, who question its legality under the Constitution's ban on export taxes and raise national security concerns. The White House has confirmed the mechanics of the arrangement are still being finalized by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Pennsylvania has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a high school runner who challenged the policy allowing her to compete against a transgender athlete. The student, Aislin Magalengo, alleged that competing against a transgender girl was a form of sex-based discrimination under Title IX. However, the Obama-appointed judge ruled that the complaint lacked factual allegations of purposeful discrimination and failed to show that female-born students were treated differently than male-born students. The plaintiff's attorney has announced their intention to appeal the decision, stating the issue is fundamentally unfair to female athletes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination has raised alarms due to Antoni's partisan background and his recent suggestion that the BLS could suspend its monthly jobs reports. This follows the president's firing of the previous commissioner after a jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring. Critics fear the move could politicize the traditionally nonpartisan agency and undermine the integrity of crucial U.S. economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous police jobs. The new law requires law enforcement agencies to conduct comprehensive reviews of an applicant's entire employment history, including disciplinary and performance records, before making a job offer.

The National Weather Service issued a flood warning, predicting that the river will crest at a record high level, posing a significant risk to homes near the riverbank.

From Democrats considering partisan gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, to prosecutors weighing the political fallout of charging a former president, those who resist Trump often must choose between upholding principles and taking extraordinary, potentially damaging measures. This dynamic creates perilous precedents, such as unelected officials defying presidential orders or political rivals facing criminal charges.

His comments come ahead of the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, where territorial concessions are expected to be a key topic. Meanwhile, Russian forces have reportedly made a significant advance near the eastern town of Dobropillia, which Zelenskyy acknowledged was an attempt to create a favorable narrative for Russia before the summit. He remains adamant that any peace talks must respect Ukraine's territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>D'Marcus Riggins, a 17-year-old high school basketball player from Sylacauga, Alabama, was shot and killed last Friday evening just days into his senior year. According to his mother, D'Marcus had called her about an hour before the shooting to ask if a friend could come over, and was shot while walking to his car. Police found him with gunshot wounds and performed CPR, but he later died at the hospital. No arrests have been made, and a reward is being offered for information leading to the suspect in this tragic shooting.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, suggesting he should either replace the bank's chief economist or "focus on being a DJ." The president's comments came in response to a research note from Goldman's chief economist, Jan Hatzius, which predicted that American consumers would bear an increasing share of the costs of new tariffs. Trump insisted that tariffs are not causing inflation and are instead bringing "massive amounts of CASH" into the U.S. Treasury. This public rebuke highlights the administration's sensitivity to economic analyses that contradict its policy narratives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to participate in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders on Wednesday. This call will take place just before Trump's in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. The pre-meeting with allies comes after Zelenskyy noted a "signal" from a U.S. envoy that Russia may be ready for a ceasefire, though he remains skeptical of Putin's intentions. The virtual conference appears to be an effort to coordinate with and reassure allies ahead of the high-stakes talks with the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that China's construction of a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra) River, while causing anxiety in downstream nations like India and Bangladesh, could serve as a catalyst for improved water diplomacy. The project, aimed at generating clean energy and boosting regional development, is perceived by neighbors as a strategic move with significant geopolitical implications. Given the existing tensions over transboundary water sharing in South Asia, the author argues that China could use this project to build confidence. This could be achieved by establishing transparent water-sharing mechanisms and engaging in cooperative dialogue with India.</p>

          <p>Approximately 800 National Guard troops have begun deploying in Washington D.C. after President Trump assumed federal control over the city's police force. The president justified the move by labeling the capital a "lawless city," a claim contradicted by recent Department of Justice data showing a significant drop in violent crime. While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser initially called the move "unprecedented," she later stated the city would utilize the extra manpower. The unarmed troops will not have arrest powers but will support local police, a move that has sparked protests and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>In a private town-hall meeting with Census Bureau employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that Congress, not the president, holds the ultimate authority over the national census. His remarks follow President Trump's recent call for a "new" census that would exclude non-citizens from the count used for congressional apportionment. Lutnick also suggested that while undocumented immigrants must be counted, they should be identified as such in the data. This is the first time a top administration official has publicly recognized the legal and constitutional hurdles facing the president's directive to alter the census.</p>

Despite advancing past Viktoria Plzen on aggregate, they lost the second leg 2-1 and relied heavily on goalkeeper Jack Butland and their opponent's poor finishing. Head coach Russell Martin expressed disappointment with his team's sloppiness, noting they conceded an alarming number of shots and struggled to maintain possession. While securing a spot in the next round is a success, the team will need significant improvement to reach the lucrative group stage.</p>

The report, which was delayed for months and restructured, also largely omits previous sections on LGBTQ+ rights and downplays the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Rights groups have criticized the changes as politically motivated, moving away from traditional U.S. promotion of democracy to align with the administration's "America First" foreign policy.

Radford allegedly used his personal weapon to open fire on his coworkers in an office building. He made his first appearance in a military courtroom and will remain in pretrial confinement.

Kelce, whose receiving yardage has declined, clarified that he doesn't regret the opportunities but feels motivated to return to his peak form for his team.
