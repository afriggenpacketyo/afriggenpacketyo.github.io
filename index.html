          <p>A recent Russian missile and drone attack in the Kyiv region has resulted in the deaths of at least seven people and injuries to several others, according to the interior minister. The strikes targeted residential areas, hospitals, and sports infrastructure, with a high-rise building in the capital suffering significant damage and casualties. Kyiv's mayor reported that six of the deceased were located in the high-rise, and 22 others sustained injuries in the city. This attack is part of a series of massive aerial assaults carried out by Russia on Ukrainian cities in recent weeks, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to travel to London to discuss the ongoing conflict. </p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief has voiced his concern and frustration regarding a planned protest in London in support of Palestine Action, an organization recently involved in an incident at RAF Brize Norton. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley described Palestine Action as an "organised extremist criminal group" and expressed shock that the protest is moving forward. Despite the Met's lack of legal power to prevent the protest before the group is officially proscribed, conditions have been imposed to prevent disorder, damage, and serious disruption. Amnesty International UK has voiced concerns that counter-terrorism powers are being used to target protestors, and Baroness Shami Chakrabarti echoed those concerns. </p>

          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy focused on lowering energy costs for businesses, potentially cutting energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK firms. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The plan also includes measures to expedite connections to the energy grid for new factories and projects, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer touting it as a "turning point for Britain's economy." While manufacturers and trade unions have welcomed the strategy, retail and leisure sectors have expressed disappointment at their exclusion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent poll in Germany reveals that nearly two-thirds of Germans support the establishment of a European nuclear deterrent independent of the United States. The survey, conducted by the Forsa institute, indicates that 64% of respondents favor the idea, with support consistent across demographic and political lines. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has previously signaled his intention to discuss a joint European nuclear strategy with the United Kingdom and France. The goal is to reduce Europe's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella, particularly amid concerns about the unpredictability of President Donald Trump, and this poll suggests Germans generally agree with this goal. </p>

Bradley's win moved him up in both the world rankings and the American Ryder Cup qualification standings, opening the door for him to potentially take on a dual role as both captain and player. He stated that he would need to carefully consider what is best for the team, especially given his strong performance and the support of his vice-captains. Arnold Palmer was the last playing captain for the Ryder Cup in 1963, and Bradley acknowledged that the PGA of America had considered the possibility of him being a playing captain when he was first appointed. </p>

He has also pushed for policies like ending birthright citizenship, which Trump has embraced. While critics label Stein an extremist spreading nativist ideas, he sees his work as making up for lost time and is pleased with the current administration's crackdown on immigration, including increased deportations and efforts to end birthright citizenship. </p>

The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture, or sell consumable THC products, representing one of the most restrictive bans in the country. Critics of the bill argued that it would prevent people who cannot access marijuana through the state's limited medical program from obtaining similar relief. Retailers across the state also highlighted the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue generated by the THC consumables industry. </p>

Schoen points to parallels between the Milosevic regime in Serbia and the current Iranian government, noting widespread dissatisfaction with the economy and national policy. He argues that, like in Serbia, foreign airstrikes could weaken the Iranian government and create an opportunity for opposition movements to mobilize. While acknowledging the risks and uncertainties, Schoen believes that the Iranian government is weaker than it appears and that the destruction of its military capabilities could empower those seeking greater freedom and peace. </p>

While unregulated stablecoins could pose risks to China's financial system, forgoing this technology could hinder the yuan's internationalization efforts.

          <p>President Trump's recent decision to order military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites signifies a shift from his role as a showman to a more assertive, strongman figure. Despite campaigning on promises of isolationism and ending foreign wars, Trump ordered a major military intervention in Iran, alarming some of his supporters. The move reflects a disregard for public opinion and a contempt for Congress, as Democrats point out that the action violates the Constitution. While Republicans largely support the strikes, the incident underscores the potential for Trump to exploit external threats to consolidate power and suppress dissent. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to reshape the civil service by changing norms around hiring and firing federal employees. A proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management would allow the administration to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants into a new category of employees who serve at the pleasure of the president. Critics argue that this move politicizes the civil service and could have negative consequences for the American people, potentially leading to a loss of expertise and trustworthiness in government data. The administration claims these changes will improve efficiency and accountability, while opponents fear a return to a level of political sycophancy not seen since the 19th century. </p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's stated intention to send up to 30,000 migrants to GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, the actual number has been significantly lower, around 500. The U.S. has spent over $40 million on holding migrants at GuantÃ¡namo in about the first two months of that operation, not including transportation costs. The average daily cost of holding a migrant at GuantÃ¡namo is approximately $100,000, significantly higher than the $165 a day it costs to detain a migrant in ICE facilities in the U.S. While the government claims GuantÃ¡namo is used for "temporary transit" and "staging for final removal," critics argue the practice is intended to frighten migrants into self-deportation. </p>

Tick risks and the diseases they carry vary by region, with Lyme disease being the most common tick-borne illness in the U.S. The CDC divides the country into three regions regarding tick risks: the North, the South, and the West, each with different prevalent diseases. Experts recommend taking precautions such as performing frequent tick checks, using insect repellents, and staying in the middle of well-maintained trails to reduce the risk of tick bites. </p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced a surge in early trading due to its safe-haven status following U.S. military strikes on Iran, but analysts suggest these gains may be temporary. While the initial rally was driven by fears of Iranian retaliation and potential disruptions to oil supplies, concerns over U.S. fiscal policy and trade wars are expected to regain focus. The dollar index is down more than 8% this year, reflecting long-term concerns about the U.S. economy. Some analysts believe the Middle East conflict is merely masking underlying issues that will resurface once the immediate crisis-driven demand subsides. (not investment advice)</p>

NHS England states that the phased approach will prioritize those most in need while managing GPs' workload and NHS resources. The weekly injection helps patients feel full, reducing food intake and potentially leading to a 20% body weight reduction. Due to workforce constraints, GPs urge the public not to approach their local surgery unless they meet the eligibility requirements, which include a high BMI and multiple health conditions. </p>

          <p>Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transit, carries significant risks for the country, according to experts. While the Iranian parliament has approved the closure, the decision rests with the country's national security council, with the move potentially alienating neighbors and trade partners. Closing the strait could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions, prompting Washington to call on Beijing to prevent the closure. Experts suggest that Iran would have more to lose than gain by blocking the strait, as it relies on the waterway for its own oil exports and risks antagonizing key trading partners like China. </p>
