          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along Texas's Guadalupe River have resulted in at least 109 fatalities, with dozens still missing. The disaster, exacerbated by a combination of a tropical system and local geography, struck a flood-prone region during a holiday weekend, catching many residents and campers by surprise. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the timeliness and adequacy of their emergency warnings, as survivors report receiving no alerts before the deluge. The event has prompted a massive search and rescue operation and a federal disaster declaration.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp in Texas, has confirmed the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors in the recent catastrophic flash floods. With several individuals from the camp still unaccounted for, search and rescue operations are ongoing amid widespread devastation. The camp's owner, Dick Eastland, reportedly died while attempting to save campers from the rapidly rising waters of the Guadalupe River. The tragedy has left the community heartbroken, with authorities also warning families about scams targeting them during this vulnerable time.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced the immediate termination of the mandatory shoe removal policy at standard TSA security checkpoints across all U.S. airports. This change ends a nearly 20-year-old rule that was implemented following the 2001 "shoe bomber" incident. Officials cited significant advancements in security technology as the reason for the policy reversal, noting that a multi-layered security approach remains in place. While this change applies to all travelers, rules for removing liquids, laptops, and coats are still being evaluated.</p>

The author contends that the political resilience of programs for the elderly stems more from their perceived "earned" status and the high voting rates of seniors, not just their universality. The piece argues that while universal programs have policy advantages, creating them faces significant political and fiscal hurdles in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The family of an off-duty San Diego police officer has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Riverside County after he was found dead outside a jail just minutes after being released. Lawrence David Orso had been arrested for DUI and collapsed on a curb after his release. The lawsuit alleges that jail staff were "deliberately indifferent," ignoring his complaints of chest pains and other signs of medical distress, and releasing him while he was still intoxicated. The suit claims the county failed to have proper policies and training that could have prevented his death.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has fueled speculation of a split with NFL star Stefon Diggs after she deleted all photos of him from her Instagram account. The couple had made their relationship public in May and "Instagram official" in June with a series of intimate photos that are now gone. Although the photos have been removed, the two still follow each other on the social media platform. The potential breakup chatter comes as Cardi B prepares for the September release of her highly anticipated sophomore album, "Am I the Drama?," her first since 2018.</p>

          <p>During a cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump suggested the federal government has "tremendous power" to take over the administration of New York City and Washington, D.C. Citing concerns over crime and local leadership, Trump stated his administration is "thinking about" a federal takeover of the nation's capital to ensure it is "run flawlessly." He did not specify the legal authority for such a move but framed it as a way to restore order and proper governance. The comments were made while discussing New York's mayoral election and his dissatisfaction with the candidates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers and restaurants are facing searingly high beef prices, which reached a record $5.98 per pound in May. The primary driver is a classic supply and demand issue: the U.S. cattle herd is at its smallest size since the 1960s, largely due to years of drought that forced ranchers to sell off livestock. Despite the availability of cheaper alternatives like pork and poultry, American demand for beef has remained remarkably strong. Experts predict that prices will continue to rise and remain elevated for the next several years as the industry slowly rebuilds its herds. (not investment advice)</p>

The comments came just days after the Pentagon paused a weapons shipment to Ukraine, a move Trump claimed he was unaware of, before stating the U.S. would now send more weapons. He expressed disappointment with a recent phone call with Putin, believing the Russian leader is not looking to end the war.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that he cannot stop the Trump administration from rescinding millions of dollars in grants to anti-violence non-profits, despite calling the cuts "shameful." The lawsuit was filed by five organizations that lost funding from the Department of Justice, which stated it was refocusing priorities on law enforcement operations. The judge, while sympathetic to the groups, concluded he lacked the authority to issue an injunction to restore the funding. The plaintiffs argued the cuts were arbitrary and would harm communities vulnerable to crime and violence.</p>

          <p>This review praises the new "Superman" movie for its fresh approach, placing the hero in a world already full of super-powered individuals rather than as a lone god. This choice helps define Superman's unique, sincere altruism in contrast to his more jaded peers. Director James Gunn moves away from his signature snark toward a more lighthearted, cartoon-like tone, with David Corenswet playing a relatable, regular-guy version of the hero. The film builds modern skepticism of earnestness into its narrative, creating a brilliant and effective reintroduction to the iconic character for contemporary audiences.</p>

The bill, initially introduced by the previous government, was reintroduced by the new Labour government and hailed by supporters as a historic step for fairness in the sport.

Proponents, like some start-up founders and major tech CEOs, see AI's rapid, transformative advance as inevitable and overwhelmingly positive, dismissing concerns about job loss or other downsides. Conversely, critics dismiss the technology as an overhyped "con" and a "racist pile of linear algebra." This escalating war of rhetoric, fueled by massive financial investment and ubiquitous deployment, is creating two parallel realities, leaving little room for nuanced discussion about AI's real-world impacts.</p>
