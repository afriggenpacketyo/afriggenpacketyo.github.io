            <p>Marvin Roberts, an Alaska Native man, settled with the city of Fairbanks for $11.5 million after spending nearly two decades in prison for a 1997 murder he maintained he did not commit; Roberts and three other Indigenous men, known as the Fairbanks Four, had their convictions vacated in 2015. Roberts alleged racial bias in the police investigation, and this settlement marks the end of his long legal battle. While the city denies liability, the settlement is seen as a vindication of Roberts' innocence, allowing him to move forward and spend time with his family.</p>

            <p>A contributor argues that small modular reactors (SMRs) are not a practical solution for California's energy needs, citing high costs and historical failures. Despite hype from venture capitalists and the Department of Energy, SMRs are deemed less economically viable than larger reactors and more expensive than renewable energy sources like solar and wind. The author points to cost overruns and cancellations of SMR projects, advocating for investment in cheaper and cleaner alternatives like wind, solar, and batteries instead. </p>

            <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has fallen in global rankings of busiest airports due to a drop in domestic travel and slow pandemic recovery. LAX's passenger count decreased, leading to its removal from the top 10 list, despite being a major hub for takeoffs and landings. Airport officials cite factors like consumer confidence, immigration policies, and trade policies as reasons for the decline, prompting revisions to fiscal budgets and infrastructure project priorities. While LAX is undergoing a $30 billion overhaul, the airport is still struggling to regain its pre-pandemic traffic levels.</p>

            <p>Jan-Werner Müller discusses Harvard's resistance to what he views as illegal demands from the Trump administration, arguing that this resistance is a crucial signal that universities can stand up to political overreach. He suggests that universities should collaborate on litigation strategies, public outreach, and lobbying Congress to counter the administration's attempts to control funding and suppress critical thinking. Müller warns against universities making concessions that could undermine academic freedom and enable government intrusion into academic affairs.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is accused of punishing immigrants for following legal procedures, undermining trust in government institutions. Examples include the arrest of a Palestinian student during a naturalization interview and the IRS sharing data on undocumented taxpayers with immigration authorities. These actions create a climate of fear and discourage immigrants from engaging with the government, potentially driving them further into the shadows. The administration's actions are seen as part of a broader effort to reduce immigration and establish a tiered citizenship system.</p>
