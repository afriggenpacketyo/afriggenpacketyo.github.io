          <p>Police in London have arrested numerous demonstrators at a protest in Parliament Square showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. The government proscribed the organization in July, making any display of support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. This event occurred amid a weekend of planned protests by various pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups, prompting a significant police presence in the capital. Over 200 people have been arrested nationwide since the ban was enacted.</p>

Brown labels their alliance as representative of the "extreme left," attempting to tie his own Democratic opponent, Chris Pappas, to their progressive policies. This political strategy aims to portray Democrats as out of touch with New Hampshire voters by linking them to what Brown describes as socialist and extreme ideologies.</p>

          <p>American shopping malls, long considered a dying retail format, are experiencing a surprising resurgence by replacing vacant anchor stores with unconventional tenants like churches, bowling alleys, and large bookstores. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio transformed a former Sears into a thriving church and community hub, driving significant foot traffic. Mall owners are finding that diversifying their offerings with experiential businesses and community spaces increases 'cross-shopping' and appeals to younger generations like Gen Z. This strategy of subdividing large retail spaces is proving successful in revitalizing these once-struggling commercial centers.</p>

          <p>Following former President Trump's announcement of a meeting with Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not cede any territory. Trump suggested that a peace deal might involve "some swapping of territories," a proposal that could legitimize some of Russia's territorial gains. The planned summit in Alaska, the first of its kind since 2021, has sparked concern that Ukraine could be excluded from critical negotiations about its own future.</p>

          <p>The owner of the Trump Burger restaurant chain in Texas, Roland Mehrez Beainy, has been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is facing deportation. Beainy, a Lebanese national, allegedly overstayed his visa after entering the U.S. in 2019. ICE stated that his arrest is part of the administration's commitment to enforcing immigration laws, regardless of an individual's political beliefs or business ventures. This case is one of several instances where vocal supporters of Donald Trump have been targeted for deportation under his administration's stricter immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to roll back protections and expand oil and gas drilling across the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska has drawn significant public outcry. The proposal would open up 82% of the 23-million-acre reserve, threatening critical wildlife habitats, the subsistence rights of Alaska Native communities, and a rapidly warming ecosystem. Conservation groups and Alaska Native leaders have condemned the move as an "erasure of years of work" to protect the region's special areas.

The scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that was likely the true cause of his symptoms.

Officials cited liability concerns and procedural requirements, stating that such installations must be part of a holistic study including curb ramps, lighting, and signals. This incident has become a symbol of the city's bureaucratic inefficiency and inability to execute public projects quickly, drawing comparisons to other major failures in transit and housing. After public pressure, the city did repaint the crosswalks, but the underlying systemic issues remain.</p>

          <p>A Tesla Model 3 owner used Reddit to share footage of a person brazenly slashing their vehicle's tire in broad daylight. The incident is part of a persistent trend of vandalism targeting electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure, which is sometimes attributed to anti-EV sentiment or negative reactions to Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk. Such acts of vandalism not only impose financial and emotional costs on owners but may also deter potential buyers from switching to cleaner transportation. Experts continue to affirm that despite production impacts, EVs are ultimately better for the environment than fossil-fuel-powered cars.</p>

          <p>India is undertaking a major upgrade of the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road, its primary land access to the strategically sensitive Galwan Valley near the Chinese border. The enhancement will allow the road to accommodate tanks and trucks carrying long-range missiles, significantly improving military mobility. Additionally, a 130-kilometer alternative route is nearing completion to reduce reliance on the existing road, which is exposed to Chinese surveillance. This infrastructure development is aimed at speeding up troop movement in case of a confrontation, prompting calls in China for close monitoring of the situation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the administration of former President Joe Biden shares complicity in the starvation crisis in Gaza by failing to act on early warnings and undermining humanitarian efforts. The author contends that despite repeated alerts from the UN and aid groups about an impending famine, the Biden administration continued unconditional military support for Israel and avoided officially concluding that Israel was obstructing aid. The piece highlights several instances where the administration could have used its leverage to prevent the catastrophe but chose not to, staining its legacy.</p>

The author asserts that the FBI's jurisdiction is strictly limited to federal crimes, and getting involved in a civil state matter would be a lawless expansion of its authority. Such an action would transform the agency into a political instrument for the party in power, a dangerous step toward a police state that would severely damage American democracy.</p>

The camp, which symbolized Palestinian identity and resistance, is now a testament to the conflict's devastation.

The piece uses the example of how Democratic gerrymandering in Illinois eliminated the district of moderate Republican Adam Kinzinger, who later became a key figure in the January 6th committee, to illustrate the unpredictable and damaging consequences of this political practice.</p>

The commission previously rejected a smaller increase and is being sued by SpaceX, which argues the state agency is overreaching its authority.

Scientists leading the dig, however, explain that the deliberate pace is necessary to properly preserve and study the delicate, layered site for future generations.

The sudden intake of nutrients can cause a rapid shift in electrolytes, leading to critical organ failure or an irregular heartbeat. Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods like Plumpy'Nut to stabilize patients and prevent this syndrome.
