          <p>Europe's largest lender, HSBC, reported a 29% decline in second-quarter profit to $6.3 billion, missing analyst estimates, but simultaneously announced a $3 billion share buyback. The bank cited structural challenges in the global economy, including broad-based tariffs and fiscal vulnerabilities, which are complicating the inflation and interest rate outlook. Despite potential impacts on its return on tangible equity, HSBC anticipates continued growth in its wealth division and is restructuring its investment banking operations.

          <p>German double Olympic biathlon champion Laura Dahlmeier sustained severe injuries in a mountaineering accident in Pakistan's Karakoram mountains, caught in a rockfall at 5,700 meters. Bad weather initially hampered rescue efforts, but the Pakistan army is now assisting. The 31-year-old, an experienced mountaineer, was climbing with a partner when the incident occurred. A ground rescue mission is underway as helicopter access remains challenging due to the remote location and difficult conditions.</p>

          <p>The Eris rocket, Australia's first domestically designed and manufactured orbital launch vehicle, crashed 14 seconds into its test flight from Queensland. Despite the failure to reach orbit, Gilmour Space Technologies hailed the launch as a success, noting all four hybrid engines ignited and the rocket cleared the launchpad. No injuries were reported, and the launch site remained intact. This attempt marks Australia's first orbital launch in over 50 years, aimed at deploying small satellites.</p>

This decision follows a survey indicating that 37% of minors encountered harmful content on the platform.

The law, slated for implementation in December 2025, carries substantial fines for non-compliance, although YouTube disputes its classification as "social media" and plans further engagement with the government.</p>
