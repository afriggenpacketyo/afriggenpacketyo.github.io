          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million in its first quarterly earnings since going public, causing its stock to rise. The growth was primarily fueled by the strong performance of its USD Coin (USDC), the world's second-largest stablecoin. Despite the revenue jump, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, largely due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, including stock-based compensation and debt value adjustments.

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a "public safety emergency" in Washington D.C., deploying 800 National Guard troops and placing the city's police force under federal control for 30 days. He cited concerns over "lawlessness," crime, and homelessness as justification for the move. However, Mayor Muriel Bowser and crime statistics indicate that violent crime in the city is actually at a 30-year low, and homicides have significantly decreased. The action has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic leaders, who label it an unconstitutional power grab.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25-year study from Northwestern University has explored why "super agers"—individuals over 80 with the memory capacity of people decades younger—maintain their cognitive sharpness. Researchers found these individuals exhibit distinct brain characteristics, including a thicker cortex and more von Economo neurons, which are linked to social behavior. The study suggests two pathways: some brains resist the formation of toxic proteins associated with Alzheimer's, while others show resilience by having these proteins without suffering cognitive effects. This research challenges the assumption that significant memory loss is an inevitable part of aging.</p>

          <p>Workers and labor advocates in Missouri are expressing devastation after the Republican-led legislature and governor repealed a paid sick leave mandate that voters had approved with 58% support. The law, which also included minimum wage increases, was overturned following intense lobbying from business groups. Workers shared personal stories of having to work while ill or forgoing pay to care for sick family members, highlighting the public health and financial consequences. Advocacy groups are now considering a new ballot initiative to enshrine the protections in the state's constitution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics and civil rights groups argue that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force is a pretextual "invitation for abuse" that ignores data showing a 30-year low in violent crime. The move is seen as a political show of force rather than a response to a genuine emergency, raising concerns about police accountability, as federal prosecutors are presidentially appointed. Legal experts suggest this action complicates oversight and could lead to increased police harassment and violence. This development is viewed by local advocates as a powerful argument for D.C. statehood to prevent such federal overreach.</p>

This launch comes as Tesla faces intensified competition and a recent decline in its mainland China deliveries. The company's Shanghai Gigafactory saw an 8.4% year-over-year drop in deliveries for July, reflecting the challenging market dynamics.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation rate dropped to 1.55% in July, marking the ninth consecutive month of decline and reaching its lowest level since June 2017. The decrease was largely driven by falling food prices, with the reading coming in below economists' expectations. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with potential room to loosen monetary policy to support economic growth. The positive inflation outlook contrasts with economic headwinds from U.S. trade tensions, as India faces significant tariffs over its oil purchases from Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

Kallas emphasized that any legitimate peace deal requires the participation of both Ukraine and Europe, and that Putin's exclusion of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy from the talks proves he is only "pretending to negotiate."

Despite these trends, wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, suggesting a gradual slowdown rather than a sharp downturn.

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska brings to light the state's deep historical ties to Russia, which colonized the territory in the 18th century. Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million after the costly Crimean War left its empire financially strained and the region's fur trade had declined. The deal, initially mocked in the U.S. as "Seward's Folly," was seen by Russia as a pragmatic way to raise funds and avoid conflict with Britain. The historical transaction provides a unique backdrop to the modern diplomatic meeting.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: California Should Counter Texas's Partisan Redistricting to Protect Democracy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that if Texas Republicans proceed with a mid-decade congressional redistricting plan to gain seats, California must respond in kind by redrawing its own maps to favor Democrats. The author contends that while such a move is typically undesirable, it is a necessary "tit-for-tat" strategy to prevent a single party from subverting the democratic process for political gain. Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal to do so is framed as a prudent defensive measure to ensure California isn't rendered powerless by another state's political hardball. The piece concludes that maintaining the moral high ground is useless without power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent executive order by President Trump aims to address homelessness by shifting individuals into long-term institutional settings, a policy the author argues is neither new, compassionate, nor evidence-based. The article points to the dark history of mass institutionalization and the subsequent failure to provide adequate community care, leading to jails becoming de facto psychiatric facilities. The author contends that the "housing first" approach, which the order seeks to end, is a more effective and humane solution that has been proven to save money. The order is framed as a cruel measure that criminalizes homelessness.</p>

          <p>Military veterans across the U.S. are experiencing significant delays and errors in receiving their GI Bill education benefits, a problem advocates attribute to staffing cuts at the Veterans Administration. Some student veterans are waiting months for essential funding for tuition, housing, and textbooks, forcing some to drop out of college. College veteran affairs offices report being overwhelmed, spending hours on the phone with the VA to resolve paperwork issues for individual students. Advocacy groups warn that these disruptions are creating immense stress and threatening veterans' access to higher education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is facing a severe shortage of Black recruits, with recent academy classes graduating without a single Black officer. This long-term decline in diversity is being compounded by President Trump's campaign against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which has led to the quiet closure of the LAPD's own DEI program. Black officers' associations express concern that this climate will further hinder recruitment and retention, especially as many senior Black officers approach retirement. The struggle highlights the challenge of diversifying police forces amid a contentious national political environment.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cancellation of $500 million in federal grants for mRNA vaccine research is being condemned by scientific experts as a dangerous and baseless decision. The agency justified the move by citing a collection of research papers, but a closer look reveals that most of the documents are irrelevant or misrepresent the science. Critics argue the decision is rooted in Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine bias and will cede U.S. leadership in a vital medical technology with potential to fight cancer, HIV, and future pandemics.</p>

          <p>After being denied access for two months, several Democratic members of Congress inspected a Los Angeles ICE processing center but found it almost entirely empty, leading them to accuse the government of deliberately sanitizing the facility. The politicians, who had heard reports of severe overcrowding and poor conditions, found only two detainees in a center designed to hold over 300. They described the visit as a stonewalling tactic to prevent congressional oversight of the facility, which has been central to the administration's recent immigration crackdown in the region. The incident has intensified calls for transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>A summer leadership program in Southern California is teaching children from immigrant families about civic engagement, a lesson that has taken on new urgency amid recent immigration enforcement raids. The program, run by the legal center TODEC, helps kids understand how to create change, with many participants motivated by the fear and disruption they see in their communities. During a mock city council meeting, the children voted to fund mental health workshops to address the emotional toll of the raids. The initiative aims to empower a generation confronting the realities of family separation.</p>
