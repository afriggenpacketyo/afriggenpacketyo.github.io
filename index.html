          <p>A significant legal battle concerning former President Donald Trump's authority to impose broad tariffs is anticipated to reach the Supreme Court. The case centers on whether Trump overstepped his power by using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for his tariff strategy. A federal appeals court is expected to rule soon, and both the administration and the plaintiffs have indicated their intent to appeal an unfavorable decision. Legal experts suggest that regardless of the outcome, the administration has other trade tools available, meaning trade-related legal disputes are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to communications expert Lorraine K. Lee, certain common phrases can undermine one's professional authority and cause others to disregard their contributions. The article suggests replacing hesitant language like "I think" or "Does that make sense?" with more confident and direct alternatives such as "I recommend" or "Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything." These small adjustments in daily interactions, whether in emails or meetings, can significantly alter how colleagues perceive one's competence and conviction. The goal is to communicate with purpose and authority without sacrificing a collaborative tone.</p>

          <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has been arrested in connection with a serious assault at St Pancras railway station in London. The arrest occurred at Luton Airport as he returned on a flight from Faro, Portugal. British Transport Police stated the 42-year-old was wanted for questioning on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after a man was found with serious injuries on July 28. Video footage circulating on social media showed Robinson near the injured man, though it did not capture the assault itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has publicly called for police forces to release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. His comments came in response to a case in Warwickshire involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where two suspects were reportedly Afghan nationals. Farage argued that transparency would prevent online speculation and conspiracy theories, similar to those that followed the Southport attacks last year. Current police guidelines generally do not permit the sharing of a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after they have been charged.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to oust Democratic state lawmakers who fled Texas to prevent a vote on a new congressional redistricting map. The Democrats' departure denies Republicans the necessary quorum to proceed with the controversial bill, which could create up to five new GOP seats. In response, the absent lawmakers held events in Democrat-led states like New York and Illinois to protest the move, which they characterize as an attempt to rig future elections. Governor Abbott has set a deadline for their return, warning of potential job forfeiture and even felony charges.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has decimated populations along the West Coast since 2013, particularly the sunflower sea star. A new study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution pinpoints a specific bacterium, Vibrio pectinocida, as the causative agent. This discovery is a major breakthrough for conservation efforts, as sunflower sea stars are a keystone species crucial for controlling purple sea urchin populations and maintaining the health of kelp forests. The finding paves the way for developing diagnostic tests and breeding disease-resistant sea stars for reintroduction.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to lead Britain's MI5 intelligence agency, has passed away at the age of 90. Appointed Director-General in 1992, she broke significant barriers and was reportedly the inspiration for Judi Dench's portrayal of 'M' in the James Bond films. Rimington's tenure marked a period of increased openness for the traditionally secretive organization. After her retirement, she authored a memoir and a successful series of spy thrillers, continuing to influence public perception of the intelligence world. Her career paved the way for other women to hold top leadership roles in UK intelligence.</p>

          <p>The recent walkout by Texas Democratic lawmakers to block a Republican-led redistricting plan highlights a political tactic known as "breaking quorum." This move, while effective for delaying legislation and drawing national attention, has a mixed history of success. Political experts note that while walkouts can stall proceedings, governors often have the power to call perpetual special sessions, eventually forcing a resolution. This article examines past instances in states like Oregon and Minnesota, showing that while the tactic can sometimes force negotiations, it rarely blocks legislation permanently and often deepens partisan divisions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has indicated it may reconsider and potentially dismantle key protections against racial gerrymandering established under the Voting Rights Act. In a new order for the case Louisiana v. Callais, the justices have asked for briefings on whether a core precedent, Thornburg v. Gingles, is unconstitutional. This move suggests that the Court's recent decision in Allen v. Milligan, which upheld these protections in Alabama, may have been an exception rather than a rule. The potential shift could significantly weaken safeguards against diluting the voting power of racial minorities and remove a major obstacle to partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>According to a Morgan Stanley analysis, the world's largest tech companies are projected to dramatically increase their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure through 2026, signaling sustained confidence in the technology's growth. This spending benefits not only tech giants but also industrial companies involved in data center construction. Separately, following a weak jobs report, market expectations are leaning heavily toward a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Analysts suggest such a move could boost the stock market, as the economic data points to a slowdown that warrants monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged more than 20% after former President Donald Trump praised its new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump called the ad the "hottest out there," which immediately preceded the stock's sharp rise. The campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some public criticism and debate. The incident highlights the significant and immediate impact that political endorsements and cultural discourse can have on a company's stock market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest resuming for borrowers in the paused SAVE student loan plan, experts are advising them to switch to a new repayment plan to avoid costly consequences. Remaining in the SAVE forbearance will cause debt balances to grow and will not count toward loan forgiveness progress. The Department of Education has recommended borrowers move to an available income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, with the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan being a popular option. This guidance comes as the SAVE plan is now effectively defunct following legal challenges and recent legislative changes. (not investment advice)</p>

At a press conference, Matthews criticized the current political establishment and called for removing "wokeness" from the criminal justice system. The defection was met with derision from both the Prime Minister's office and the Labour party, who questioned the seriousness of Reform's platform.</p>
