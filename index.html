          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced its entry into the racing kart market, becoming the first major automaker to do so, with the goal of inspiring a new generation of auto enthusiasts. The company is developing karts intended to be affordable for families with children interested in motor sports, priced at about a quarter of the current market price, which is around 1.5 million yen ($10,400) in Japan. By making motor sports more accessible to children, Toyota aims to spark greater interest in automotive careers, hoping to inspire future drivers, engineers, and mechanics. The pricing and launch details are still to be determined as Toyota moves forward with this initiative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, challenging the ban on foreign students, could quickly reach the Supreme Court, reigniting debates over judicial recusal. Four Supreme Court justices have Harvard affiliations, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. While alumni status doesn't automatically warrant recusal, deeper involvement, such as Jackson's past service on the Harvard Board of Overseers, could necessitate it. The article explains that the decision to recuse is subjective and made solely by the justice involved, but the nexus between the justice and the specific interest in the litigation influences the potential for a conflict of interest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major American retail companies are reportedly pressuring their Chinese suppliers to absorb between 50% and 66% of the costs associated with U.S. import duties. This shift comes as the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China intensifies pressure on businesses to maintain stable prices. Previously, these retailers had agreed to bear the full cost of the tariffs when requesting suppliers to resume shipments, but now global brands, including Walmart, Target, Nike, Puma, and Adidas, are seeking to transfer a significant portion of these expenses to suppliers in China and Southeast Asia. Negotiations are ongoing, and the final division of tariff costs remains uncertain as both sides navigate a challenging period for the industry.</p>

          <p>The article discusses increasing international disapproval of Israel's war in Gaza, highlighting critical comments from Israeli politician Yair Golan, who described Israel as potentially becoming a pariah state. The conflict, initiated by a Hamas attack in 2023, has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis and widespread destruction in Gaza, leading to condemnation from figures like Theo Von and Ms. Rachel. International leaders, including the new Pope Leo XIV, have called for a ceasefire and respect for humanitarian law, with some countries reconsidering their relationship with Israel. Despite this shift in rhetoric, few allies have made material changes to their relationship with Israel, and the conflict continues with no clear resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests the euro could gain greater international prominence amid global uncertainty and shifting geopolitical landscapes, particularly with the U.S. dollar's dominant role being questioned. Lagarde outlined that Europe must establish a solid geopolitical foundation, reinforce its economic base, and bolster its legal foundation to elevate the euro's status. A stronger euro could lower borrowing costs, insulate Europe from exchange rate volatility, and protect it from sanctions. While analysts are divided, some suggest investors may diversify away from the dollar, potentially benefiting the euro, and Nomura forecasts the euro could rise to $1.20 by year's end (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, exceeding economists' forecasts of 6.7%, despite global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly expansion in the fiscal year 2025, driven by strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports. For the full fiscal year 2025, India's economy expanded by 6.5%, aligning with government estimates. While tensions with Pakistan and fragile ceasefires in Kashmir pose risks, improving consumer demand in rural areas supports continued growth, with the IMF projecting India's economy to modestly overtake Japan's, becoming the world's fourth-largest (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>While President Trump has shown fluctuating attitudes toward the conflict in Ukraine, recent developments indicate a potential improvement in Ukraine's diplomatic position. Despite past criticisms of President Zelenskyy and a brief halt in US assistance, Trump has expressed frustration with Putin's actions, even considering new sanctions. Key support, including weapons shipments and intelligence sharing, has largely continued, and allies may lift range restrictions on weapons, allowing Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia. The situation remains complex, but Ukraine has managed to maintain a level of support that could allow it to hold the line for the coming months.</p>

          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, citing factors beyond financial concerns and career priorities. The author suggests that redefined standards for parenting, including expectations for emotional support and accountability for children's mental health, contribute to this trend. The essay also highlights the growing phenomenon of adult children cutting off contact with parents, often citing emotional abuse or toxicity, which creates a new, almost impossible standard for parenting. This cultural shift leads many millennials to question whether they can meet these heightened expectations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is contesting a U.S. court ruling that deemed its tariff regime illegal, potentially blocking the president's global trade policy. The court argued that Trump's tariff orders exceeded his authority, as tariffs typically require congressional approval, which Trump bypassed by claiming a national emergency due to trade deficits. An appeals court has temporarily paused the decision pending a hearing, and the administration may take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary. Separately, a study reveals that the carbon footprint of Israelâ€™s war on Gaza is significant, exceeding the annual emissions of many countries.</p>

          <p>The article explores the concept of animal instincts through an interview with neuroscientist Mark Blumberg, who argues that the term "instinct" is often misused and confusing. Blumberg suggests using the phrase "species-typical" behavior instead, as it avoids presumptions about the behavior's origin or control. He emphasizes that behaviors are complex and shaped by a combination of genetic predispositions, environmental experiences, and learning. The discussion covers examples such as tailorbirds building nests and dogs herding sheep, highlighting the interplay between an animal's body, its environment, and its experiences in shaping behavior.</p>
