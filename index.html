            <p>While opioid settlements with pharmaceutical companies have led to billions in payouts, the majority of the funds are directed to state and local governments, rather than directly to victims. Individuals who filed claims have received meager compensation, often insufficient to cover basic needs, while governments receive substantial sums earmarked for addiction treatment and prevention. Advocates argue that governments are failing to prioritize victims' needs, and are urging them to allocate funds directly to affected individuals and families, ensuring that settlement money provides meaningful support to those who have suffered the most.</p>

            <p>Trump's imposition of a 46% tariff on Vietnam is threatening its economic growth and undermining relations between the two countries, potentially pushing Vietnam into China's sphere of influence. The tariff announcement damages the US's reputation as a reliable partner in the region, which is highly dependent on exports. China is expected to capitalize on this chaos, portraying itself as a steadfast partner.</p>
