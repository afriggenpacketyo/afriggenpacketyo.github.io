          <p>Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault, has died at 41. Giuffre gained prominence as a campaigner for survivors of sexual abuse after alleging she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew when she was a minor. Her family described her as a 'fierce warrior' who gave voice to the silenced and donated part of her settlement to other victims. Prince Andrew settled out of court with Giuffre, but has always denied the allegations. The allegations and subsequent media coverage significantly damaged Prince Andrew's reputation, leading him to step back from public duties. Her relentless pursuit of justice made her a public figure, though the fight took a significant toll on her life.</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance on single-sex spaces in response to a recent UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' as biological. The guidance clarifies that transgender women (biological men) may be excluded from women-only spaces, such as hospitals and schools, while emphasizing that transgender individuals should not be left without any facilities to use. It suggests providing mixed-sex facilities or individual lockable rooms where possible. The EHRC aims to provide updated guidance by the end of June after a consultation period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's war crimes in Ukraine, significant obstacles hinder its effectiveness. While the tribunal can investigate Russian leadership, including Putin, his immunity as head of state presents a major challenge. The Council of Europe does not have the power to waive this immunity, unlike the UN Security Council. There are debates about the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction, particularly whether it will include events prior to the full-scale invasion in 2022, such as the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Furthermore, the tribunal's future is uncertain, with potential shifts in political and financial support from key nations.</p>

          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in approval ratings for President Trump among Americans, including some Republicans. Surveys reveal concerns about his focus on priorities, handling of the economy, and immigration policies. A majority of respondents in one poll described Trump's second term as 'scary'. Approval ratings are particularly low among independent voters. These negative reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, suggesting growing fatigue after a period marked by market volatility and deportations.</p>

          <p>Charles Burnett's 'Killer of Sheep,' a landmark of American neorealism and Black independent filmmaking, has been restored in 4K and is returning to theaters. The film depicts the everyday life of Stan, a Watts-dwelling husband and father who works at a slaughterhouse. Rather than a conventional narrative, the film presents a mood, capturing the exhaustion and resilience of a working-class Black family in 1970s Los Angeles. The film's deceptively modest approach offers an understated paean to the Great Migration and the Black families who sought a fresh start in Los Angeles.</p>

The film follows a group of young adults who arrive at a remote cabin in search of a missing sister, only to find themselves in a time loop where they must die repeatedly to find a way to survive the night. The loop structure allows for more character development, and the film embraces its B-movie horror roots while delivering surprises. The film will likely appeal to fans of schlocky horror films.</p>

He also notes that carriers are unwilling to absorb the additional cost of tariffs, meaning consumers will bear the burden. Moffett also believes that backlash against Apple in China over U.S. tariffs will negatively impact iPhone sales.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions in his new term are seen as benefiting Russian President Vladimir Putin, including pressuring Ukraine to cede territory and promising sanctions relief. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine appears one-sided, allowing Russia to keep occupied regions and forbidding Ukraine from joining NATO. Additionally, Trump's actions on other fronts, such as creating rifts with allies and altering the U.S. government, align with Moscow's interests. These actions, intentional or not, serve to undermine American influence and support Russian objectives.</p>
