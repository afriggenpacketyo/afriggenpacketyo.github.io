          <p>Jane Goodall, the celebrated conservationist whose pioneering research in Tanzania revolutionized the world's understanding of chimpanzees, has passed away at the age of 91. Her groundbreaking discovery in the 1960s that chimpanzees make and use tools challenged the long-held definitions of what separates humans from other animals. After decades of field research, she established the Jane Goodall Institute and dedicated her later life to global advocacy, traveling extensively to speak about climate change and the urgent need to protect the natural world.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has intensified into a Category 2 storm as it bears down on Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds reaching 100 mph. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane warning for the island, anticipating damaging waves, significant storm surge, and heavy rainfall that could lead to flash flooding. Officials have stressed the seriousness of the threat, urging residents to prepare for the storm's impact. The hurricane's swells are also expected to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has confirmed the immobilization of an oil tanker off the French coast, linking it to Russia's 'shadow fleet' used to circumvent Western sanctions. The vessel was boarded by naval forces following suspicions of its involvement in drone flights over Denmark and for committing other "very serious wrongdoings." This incident highlights ongoing European efforts to combat the clandestine fleet of aging tankers, which is believed to play a crucial role in financing Russia's war effort in Ukraine by facilitating illicit oil sales.</p>

Despite arriving with less fanfare than other offseason additions, LaRavia is praised for his potential as a "three-and-D" player who can complement the team's stars. A career 42.9% three-point shooter, he is expected to provide valuable floor spacing and defensive versatility. Coach JJ Redick has expressed high confidence in LaRavia's commitment and his fit within the team's long-term plans.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that the top-performing stocks of the third quarter could serve as a valuable guide for investors through the end of the year. He noted that companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, and Warner Bros. Discovery saw massive gains driven by the AI boom and takeover speculation. Cramer believes fund managers may continue to buy these winners to bolster their portfolios. However, he also issued a word of caution, stating that while these stocks might keep rallying, the biggest gains of the year may have already been made. (not investment advice)</p>

The article explains that rapeseed (vegetable) and sunflower oils are healthy options high in beneficial unsaturated fats, contrary to some negative claims. It also notes that modern margarines are safe, as harmful trans fats have been removed from their formulation. While extra virgin olive oil has a low smoke point unsuitable for deep frying, basic olive oil can be effectively used for shallow frying.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is having a remarkable start to the season, leading the NFL with 42 catches for 503 yards through the first four games. His performance, which earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, is drawing comparisons to teammate Cooper Kupp's historic 2021 triple-crown season. Nacua's physical playing style and impressive ability to gain yards after the catch have quickly made him a favorite target of quarterback Matthew Stafford and a player admired by the entire Rams organization.</p>

          <p>Actor Eric Dane, known for his roles in "Grey's Anatomy" and "Euphoria," is now publicly advocating for legislation to help those with ALS, the neurodegenerative disease he was diagnosed with earlier this year. Dane met with a U.S. Congressman to urge the continuation of a law that funds research and provides patients with early access to experimental treatments. Having shifted from private anger to public action, Dane stated he is determined to fight the disease and wants to live to see his two young daughters grow up.</p>

          <p>Eight months into President Trump's second term, his administration's aggressive legal and financial pressure campaign against so-called "sanctuary" cities and states has produced minimal results. The Justice Department has filed numerous lawsuits against jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, but most cases remain tied up in court. Furthermore, attempts to withhold federal funding from these localities have been largely blocked by federal judges, with only one city known to have changed its policies in response to the administration's efforts.</p>

          <p>North Korea appears to be undertaking a significant shift in its military strategy, expanding its focus beyond nuclear deterrence to include the comprehensive modernization of its conventional armed forces. Leader Kim Jong-un has signaled a new policy of advancing both nuclear and conventional capabilities simultaneously, a move likely influenced by lessons from the war in Ukraine. This development, potentially supported by Russian assistance, represents a critical new variable that could dramatically escalate the security threat posed by Pyongyang in the region.</p>

          <p>Recent polling suggests that President Trump's support among Latino voters, who were a crucial part of his 2024 election victory, is declining. The erosion of support appears to be driven primarily by economic issues, with a majority of Hispanic respondents in a New York Times/Sienna poll disapproving of his job performance and believing he has worsened the economy. While this dissatisfaction is growing, Democratic-commissioned polling indicates that the party has not yet made significant gains among these voters, who still rank the economy as their top concern.</p>

When Carter's foundation began its work in 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases annually across Asia and Africa; by 2024, that number was reduced to just 14. The film celebrates this monumental public health victory, which was achieved not through medicine or vaccines, but through education, providing access to clean water, and the tireless efforts of local health workers.</p>

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in third-quarter U.S. sales, fueled by a record-breaking surge in electric vehicle purchases. The strong EV sales were largely driven by consumers rushing to capitalize on a $7,500 federal tax incentive before it expired at the end of September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, highlighting a significant market shift. To maintain this momentum, some automakers are now introducing their own incentives to offset the loss of the federal credit. (not investment advice)</p>
