          <p>To commemorate the 60th anniversary of normalized diplomatic ties, Japan will introduce fast-track entry lanes for South Korean visitors at Tokyo's Haneda and Fukuoka airports throughout June, while South Korea will reciprocate at Gimpo in Seoul and Gimhae in Busan. This marks the first time Japan has implemented lanes exclusively for a specific nationality, aiming to boost mutual exchange between the two nations. The initiative targets visitors who have traveled between Japan and South Korea within the past year, requiring them to complete pre-boarding procedures to utilize the expedited service, available for flights arriving between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. This measure underscores the growing tourism between the two countries, fueled by cultural interests despite occasional historical tensions.</p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing criticism for stating he doesn't buy rice due to receiving it as gifts, which sparked outrage amid rising rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation, acknowledging responsibility for the controversial comments. Ishiba is expected to replace Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular figure in the Liberal Democratic Party. This scandal surfaces as Ishiba prepares for a crucial House of Councillors election, aiming to regain public trust shaken by previous political fund scandals. Eto's resignation follows the Ministry of Agriculture's decision to release emergency rice stockpiles to combat soaring prices, which have doubled in the past year.</p>

          <p>Matthew Lee Johnson was executed in Texas for the 2012 death of Nancy Harris, a convenience store clerk who was set on fire during a robbery. Johnson admitted to setting Harris on fire, expressing remorse and claiming he was under the influence of drugs at the time. Harris, a 76-year-old great-grandmother, suffered severe burns and described the suspect before she died. Johnson's execution took place exactly 13 years after the attack, following unsuccessful appeals to halt the process.

An estimated 12.22 million students are expected to graduate this year, putting additional pressure on the economy to create sufficient high-quality jobs.

          <p>Japan's exports to the U.S. experienced a decline for the first time since December of last year, attributed to trade tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. The drop in exports of transport equipment, including motor vehicles, contributed to a narrowing of Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. Experts anticipate that net exports will continue to negatively impact Japan's GDP growth in the second quarter. Negotiations between Japan and the U.S. regarding trade deals appear to have stalled, with Japan's top trade negotiator reiterating the country's request for the removal of tariffs imposed by the U.S.</p>

The legislators advocate for alternative water solutions, including wastewater recycling and levee improvements. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has already invested in preliminary planning for the project, while opponents claim the project lacks public oversight and would unduly burden ratepayers.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has suspended its bonus scheme for senior executives following public criticism and government intervention. The scheme, potentially worth up to 50% of senior bosses' pay, was linked to securing a £3bn rescue loan. The decision came after Downing Street deemed rewarding executives for failure unacceptable. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations. Thames Water has faced heavy criticism over its performance, including sewage discharges and leaks, leading to government standby for special administration.</p>

          <p>A new test that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham. Surgeons have described the "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing as a "game changer" and say it could improve care and treatment for thousands of patients. The method has already been used in 50 operations at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust with a 100% success rate. The new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, and could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly.</p>

The American Farm Bureau Federation has also called for a careful review of the report based on sound science.
