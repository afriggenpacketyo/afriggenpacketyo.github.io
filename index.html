          <p>A shooting at Featherly Regional Park in Yorba Linda, California, left three people injured. According to police, the incident stemmed from an earlier altercation, after which the suspect returned and attempted to run over another man with his car. The suspect then shot two people before turning the gun on himself. All three victims were hospitalized, and their conditions remain unknown as of Sunday night; police believe the victims and suspect knew each other, calling it an isolated incident.</p>

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that failing to address England's social care system for older and disabled adults is unsustainable and financially damaging. The report highlights that taxpayers are currently paying Â£32 billion annually for a broken system, which is further burdened by unpaid carers. The committee suggests that investment in social care could improve the quality of care and drive economic growth, potentially creating 50,000 jobs with an additional Â£1 billion investment. The government acknowledges the need for deep reform and has established an independent commission to address the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption crackdown within the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. The campaign has targeted high-ranking officials, including members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), for corruption. Experts believe that the impact on the military's war readiness and modernization is limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor to these investigations. The campaign underscores Xi's commitment to rooting out corruption and maintaining discipline within the PLA.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing concerns that the American film industry is "dying" due to incentives offered by other countries. Trump considers this a "national security threat," arguing that it impacts messaging and propaganda. He has authorized government agencies to begin imposing the tariff, aiming to bring movie production back to America. This announcement follows China's recent decision to reduce the number of US films it imports, further escalating trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

Critics question the effectiveness of the recent offensive in securing hostage releases and challenge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives. The military plans to operate in new areas and destroy infrastructure above and below ground, but the expansion may be delayed until after President Trump's visit to the region.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory following reports of alleged animal abuse and pressure from government officials. The White Coat Waste (WCW) project detailed the lab's history of reportedly conducting deadly experiments on thousands of beagles. PETA praised the closure, highlighting the importance of modernizing science and ending animal testing. The NIH director stated that PETA sent him flowers following the closure, a departure from the physical threats NIH directors typically receive. The move aligns with a broader trend of phasing out animal testing in favor of alternative methods.</p>

Trump claimed that having trials for every illegal immigrant would be impractical and that the Supreme Court would not allow it.

Norris was further delayed because he passed Verstappen off track at Turn 11 and had to cede the position. Stella saw no significant difference between Norris's and Piastri's approaches to racing Verstappen. Ultimately, Norris closed on Piastri but ran out of time to overtake him.</p>

Aetna's parent company, CVS, made the decision despite surpassing financial expectations. The expiration of ACA tax credits and financial incentives, implemented by the Biden administration, is partly responsible for the withdrawal. CVS stated that Aetna is not a major player in the ACA marketplace and that it will continue to offer other health benefit solutions. Aetna had previously been removed from the marketplace in 2017 and 2018 before returning in 2021.</p>

While egg freezing offers women more control over their reproductive timelines, it is expensive and not guaranteed to result in a successful pregnancy.
