        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed ongoing discussions with the U.S. government regarding the potential export of a new, more advanced artificial intelligence chip, the B30A, to China. This follows a period of stringent U.S. restrictions on semiconductor exports and recent scrutiny from Chinese authorities over alleged security vulnerabilities in Nvidia's H20 chips, which were previously designed for the Chinese market. Huang advocates for allowing these advanced sales, arguing it ensures American technology underpins China's burgeoning AI sector and prevents domestic tech giants like Huawei from filling the void. The intricate negotiations underscore the significant geopolitical and economic tensions impacting the global semiconductor industry, with Nvidia's stock experiencing a slight dip amid the uncertainty.

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke lost his libel case against The Guardian newspaper, which had published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. Clarke's legal team argued in the High Court that accusations of him being a "serial abuser of women" were false and stemmed from an "unlawful conspiracy." The Guardian, however, defended its reporting, asserting it was based on a "careful and thorough investigation conducted conscientiously." The court's dismissal of the lawsuit means the newspaper successfully defended its articles regarding the sensitive allegations, which had previously led to the suspension of Clarke's BAFTA award and membership. This outcome affirms the Guardian's reporting and highlights the complexities of defamation cases involving public figures and serious accusations.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of history's greatest companies, suggesting that investing in its stock would be "very smart." This commendation arrives as the U.S. administration reportedly explores acquiring equity stakes in tech firms receiving CHIPS Act funding, with TSMC promised $6.6 billion for Arizona plants. Huang's primary visit to Taiwan was to thank TSMC for their work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin, highlighting TSMC's role in developing six new products for Nvidia. Separately, an article reported Nvidia paused H20 chip production for China following security concerns raised by Beijing, despite earlier export license approvals. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chocolate prices are expected to continue rising due to the lagged impact of soaring cocoa costs, which hit record highs from adverse weather and supply tightness in West Africa, responsible for three-quarters of global supply. This trend, combined with broader retail inflation, has already led to significant price jumps for chocolate products in the U.S. and U.K. Experts like Lindt & Sprüngli's head believe cocoa prices will not return to previous low levels, and recent declines in futures will take time to reflect in retail. However, a slightly brighter outlook is projected for next Easter, as industrial demand softens and supply improves, although structural prices are expected to remain elevated.</p>

This decision comes after years of advocacy from civil society groups and an earlier court ruling upholding the name change. The court cited an unresolved lawsuit from a citizens' initiative opposing the change, prolonging a debate rooted in Germany's colonial past and the historical use of the term "Moor."</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption surged to a historic high of 1.02 trillion kilowatt-hours in July, marking an 8.6% year-on-year increase. This unprecedented demand, equivalent to the annual usage of all Asean nations combined, was primarily driven by scorching heatwaves across the country. The primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, experienced the fastest growth in electricity use, up 20.2% compared to the previous year. Despite this significant energy surge, industrial output growth in July slowed compared to June, suggesting a complex interplay between environmental factors, such as extreme weather, and the broader economic activity in China.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted of a royal defamation charge, known as lese majeste, which could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the evidence and witnesses too weak, suggesting potential political bias in the prosecution stemming from his opponents. This acquittal provides a significant reprieve for the Shinawatra family, especially as Thaksin's daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the current prime minister, faces a separate ethics case that could lead to her removal. Despite past convictions and a controversial return from 15 years of exile, Thaksin has largely avoided significant prison time, maintaining a high public profile that continues to challenge Thailand's powerful conservative establishment.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a high-profile speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as the central bank considers its first interest rate cut of 2025. This comes amidst persistent pressure from President Donald Trump to lower rates, who has also publicly criticized Fed officials and their handling of central bank projects. The Fed faces a significant dilemma: cutting rates could potentially worsen inflation, while holding steady risks tipping the economy into a downturn, especially given recent slowdowns in hiring and a pickup in underlying inflation. Powell's remarks are highly anticipated for insights into the Fed's monetary policy direction and its commitment to maintaining independence from political influence, a stance he previously affirmed.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was moving away from the northeastern U.S. coast as a Category 1 storm, but dangerous swimming conditions are expected to persist for days. The National Hurricane Center warned that Erin would likely become post-tropical but remain a powerful hurricane-force low-pressure system through the weekend. Although the storm's center was forecast to pass south of Atlantic Canada, its broad reach caused coastal flooding in parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks and Virginia. Life-threatening surf and rip currents led to dozens of rescues this week, prompting warnings and beach closures from South Florida up to New England.

Despite bipartisan congressional support and compelling evidence showing participants are significantly more likely to earn bachelor's degrees, the White House views TRIO as a "relic of the past." Advocates, including the Council for Opportunity in Education, argue that cutting the $1.2 billion annual funding would devastate opportunities for students in underserved regions like Appalachia, where college attainment rates are particularly low. The future of TRIO remains uncertain as Congress debates the budget, with the administration already unilaterally canceling some previously approved grants.</p>

As of Thursday, two of these vessels, including the Bohai Zuanzhu, Asia's largest ro-ro passenger ship, had docked at the port of Quanzhou in Fujian province, with the remaining five in nearby waters. The Bohai Zuanzhu's capacity to carry extra-long, extra-wide, and extra-high special vehicles, coupled with its displacement comparable to the PLA's Type 075 amphibious assault ship, has drawn attention. This unusual concentration of large transport vessels in the geopolitically sensitive Taiwan Strait has naturally raised questions regarding their purpose and potential implications.</p>

          <p>A counterintuitive trend in U.S. healthcare reveals that paying the cash price for certain medical services, like prenatal genetic tests, can be significantly cheaper than using health insurance. One woman, Mara Varona, discovered this after being billed $750 for a Natera genetic test that her insurer paid only 45 cents for, despite the company having offered a $349 cash price directly. Researchers confirm this phenomenon across various services, attributing it to administrative ease for providers, consumers' tendency to shop around for cash prices, and insurers' profit motives, as lower medical spending can reduce their revenue. This article advises patients to question bills and proactively explore cash options, as insurance companies cannot always be relied to secure the lowest prices.</p>

While nationwide median prices saw a minimal increase, many major metro areas experienced price softening, particularly in the South and West. Mortgage rates have also inched down, though experts predict rates will remain near 6.6% through year-end, with potential for further slight dips in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi initially suggested a "client list" was under review, but the Justice Department later stated no such list existed and opposed further disclosure due to victim privacy concerns. President Trump has since dismissed the focus on Epstein as a "hoax" and urged people to move on, while the DOJ has made motions to unseal some grand jury testimony in related cases, amidst ongoing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Millions of travelers across the UK are warned of significant disruption over the upcoming bank holiday weekend, facing busy roads, a rail strike, and extensive engineering works. The RMT union strike will cause no CrossCountry services on Saturday, with limited operations on Monday, severely impacting routes from Aberdeen to Cornwall. The RAC predicts 17.6 million car trips, with particularly heavy traffic expected on the M5 between Bristol and Devon, and the M20 in Kent. Despite these widespread travel challenges, the weather forecast is mostly dry and warmer, with highs of 27C in parts of England and Wales, potentially drawing large crowds to numerous festivals and events scheduled across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe's prolonged and scorching summer heatwave, exacerbated by global warming, has dramatically increased demand for Chinese air conditioners. In July, China's AC exports to the continent surged by nearly 60% by volume compared to the previous year, with cities from Paris to Madrid experiencing extreme temperatures. This situation has laid bare Europe's unpreparedness for such intense heat, as much of the continent is situated at latitudes similar to China's northeast. This surge in demand significantly benefits Chinese brands, which dominate the global AC market, producing approximately 80% of the world's cooling units. The article highlights the direct economic impact of climate change, creating a booming market for Chinese manufacturers in a previously less AC-dependent region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has backed down from imposing high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, agreeing to limit them to 15% in a new trade deal. This decision follows earlier threats by President Trump to raise pharmaceutical tariffs to as high as 250%, driven by a desire to boost domestic production. Under the agreement, the U.S. will apply the 15% tariff rate on most European goods, including semiconductors and lumber, from September 1st. In return, the EU is expected to reduce tariffs on "all US industrial goods" to zero, with a further reduction on European car exports to 15% contingent on EU legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

The easing was primarily driven by a deceleration in rice inflation, which had previously soared due to a shortage. Despite the moderation, this article notes that the 3.1% headline inflation marks the 40th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, prompting some experts to criticize the BOJ for being "behind the curve" in raising interest rates.
