          <p>For the first time, a senior official in Xinjiang has publicly admitted that U.S. sanctions are negatively affecting the region's economy and employment opportunities. Chen Weijun, the autonomous region's vice-chairman, stated that some local enterprises are facing difficulties with exports, leading to production cuts and fewer jobs for people of all ethnic groups, including Uygurs. Despite these short-term challenges, Chen expressed confidence in the region's long-term development prospects. The government has not released specific data detailing the number of jobs lost as a direct result of the international sanctions.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and CBP, have internally circulated claims that certain emojis could signify affiliation with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. These assertions, found in official briefings and training materials, have been strongly criticized by gang experts and immigration lawyers as "baseless" and "uneducated." Critics express concern that such profiling could lead to wrongful accusations and deportations, drawing parallels to previous controversial practices where tattoos were used as supposed evidence of gang membership. The article highlights the potential for these claims to unjustly impact immigrants amid a broader political focus on the gang.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new, 19th package of sanctions against Russia, aiming to increase pressure on Moscow to cease its war in Ukraine. This development comes as EU finance ministers discuss utilizing frozen Russian assets to provide financial aid to Kyiv. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for more decisive international action following another significant Russian drone attack on Ukrainian cities, which caused infrastructure damage. A top UK intelligence official also stated there is currently no evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin is interested in pursuing peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that the UK Border Force is responsible for policing the nation's borders, although it maintains a working relationship with the navy. The statement came as the UK's new "one in, one out" deportation deal with France saw its second migrant returned.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's aggressive expansion of its third-party online marketplace has led to significant problems with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers. In its effort to compete with Amazon, Walmart reportedly relaxed its seller vetting processes, allowing bad actors to use stolen business identities to sell fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly, contributing to what some experts call a "Wild West" environment on the platform. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened vetting for some product categories.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has ignited a national debate over free speech, particularly after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's show following comments he made about the event. This has led to concerns about government pressure on media, with President Trump suggesting broadcasters critical of him could lose their licenses. In separate news, a CDC advisory committee has recommended that young children receive the MMR and chickenpox vaccines separately, rather than as a combined MMRV shot.

          <p>President Donald Trump responded with alarm to a federal appeals court ruling that found his across-the-board tariffs illegal, claiming the decision would "literally destroy the United States of America." The court determined that the President overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which does not explicitly grant power to impose such tariffs. This article argues that Trump's hysterical language is an attempt to intimidate the Supreme Court, which will hear the appeal. The author contends that blocking the tariffs would actually benefit the U.S. economy by reducing inflation and preventing further economic disruption.</p>

A recent survey of EU businesses highlighted these tensions, revealing that a vast majority of applications for a key Chinese export permit program were not approved.

          <p>Amid a crisis of public trust in higher education and the rise of AI, this article argues that the core purpose of a university is more vital than ever. The author, Dartmouth's president, contends that a residential college experience is uniquely suited to cultivate essential human skills like critical thinking, empathy, and collaborative leadership. These skills are developed through face-to-face dialogue and debate, which are difficult to replicate in online environments engineered to confirm biases. As technology increasingly isolates individuals, higher education must double down on its mission to teach students how to think, not what to think.</p>

          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £18 billion in August, the highest figure for that month since the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago. According to the Office for National Statistics, the increase was driven by higher spending on public services, benefits, and rising debt interest costs, which outpaced the growth in tax receipts. This figure exceeded analysts' expectations and puts additional pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget. The deteriorating public finances may force the government to consider tax increases or spending cuts to meet its self-imposed fiscal rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio has warned that "unsustainable" U.S. government spending and spiraling debt are creating a major fiscal crisis that risks devaluing major world currencies. He argues that as governments continue excessive borrowing, the appeal of traditional fiat money as a store of wealth will diminish. Consequently, Dalio suggests that gold and other non-fiat currencies will become more reliable repositories of value, recommending that investors consider diversifying their portfolios to include an allocation to gold. Another expert noted these fiscal risks are not unique to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has launched its new iPhone 17 series worldwide, with new models drawing crowds in major cities from Beijing to London. The global release is a crucial test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi. While initial preorder data from China appears positive, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout. The launch includes the iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and the new, thinner iPhone Air, alongside updated Apple Watch and AirPods models.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified human remains discovered in Oregon's Cascade Mountains in 1976 as those of Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter, who vanished in 1974 at the age of 21. The 50-year-old cold case was solved using genetic genealogy, which connected the remains to McWhorter's sister, Valerie Nagle. Nagle had submitted her DNA to an ancestry website in the hopes of finding a clue about her sister's disappearance. The Linn County Sheriff's Office is now investigating the circumstances surrounding McWhorter's death, which is not believed to have been voluntary.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show from the air represents a dangerous capitulation to political pressure from the Trump administration. The move followed comments Kimmel made about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, which prompted the Trump-appointed FCC chairman to issue what were perceived as threats against the network's broadcast licenses. The author contends this is part of a broader pattern of media companies becoming more compliant with the administration's wishes, creating a chilling effect on free speech. This trend is described as a dire sign for American democracy.</p>

Key changes include restoring inquests that were previously halted, establishing independent oversight for investigations, and creating a cross-border commission to receive information.

Although the jury found Geragos had breached his duties, it also determined that Franklin was not substantially harmed, creating a legal contradiction.
