          <p>Pakistan's military has stated that over 50 individuals, including 40 civilians and 11 armed forces members, were killed due to Indian strikes last week, a rise from the previously reported 33 civilian deaths. These strikes targeted "terrorist infrastructure" in response to an attack on Hindu tourists in India-administered Kashmir. Despite early claims of violations from both sides, a US-brokered ceasefire seems to be holding, with senior military officials from India and Pakistan communicating via hotline. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned of retaliation if further terror attacks occur, while Pakistan affirms its commitment to the ceasefire, raising concerns about ongoing tensions in the region.

          <p>This article discusses the current landscape of CD interest rates and strategies for maximizing savings in an economy with persistent inflation. It highlights that leading CD accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate and allow investors to lock in high rates for the term of the CD. The article advises comparing rates from online banks, which often have fewer overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve. Ultimately, it encourages individuals to explore various banking options and term lengths to achieve their savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history.

          <p>President Trump invoked golfer Sam Snead to justify accepting a $400 million plane from Qatar, despite previous concerns about Qatar's alleged funding of terrorism. He likened the situation to accepting a gimme in golf, arguing it would be "stupid" to refuse the gift. This decision has raised ethical questions, especially considering his family's ongoing deals with Saudi-owned firms, Qatari backing of Trump projects, and involvement in cryptocurrency ventures. The analogy reveals Trump's view of the world as a golf course, where only a fool would decline an advantage.</p>

          <p>Economists and policymakers are bracing for a potential re-acceleration of inflation due to President Trump's trade war, despite a slight cooling in April. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3 percent annually, but experts forecast prices to increase as import taxes take effect. While a temporary reduction in tariffs with China has eased concerns, economists warn that tariffs still in place will likely stoke inflation while simultaneously denting growth. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation, wary of a potential persistent inflation problem.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, questioning whether he exceeded his power in enacting duties on over 180 countries. Five domestic businesses filed the lawsuit, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to impose such sweeping tariffs. The plaintiffs claim that the declared "national emergency" is unfounded and seek to block Trump's executive order. The Department of Justice argues that IEEPA clearly authorizes the president to impose tariffs.</p>

Economists are monitoring for early signs of President Trump's tariffs impacting households, as tariffs are expected to boost consumer prices.

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with their bill to fund President Trumpâ€™s agenda, including tax and Medicaid cuts, despite internal divisions. The bill outlines plans to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, making more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. It also includes a permanent extension of Trumpâ€™s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act, a temporary increase in the child tax credit, and a controversial tax proposal that would hike the cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT).</p>

          <h2>Inflation Eased After Trump's 'Liberation Day' Tariffs, Defying Fears</h2>

          <p>Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, cooling slightly and defying fears of an inflation surge after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. Egg prices fell, while gasoline prices dropped 12% over the past year. However, analysts anticipate a potential rekindling of inflation as retailers replenish inventory with goods imported after the tariffs. A rollback of some levies may soften the impact, but an across-the-board 10% tariff remains on imports from nearly all countries. The Federal Reserve is taking a wait-and-see approach on Trump's tariff policy, which could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.</p>

          <p>The pace of inflation slowed in April, coinciding with President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on the US's largest trading partners. The annual inflation rate was 2.3%, down from 2.4% in March. While the report covers the period after Trump's announcement, businesses are still assessing the tariffs' impact. Consumer sentiment dropped, and inflation expectations rose. Economists anticipate price increases to worsen this year as goods imported before the tariffs are sold. The Federal Reserve expects tariffs to impact prices, potentially delaying inflation from reaching its 2% target.</p>

Despite claims that China needed the US more, Trump's administration backtracked without securing meaningful concessions. The move underscores the mutually beneficial nature of trade and the potential for price hikes and shortages due to tariffs. While some tariffs remain higher than before Trump's second term, the rollback reflects the economic pressures and political risks of a prolonged trade war.</p>
