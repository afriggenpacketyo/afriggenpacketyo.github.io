          <p>Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to commence in Egypt following Hamas's conditional acceptance of a peace plan proposed by former President Donald Trump. The deal requires Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages, give up its weapons, and relinquish governance in Gaza in exchange for amnesty for its members. While the plan envisions a gradual Israeli withdrawal and a provisional government, key details, such as a timeline for withdrawal and Hamas's disarmament, remain unresolved. Skepticism persists as negotiators head to Egypt, with the outcome of these talks being critical for ending the conflict and addressing the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man has been taken into custody on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following a fire at a mosque in Peacehaven, East Sussex. The incident, which occurred on a Saturday night, caused damage to the building's front entrance and a vehicle but resulted in no injuries. Sussex Police, who had earlier released CCTV images of two suspects, are treating the event as a hate crime. The investigation is reportedly progressing quickly as authorities work to identify all individuals responsible for what they termed an "appalling and reckless attack."</p>

Al-Shamie, who was on police bail for an alleged sexual assault, was shot by firearms officers, and Mr. Daulby is believed to have been hit by police gunfire in the crossfire.

The leadership change, which also includes the appointment of Mark Bertolini as chairman, aims to steer Verizon towards a new phase of customer focus and financial growth. Schulman, who has served on Verizon's board since 2018, is credited with significantly growing PayPal's revenue and customer base.

          <h2>Illinois and Chicago Sue to Prevent Federalization of National Guard</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a joint lawsuit to block the Trump administration from federalizing and deploying the National Guard to the city. The complaint argues that such a deployment, without the state's consent and in the absence of an insurrection, violates federal law and the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. This legal action follows a similar move by Oregon, where a judge granted a temporary restraining order against a National Guard deployment. The lawsuit cites the president's rhetoric about using Democratic-led cities as military training grounds as evidence of political motivation.</p>

          <p>Lithuania is developing TechZity, a €100 million project in Vilnius set to become Europe's largest startup hub by 2028, housing 5,000 workers. This initiative aims to replicate the success of the country's fintech sector, which has issued the most licenses in the European Union by creating a favorable regulatory environment. Founders hope the new hub will foster creativity and innovation, with the ambitious goal of having the startup sector contribute 25% of the nation's GDP by 2030. However, challenges remain, including access to capital and the need for more skilled talent to support this rapid growth.</p>

          <p>Foreclosure filings in the U.S. have risen for six consecutive months, up 18% from a year ago, as homeowners struggle with the increasing costs of living. Rising expenses for home insurance, property taxes, and utilities, combined with a slowing job market, are placing significant financial strain on households. Many homeowners, like Kimberly Draxler of Kentucky who narrowly avoided foreclosure, find themselves unable to keep up with mortgage payments after an unexpected loss of income. While still below pre-pandemic levels, the upward trend in foreclosures highlights the growing economic vulnerability faced by many American homeowners in the current high-interest-rate environment.</p>

The company is also restructuring internally to focus more on individual sports categories to reignite innovation.

          <p>With average credit card interest rates currently at 22.25%, making only the minimum payment on a significant balance, such as $10,000, can lead to decades of debt and thousands of dollars in interest. A typical minimum payment, often calculated as 1% of the balance plus interest, would start at around $283, with only $100 going toward the principal. This structure is designed to keep consumers in debt for as long as possible, primarily benefiting the credit card issuers. Financial experts advise paying well above the minimum to reduce the principal faster, lower credit utilization, and avoid the long-term financial trap of compounding interest.</p>

The union argues that the government's pledge to add 1,000 training places is insufficient to address the crisis.

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed processing student loan forgiveness for some borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, according to the Student Loan Servicing Alliance. This relief, which was paused in July, grants debt cancellation to individuals who have been making payments for 20 to 25 years. The pause was attributed to legal challenges surrounding the separate SAVE repayment plan, which affected how payment counts were calculated. The resumption of IBR discharges is a central issue in a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers against the Education Department over alleged delays in promised debt relief.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in downtown Montgomery, Alabama, that killed two people, including a 17-year-old, and injured twelve others has intensified calls for a citywide curfew. However, the city already has a curfew in place for the downtown entertainment district, restricting unaccompanied minors under 17 from 9 p.m. on weekdays and 11 p.m. on weekends. The shooting occurred around 11:30 p.m. on a Saturday, raising questions about the effectiveness and enforcement of the existing ordinance. As the police investigation continues with no arrests made, the community is debating whether stricter measures are needed to curb youth violence.</p>

The acquisition is aimed at bolstering Firefly's national security capabilities by integrating SciTec's software for missile warning, tracking, and defense. This strategic move follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test that caused Firefly's stock to drop, but the company continues to build key government partnerships, including a major contract with NASA. SciTec will operate as a subsidiary of Firefly once the deal closes at the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident, which prosecutors say stemmed from a parking dispute, involved a 69-year-old man who sustained significant injuries. Sanchez, 38, was also injured in the altercation and was initially arrested on misdemeanor charges. The charges were upgraded to a felony due to the severity of the victim's injuries, and Sanchez could face one to six years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have significantly reduced the monthly payments for homebuyers, with the average 30-year fixed rate now at 6.34%. For a $550,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a principal and interest payment of $3,418.70, over $200 less per month compared to rates at the beginning of the year. This decrease in borrowing costs is making homeownership more accessible for many who were previously priced out of the market. The article also explores the financial implications of refinancing at current rates, noting that homeowners could also achieve substantial monthly savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials located and killed a young male bear that was seen in the campground and matched photos the victim had sent to his family shortly before the attack. While fatal bear attacks are rare in North America, this incident has prompted the temporary closure of the campground as authorities conduct further tests.</p>

          <p>The superstructure, or "island," on an aircraft carrier is almost always located on the starboard (right) side of the flight deck for a critical aerodynamic reason related to propeller-driven aircraft. The clockwise rotation of most Western aircraft engines creates a natural tendency for planes to yaw to the left upon takeoff and landing due to phenomena like the P-factor and spiraling slipstream. Placing the island on the right side provides pilots with a clear visual reference for landings without obstructing the natural leftward drift of the aircraft. This design choice, established early in carrier history, has become a standard for naval aviation.</p>
