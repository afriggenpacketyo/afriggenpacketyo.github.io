          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have not significantly boosted the stock market as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the United States. Analysts suggest that markets had already priced in the policies, and worries about economic deterioration outweigh policy optimism. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and prop up the real estate sector.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have added charges in the sexual assault case against Oren, Tal, and Alon Alexander, luxury real estate brokers, now including six victims, one of whom is an underage girl.

The brothers, who have pleaded not guilty, are accused of luring, drugging, and sexually assaulting their victims, sometimes with multiple men involved. The case has sent shockwaves through the high-end real estate industry, leading to the downfall of Oren and Tal Alexander's careers.</p>

          <p>Josh Raffaelli, a former fund manager at Brookfield Asset Management, has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of fraud and attempted bribery. Raffaelli claims Brookfield mistreated investors to cover losses in other business areas and improperly limited his investments in an Elon Musk company. The lawsuit alleges that Brookfield backtracked on investment pledges and vetoed a major foreign conglomerate's investment, limiting potential gains for clients. Brookfield denies the claims, stating the suit is without merit and brought by a disgruntled former employee. Mark Carney, Canada's new prime minister, was chairman of Brookfield until January.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump proposes creating a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This move would partially reverse tax cuts from 2017 and aims to offset spending cuts to Medicaid, addressing concerns about the optics of benefiting the rich while cutting benefits for the poor. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>A directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has led to significant changes in the curriculum at West Point, with classes canceled, books banned, and professors resigning in protest. The order, aimed at removing ideologies deemed "divisive" and "un-American," has shaken the academy and raised concerns about academic freedom. The English department purged works by Black authors, and a history professor was instructed not to mention atrocities against Native Americans. The changes have forced faculty to grapple with balancing academic principles and military obligations.</p>

Director Alex Ross Perry aims to capture the band's unique spirit and legacy by creating a fictional world where Pavement is the "worldâ€™s most important and influential band." The film explores the band's history, its relationship with success, and the impact of its music on fans.
