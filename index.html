          <p>IBM reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, with total revenue growing nearly 8% year-over-year. Despite the positive results, the company's shares dropped by as much as 5% in extended trading. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that geopolitical tensions and constrained U.S. federal spending have caused some clients to act cautiously. The company's generative AI business has grown to $7.5 billion, and it maintained its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new AI Action Plan to ensure U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. The strategy includes over 90 federal actions, such as expediting data center construction, supporting semiconductor manufacturing, and modernizing the electrical grid. It also aims to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems by setting new rules for government contractors and withholding funds from states with what it calls burdensome regulations. The plan emphasizes exporting AI technology to allies to compete with nations like China.</p>

          <p>During Bryan Kohberger's sentencing for the 2022 University of Idaho murders, relatives of the victims delivered powerful and emotional impact statements. The families confronted the admitted killer directly, expressing their grief and anger, with one sister stating he "picked the wrong families" to target. The two surviving roommates also described their ongoing trauma and guilt since the attack. Kohberger was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without parole after pleading guilty as part of a deal to remove the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Tesla has reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue, marking the second straight quarter of falling sales that missed analysts' estimates. The company's financial slump is attributed partly to increased competition and backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Despite the downturn, Tesla announced it has begun initial builds of a more affordable model planned for 2025. Musk continues to emphasize the company's future in robotaxis and robotics, aiming for autonomous ride-hailing to be available to half the U.S. population by year's end, pending regulatory approval.

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, ruling that federal guidelines on grand jury secrecy prevent their release. This decision came shortly before reports emerged that President Trump had been informed his name appears in the Epstein files, although being named is not evidence of wrongdoing. The ruling complicates the administration's public push for transparency on the matter, while a separate request to unseal records in New York remains pending.</p>

The term's simplicity and versatility allowed it to spread globally, becoming one of the most widely understood words.

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted a temporary order allowing President Trump to fire, without cause, three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) who were appointed by the previous administration. This action challenges a 90-year-old legal precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects the independence of certain regulatory agencies by limiting the president's power to remove officials except for specific wrongdoing. The fired commissioners had sued, arguing their removal was unlawful, and a lower court had initially blocked their termination. The decision, with the court's three liberal justices dissenting, signals a potential shift in presidential power over independent agencies.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's Inspector General has reportedly obtained evidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared information derived from a classified email in an encrypted Signal chat group. The messages, which detailed a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen, were sent to several Trump administration officials. This contradicts previous administration denials that any classified information was shared in the chat, which became public after a reporter was accidentally added. The information allegedly came from an email marked "SECRET//NOFORN," meaning its disclosure could cause serious damage to national security.</p>

          <p>The recent viral incident where a CEO and his subordinate were caught on a concert Jumbotron, sparking affair allegations, highlights modern concerns about privacy in the digital age. The article explores how easily personal moments can become public spectacles, amplified by social media, online sleuths, and even corporate brands. This phenomenon, termed "panopticontent," normalizes the surveillance of strangers and blurs the lines between public and private life. While often used to expose wrongdoing, this trend also raises ethical questions about a culture where everyone is at risk of becoming a main character online without their consent.</p>

          <p>Earth Overshoot Day, the date when humanity has used all the biological resources that the planet can regenerate in a year, has arrived on July 24, over a week earlier than in 2024. According to the Global Footprint Network, this acceleration is mainly because oceans are absorbing less CO2 than previously thought. The trend of overconsumption, which began in the 1970s, is visible in deforestation, biodiversity loss, and atmospheric carbon accumulation. The report highlights the disparity in consumption, with high-income nations like Qatar and the U.S. reaching their individual overshoot days months earlier.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles, led by Trump appointee Bill Essayli, is reportedly struggling to secure grand jury indictments against individuals arrested during protests over immigration raids. Despite filing felony cases against dozens, many have been dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors after grand juries refused to indict, an unusually rare outcome. Legal experts and some internal sources suggest the cases may be weak or that prosecutorial priorities are misaligned with the community's. The difficulties raise questions about the office's effectiveness as Essayli's interim appointment period nears its end.</p>

Abrego Garcia, who was charged with human smuggling, was previously deported in what the administration called an "administrative error," despite a court order protecting him.

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City was a pivotal moment that fundamentally changed how the U.S. responds to missing children cases. The case led to the end of mandatory waiting periods for filing missing person reports and spurred the creation of national coordination systems and registries. It also marked a cultural shift, popularizing the concept of "stranger danger" and leading to the famous missing children milk carton campaigns of the 1980s. The case is back in the news as the man convicted of Patz's murder was granted a new trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "corn sweat" refers to the significant amount of moisture released into the air by vast fields of corn through a process called evapotranspiration. During hot, sunny weather, this process can dramatically increase humidity, making heat waves in the Midwest feel more oppressive and dangerous, with heat indexes soaring. While a natural process, the massive scale of corn monoculture in the region contributes to extreme humidity. This heightened humidity can offset any cooling effect from the plants and prevents temperatures from dropping significantly at night, exacerbating the risks of heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account would generate more interest on a $10,000 deposit in the current economic climate. While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility, its variable interest rate is likely to decrease if the Fed cuts rates later in the year. A 6-month CD, however, provides a guaranteed fixed rate, which, based on current offerings, would likely earn slightly more interest over the term. The analysis concludes that for savers who can afford to lock away their funds, a CD offers a more predictable and potentially higher return. (not investment advice)</p>
