          <p>Asia-Pacific stock markets experienced a rise on Monday, influenced by China's decision to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, aligning with market expectations. This stability comes ahead of key economic data releases from China, including anticipated third-quarter GDP figures which analysts predict will show a slowdown to 4.8%. The positive market opening in Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong reflects a cautious optimism despite broader concerns about China's economic trajectory. US markets also closed higher on Friday, digesting a softening stance on trade talks with China.</p>

          <p>Bereaved families in the UK are demanding a public inquiry into the government's alleged "repeated failures" to protect vulnerable individuals from a website promoting suicide. A report by the Molly Rose Foundation claims authorities received 65 warnings about such online forums but did not act, linking at least 133 deaths to a toxic chemical promoted by these sites. Families have written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, emphasizing the need for an inquiry to address ignored warnings from coroners and campaigners. The government stated sites must prevent illegal content or face fines, while Ofcom took action leading to a geo-block on the main forum.</p>

          <p>Erez Reuveni, a former Justice Department lawyer, claims he was fired for refusing to sign a brief containing false information in the mistaken deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He alleges that DOJ leadership, including Emil Bove, disregarded court orders and suggested misleading judges to facilitate mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Reuveni, who previously defended Trump's immigration policies, filed a whistleblower complaint, asserting that such actions undermine the rule of law and due process. This article highlights broader concerns about the department's conduct, with a Supreme Court ruling later affirming due process rights for those deported under the act.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking a shift from two decades of leftist rule. The election occurred as Bolivia faces its worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a US dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Both Paz and his conservative opponent, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on promises to stabilize the economy, pivot away from populist policies, and attract foreign investment. Paz aims to tackle corruption and the black market while gradually phasing out fuel subsidies, seeking to avoid an IMF loan.</p>

          <p>This article examines how China's Five Year Plans have profoundly reshaped the global economy and geopolitical landscape over decades. It highlights three key periods: Deng Xiaoping's "reform and opening up" in the 1980s, which led to China becoming a manufacturing powerhouse and the "China shock" for Western jobs; the 2011-2015 focus on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, granting China a near monopoly on rare earth supply chains; and Xi Jinping's current emphasis on "high quality development" to challenge US tech dominance. The article explains how these plans systematically direct state resources towards predefined national goals with significant international repercussions.</p>

This article highlights that an alternative qualification will also be introduced to reduce the number of students resitting maths and English GCSEs.
