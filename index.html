          <p>A Belgian festival has canceled a performance by the Munich Philharmonic because its designated conductor, Lahav Shani, is also the music director of the Israel Philharmonic. The Flanders Festival Ghent cited an inability to get clarity on Shani's stance regarding the Israeli government's actions in Gaza. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from Germany's Culture Minister and the orchestra itself, who labeled it a "cultural boycott" and an attack on democratic values, especially noting the orchestra had previously dropped a Russian conductor over the Ukraine invasion.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly urged the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil, a move aimed at further pressuring Russia's economy. The proposal has been met with skepticism in Europe, as officials are wary of escalating trade tensions with key global partners and note the EU's own ongoing, though reduced, energy trade with Russia. Analysts suggest the EU is unlikely to agree, viewing it as an attempt by the U.S. to shift responsibility for sanctions enforcement while pursuing its own trade deals.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool defender Andre Wisdom has opened up about the lasting physical and emotional impact of being stabbed during a robbery in 2020. The attack left him with severe nerve damage and persistent pain, which he believes altered the trajectory of his professional career. Despite returning to play for Derby County shortly after, he never regained his peak form and now plays for the semi-professional club FC United of Manchester. Wisdom reflects on the life-changing event with positivity, expressing gratitude for his survival and his continued ability to play football.</p>

          <p>A recent Morgan Stanley report reveals a significant shift in sentiment, with over 90% of surveyed U.S. investors expressing a willingness to increase their exposure to Chinese stocks, the highest level since 2021. This renewed interest extends beyond U.S.-listed equities to the onshore A-share market, driven by China's leadership in sectors like robotics and biotech, as well as efforts to stabilize its economy. While the bank notes that the capital reallocation is just beginning, it suggests a potential reversal of the multi-year retreat from Chinese markets by American funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American pharmaceutical company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, is canceling its planned £1 billion expansion in the United Kingdom, which includes a major research center in London. The company attributed the decision to the UK's failure to adequately invest in the life sciences industry and its undervaluation of innovative medicines. This move, which will result in over 100 job losses, follows similar investment reductions by other pharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca and adds to concerns about the UK's declining competitiveness in the sector, partly influenced by US pressure to onshore investment.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university event is being analyzed as a stark symptom of America's increasingly violent and fractured political landscape.

This incident is part of a disturbing trend of political violence, including recent attempts on Trump's life, prompting concerns that public life itself has become dangerously polarized and corrosive to American democracy.</p>

It details his rise from a teenage activist to the leader of Turning Point USA, an organization that reshaped conservative youth outreach and played a crucial role in mobilizing young voters for Trump. Kirk was not just an activist but a close friend to the Trump family and a key interpreter of MAGA ideology for a new generation, making his assassination a profound and personal loss for the administration and its supporters.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face meeting since February 2024. The 50-minute reunion is being viewed as a small but potentially significant step toward reconciliation after a period of public family conflict. In recent months, Prince Harry has expressed a desire to mend the relationship, and the meeting's quiet arrangement, without leaks from either side, suggests a mutual effort to handle the situation discreetly. However, a full family reconciliation remains distant, as no meeting with Prince William occurred.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three senior FBI officials who were fired last month have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming they were illegally terminated for political reasons. The complaint alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel told one of the agents his job depended on firing individuals involved in past investigations of President Trump, stating the president "hasn't forgotten" the FBI's actions. The lawsuit, brought by decorated veterans of the agency, argues these firings were part of a politically motivated purge intended to punish law enforcement agents for performing their duties impartially.</p>

          <p>A Vietnamese family in San José is contemplating closing their jewelry store after it was targeted in a brazen smash-and-grab robbery. A mob of masked individuals crashed an SUV through the storefront before storming in with hammers and a gun, stealing merchandise in under a minute. The 88-year-old owner was shoved to the floor during the heist and later suffered a stroke, adding to the family's trauma. The incident, captured on video, has sparked outrage and calls from community leaders for increased law enforcement to combat organized retail crime rings.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), democracy has declined globally over the past five years. The study, which analyzed 173 countries, found that more than half showed a decline in at least one key democratic indicator between 2019 and 2024, with significant erosion seen in credible elections, access to justice, and press freedom. While some nations in Europe continue to dominate the top rankings for democratic performance, the overall trend points to a concerning weakening of democratic institutions worldwide.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by real estate company Redfin claims that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a "normal" level, defined as the mortgage payment-to-income ratio seen in July 2018. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with significant wage increases for tech workers, bringing the affordability metric back to its pre-pandemic equilibrium. However, the report clarifies that this does not mean the city is affordable, as San Francisco's 2018 "normal" still required a much higher percentage of income for housing than most other U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny revealed that concerns about potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity outside his concerts influenced his decision to exclude U.S. dates from his latest world tour.

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has collected rock samples from a dried river channel on Mars that contain what scientists are calling potential signs of ancient microscopic life. The samples, from a clay-rich formation, contain organic carbon along with iron phosphate and iron sulfide compounds, which on Earth are byproducts of microbial activity. While researchers stress that non-biological processes could also explain these features, they represent the most compelling candidate so far in the search for extraterrestrial life. Conclusive analysis will require returning the samples to Earth for study in advanced laboratories.</p>

While some residents view the property as a public health hazard, others are defending the homeowner, Raymond Gaon, describing him as a private veteran who meticulously collects and sorts materials for recycling as his source of income. Friends and some neighbors are calling for compassion and understanding, arguing that public shaming is counterproductive for a person they say has hoarding tendencies.</p>

Its innovative asymmetrical design, with a high-speed railway on one side and a road on the other, overcomes significant weight distribution challenges.

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocked the president from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had argued that Cook's reinstatement was in the public interest of maintaining the Federal Reserve's independence and that she had a strong case that her removal lacked legal "cause." President Trump announced his intention to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, a move her lawyers contend is a pretext in a broader campaign to pressure the central bank on interest rates.</p>
