            <p>This article examines how popular podcast hosts, often referred to as the "manosphere," are reacting to President Trump's proposed tariff policies. It highlights a sense of confusion and hesitancy among these influencers, who previously endorsed Trump, regarding the economic implications of tariffs. The article notes that while some hosts express concerns about the stock market and potential harm to small businesses, others are unsure about Trump's rationale. This reaction mirrors the broader American sentiment, indicating that these podcasters serve as a bellwether for public opinion on Trump's economic agenda. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding these reactions, as these podcasters reach a significant audience who may not actively follow traditional news sources.</p>

            <p>President Trump's volatile trade policies are creating new challenges for California's state budget, making revenue predictions more precarious than usual. The state's reliance on income tax from top earners, whose fortunes are tied to the stock market, makes it vulnerable to economic uncertainty. Tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries could hurt California's agricultural industry and tech stocks. The Newsom administration is trying to develop economic forecasts, but the unpredictability of federal policy makes it difficult to build revenue projections.</p>

U.S. investors might be forced to sell nearly $800 billion of Chinese stocks, while China could liquidate $1.3 trillion in U.S. Treasury holdings and $370 billion in equities. The risk of decoupling has increased amid trade tensions, with the U.S. considering delisting Chinese companies trading on American exchanges.

All five commissioners live in or near Sacramento or San Francisco, raising concerns about whether Southern California's needs are adequately considered. Critics point to the commission's decisions to approve requests from utilities despite protests from Southern Californians. A bill has been introduced to require the governor to appoint a commissioner from each of the four regions used by the Board of Equalization.</p>

            <h2>Trump's Presidency: A Shift Towards Kleptocracy</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>This article argues that the Trump administration is marked by a shift towards kleptocratic practices, where personal financial interests are prioritized over the nation's business. Trump's blatant conflicts of interest, such as doing business with foreign entities and promoting his own properties, are seen as a symptom of this larger trend. The article highlights instances of deregulation, suspended investigations, and the dismantling of oversight mechanisms that benefit Trump and his allies. This shift towards opacity and corruption threatens the transparency and accountability of American government.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade policies are inadvertently handing China a strategic advantage by alienating long-standing U.S. allies. The tariffs imposed on countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are pushing them towards closer economic ties with China, which offers a reliable alternative. Trump's actions undermine American power by weakening relationships with key partners in Asia. Furthermore, the article argues that Trump's anti-trade campaign furthers Beijing's goal of gaining control of Taiwan, as the US is now treating its allies and potential allies in the western Pacific region more as economic threats than as strategic partners.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that Atlantic salmon exposed to anti-anxiety medication in rivers are more successful in reaching their destination, likely due to increased boldness. Researchers implanted slow-release drugs in juvenile salmon and tracked their migration, finding that clobazam, an anti-anxiety drug, boosted their success. However, this increased risk-taking could have negative long-term consequences for the population. Scientists have detected numerous drug ingredients in waterways worldwide, raising concerns about their impact on aquatic species.</p>
