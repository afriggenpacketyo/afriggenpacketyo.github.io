          <p>Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth has ordered hundreds of generals and admirals to an unusual meeting at Marine Corps University, causing unease within the military. The agenda is officially undisclosed but is rumored to focus on instilling a "warrior ethos" and aligning leadership with the Trump administration's new posture for the rebranded Department of War. This move follows recent firings of senior officers and has been described by some retired generals as performative and concerning, with one drawing a parallel to a 1935 loyalty oath ceremony in Nazi Germany. The abrupt and widespread summons has raised questions about potential further dismissals or a significant shift in military policy.</p>

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy recently described his late father, actor Jack Cassidy, as a "phony" who was more focused on his public persona than on being a parent. In an interview, Cassidy explained that he and his brothers saw through their father's fabricated, theatrical accent and showmanship, which created a complicated family dynamic. Despite the pain of an absent father who was also resentful of his success, Cassidy acknowledges the positive gifts he received from him. He also reflected on growing up largely unsupervised in Hollywood alongside other celebrity children, fostering a sense of mutual support and survival.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, the first Black woman to be hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Breaking barriers in the 1960s, she became a trusted and unflappable voice in Bay Area journalism, covering pivotal events like the Harvey Milk assassination and the AIDS crisis for stations like KPIX and KQED. Despite facing overt racism and sexism, Davis remained dedicated to her craft, earning eight regional Emmy Awards and mentoring a generation of journalists. Colleagues and public figures remember her as a trailblazer who opened doors for women and people of color in media.</p>

This asset class, which has seen significant growth, was historically available only to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The new fund provides indirect exposure through publicly traded business development companies (BDCs), offering a liquid alternative without the typical high fees and lockup periods of traditional private credit. The strategy is designed to provide retail investors with a new source for potential income streams from this expanding market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has publicly addressed Berkshire Hathaway's complete divestment of its shares, framing the move as a normal part of investing. A company executive thanked Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for their 17 years of support, noting that Berkshire Hathaway's business is to buy, earn, and sell. Despite the calm corporate response, BYD's shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong this week amid signs of cooling growth, including a recent cut to its 2025 sales target.

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have resulted in at least 44 deaths across Gaza, including nine members of one family, according to local health officials. The attacks continue as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN, stating his intention to "finish the job" against Hamas despite growing international calls for a ceasefire. Hospitals in the region are reportedly on the brink of collapse due to the ongoing offensive and shortages of essential supplies. The violence persists while diplomatic efforts, including a planned meeting between Netanyahu and U.S. President Trump, are underway to negotiate an end to the fighting.</p>

          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, just hours after sacking Graham Potter. Potter was dismissed after only eight months, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table following a poor start to the season. Nuno, who was recently let go by Nottingham Forest despite leading them to a high league finish last season, is seen as a manager who can bring stability and a competitive edge. His appointment marks a shift in managerial style for the club, with some commentators noting his approach is more akin to former manager David Moyes.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating the party's policies "will tear this country apart" as he arrived for the Labour party conference. He specifically highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as one of its most "shocking" ideas, arguing it would affect long-term residents contributing to British society. Starmer positioned the conference as an opportunity to present Labour's vision of "patriotic national renewal" as a clear alternative to what he termed Reform's politics of "divide and decline."

          <p>Global consulting firm Accenture has announced plans to "exit" employees who are unable to adapt and retrain for roles centered on artificial intelligence. CEO Julie Sweet stated that as AI becomes integral to all company operations, employees are expected to retool, and those for whom reskilling is not a "viable path" will be let go on a compressed timeline. This move is part of an $865 million business optimization program aimed at reinvesting over $1 billion into the company's AI capabilities and talent. Despite the cuts, Accenture is also actively hiring, having increased its AI and data professionals from 40,000 in 2023 to 77,000 in 2025.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the Labour Party back to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing significant internal criticism and questions about his suitability for the job. Senior figures within the party have privately expressed concerns about his slow decision-making, flawed judgment on policy and personnel, and inability to communicate a clear vision to the public. The party's poor performance in opinion polls has fueled frustration, with speculation about a potential leadership challenge. As the party conference begins, Starmer is under immense pressure to reassert his authority and articulate a compelling story for the country to quell the growing dissent.</p>

          <p>Iran has recalled its ambassadors from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in a significant diplomatic move. The action followed the failure of a UN Security Council resolution, which was backed by China and Russia and aimed to block the reimposition of global sanctions on Tehran. The resolution was defeated with nine votes against, including from the three European nations.

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power across Africa through its network of government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. These institutes, now present in 49 African countries, offer language courses and scholarships, attracting students who see it as a path to economic opportunity. However, critics raise concerns about the institutes' role in spreading Chinese political ideology and interfering with academic freedom at host universities. Some analysts argue that this cultural expansion is intertwined with China's economic goals, including securing access to the continent's vast natural resources like lithium and cobalt.</p>

          <p>Denmark's defense ministry has reported multiple drone sightings over several military facilities, including the country's largest airbase in Karup. This is the latest in a series of incidents this week that have caused airspace closures and heightened security concerns across the Nordic region and Germany. Earlier in the week, drones forced the temporary shutdown of airports in Copenhagen, Aalborg, and Billund, with similar sightings reported near military sites in Norway. While Danish authorities have not officially assigned blame, the coordinated and suspicious nature of the activity has sparked fears of a potential "hybrid attack" amid regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old Miami girl named Imani Dell was diagnosed with a fast-growing brain tumor after her aunt observed that her eyes were crossed. Her mother, initially thinking it was due to tablet use, rushed her to the hospital when Imani began seeing double. A CT scan revealed a golf-ball sized medulloblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor common in children, which had caused fluid buildup in her brain. After successful surgery to remove the mass, Imani endured 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the past year and has now finished her treatment and returned to school.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots more time to react and prevent dangerous runway collisions. The technology was demonstrated by recreating recent near-disasters, showing how automated warnings like "Traffic on runway!" can avert accidents. This development comes in response to a rise in serious runway incursions at U.S. airports, which prompted safety experts to call for more advanced cockpit technology. The new system uses GPS data to provide alerts seconds earlier than existing systems, which could be critical in preventing collisions during takeoff and landing.</p>

After successfully pressuring ABC to suspend Kimmel, the affiliates overplayed their hand by refusing to air his return, effectively starting a game of chicken they were bound to lose. The boycott was more costly for the local stations, which lost viewers and ad revenue, than for ABC's parent company Disney, whose viewers could find the show on streaming platforms. The affiliates' quick reversal underscored that despite their consolidated power, they remain dependent on networks for valuable content like live sports.</p>

          <p>The principle of free speech, which protects even offensive and hateful expression, is a cornerstone of American democracy that remains highly relevant today. This idea was famously tested in 1977 when the ACLU defended the right of a neo-Nazi group to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors. The ACLU lawyer, David Goldberger, argued that the real client was the First Amendment itself, because if speech can be denied for being offensive, officials gain the power to silence any expression they dislike. While acknowledging the real pain such speech can cause, the piece concludes that the principle is a unifying concept in divided times.</p>

          <p>Legal experts believe that President Trump's long history of public attacks against former FBI Director James Comey could jeopardize the federal case against him. Comey was recently indicted on charges of making false statements to Congress, but defense lawyers are expected to argue for dismissal based on selective or vindictive prosecution. The president's repeated calls for Comey's imprisonment, combined with the recent installation of a Trump loyalist to lead the prosecuting office, provide strong evidence of political motivation. The unusual circumstances may give these legal challenges a higher chance of success than is typical.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications could have significant negative consequences for the U.S. economy, according to Wharton economist Britta Glennon. She argues that instead of protecting American jobs, the policy would likely deter skilled immigrants, who are disproportionately responsible for innovation and entrepreneurship, and push companies to offshore jobs. Research shows that past restrictions on high-skill immigration have led to a decline in U.S. patenting and an increase in companies moving operations abroad. While acknowledging some abuses in the program, Glennon suggests targeted reform is needed to avoid damaging America's competitive edge.</p>
