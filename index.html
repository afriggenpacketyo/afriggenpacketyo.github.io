          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set for a final vote on a major spending bill championed by President Donald Trump. The legislation, which extends tax cuts from his first term while cutting social programs, advanced after Republican leaders secured enough support overnight. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delayed the process by delivering the longest floor speech in House history, speaking for nearly nine hours in opposition to the bill's cuts to programs like Medicaid and its potential to increase the national debt by an estimated $3.4 trillion over the next decade.

          <p>President Donald Trump held a nearly hour-long phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, discussing the war in Ukraine. The conversation followed a recent U.S. decision to pause some missile and ammunition shipments to Kyiv, a move that has raised concerns among Ukraine's allies. During the call, Trump reportedly urged an immediate ceasefire, while Putin emphasized a political resolution through negotiations and reiterated Russia's commitment to its military objectives. The pause in U.S. aid comes as Russia intensifies its attacks across Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the tax cuts in the proposed Republican "megabill" would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans, particularly in certain states. The top 1% of U.S. households could see an average tax cut of about $66,000 in 2026. However, in states like Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, which lack a state income tax, the wealthiest residents could see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000, as they benefit from the bill's provisions without being negatively impacted by its cap on state and local tax deductions.

This move follows a recent ruling where the court's conservative majority upheld state bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors.

While the new Syrian leadership has shown some openness, significant obstacles remain, such as Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights.

The article contends that at a time of rapidly rising electricity demand from AI data centers and electric vehicles, this policy will stifle the growth of the cheapest and most readily available new power sources: wind and solar.

          <p>The Madre fire, burning in a rural area of Los Angeles County, has grown to become the largest wildfire in California so far this year. The article provides a helpful glossary of terms used in wildfire reporting to help readers understand the situation. It defines key concepts such as "megafire" (over 100,000 acres), "containment level" (the percentage of the fire's perimeter under control), and "red flag warning" (weather conditions conducive to fire spread). These definitions provide context for understanding the scale and progress of firefighting efforts against this and other major blazes.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, who claim to be intellectual architects of the Trump movement, hold little actual influence over the president or his base. The article uses Trump's decision to strike Iran, which these figures vehemently opposed, as a key example. Polling showed that MAGA Republicans overwhelmingly supported the president's action, demonstrating that "Trumpism" is defined by Trump's own instincts, not by the ideologies of pundits who are merely opportunistic entrepreneurs trying to attach their own agendas to his brand.</p>

          <p>As families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision is whether to use federal or private student loans. For the upcoming year, federal undergraduate loans will have a fixed rate of 6.39%, while some private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit. While private loans can offer significant savings for those who qualify, they lack the robust borrower protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Experts advise that federal loans are a smart first step, but comparing private offers is worthwhile for qualified borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
