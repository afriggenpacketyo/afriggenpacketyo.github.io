          <p>A large wildfire southeast of Athens has resulted in the death of an elderly man and caused significant destruction, leading to widespread evacuations. Fanned by strong winds, the blaze has proven extremely difficult to contain, with authorities issuing emergency alerts for residents in seven areas to leave their homes. Over 190 firefighters, supported by international crews and aircraft, are battling the flames which have now spread into a pine forest. Another major fire has also broken out in western Greece, further straining emergency services and highlighting the severe risk across the country.</p>

          <p>Famed astronaut Jim Lovell, best known for commanding the Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell's leadership during the 1970 mission, which suffered an in-flight explosion, was crucial in safely returning the crew to Earth, turning a potential disaster into what is known as a "successful failure." He also served as the command module pilot for Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the Moon. His family and NASA remembered him for his calm strength, unshakeable optimism, and for inspiring millions.</p>

His remarks come as Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes, was transferred to a minimum-security prison camp. Markus declined to comment on the specifics of the case but emphasized the rewarding nature of being a criminal defense lawyer. The article notes that federal officials deny any preferential treatment in Maxwell's prison transfer, attributing it to safety concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve an occupation of Gaza City is heavily influenced by his reliance on hard-right coalition partners. This move is reportedly opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the public, who fear it will become a strategic trap and lead to more casualties. The article argues that Netanyahu's political survival depends on appeasing these far-right factions, whose ultimate goal is the annexation and resettlement of Gaza. This dynamic creates a significant gap between the government's actions and the desires of the Israeli populace.</p>

Trump indicated that a potential peace deal would likely involve "some swapping of territories" for the benefit of both nations. This development comes as a deadline he set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire approaches, with the administration having threatened secondary sanctions. Reports suggest a deal could formalize some of Russia's territorial gains, a politically sensitive proposition for Ukraine, but one that some European leaders seem cautiously optimistic about.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chain Wendy's has lowered its full-year sales outlook, citing increased competition and economic uncertainty that is causing its customer base, particularly lower-income consumers, to pull back on spending. Executives noted that when consumers choose to eat at home to save money, breakfast is often the first meal to be cut, a trend that has negatively impacted performance. While competitors like McDonald's have successfully used value menus to attract customers, Wendy's is now re-evaluating its own pricing and marketing strategies to better communicate its value offerings.

Authorities say Brown killed four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda before fleeing into the nearby mountains. The governor and attorney general praised the extensive law enforcement effort that led to his apprehension. The article notes that Brown, an Army veteran, had known mental health issues, and community members described him as unstable, expressing their grief for the four victims who were well-regarded locals.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, an independent Member of Parliament in the UK, admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants."

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, throwing out a lower court's criminal contempt order related to the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case originated when a district judge, James Boasberg, found that officials had violated his order to halt the removal of migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The 2-1 appellate decision represents a significant victory for the administration, with the majority opinion stating the lower court's finding raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions" like foreign policy. A dissenting judge argued that defying court orders undermines the judicial system.</p>

          <p>Health officials in China's Guangdong province are implementing a large-scale response to the largest chikungunya virus outbreak in the country's history, which has sickened over 8,000 people. The mosquito-borne virus causes fever, rash, and severe joint pain. In response, authorities are fogging streets with insecticide and taking other measures reminiscent of COVID-19 tactics to control the mosquito population and isolate infected individuals. Because the virus is not typically found in China, the population has no existing immunity, prompting the aggressive public health measures.</p>

          <p>Shares for the ad-tech company The Trade Desk experienced their worst day on record, falling 39% in a single day. The dramatic drop was triggered by the unexpected announcement of its CFO's departure and growing investor anxiety about increased competition from Amazon's advertising platform. While the company's quarterly earnings beat expectations, analysts expressed concern that Amazon's growing dominance in the digital ad market could erode The Trade Desk's value proposition over time. The company's stock is now down 54% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The practice of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arresting individuals at criminal courthouses is reportedly creating a chilling effect on the justice system. Lawyers and prosecutors state that this tactic, which has increased under the Trump administration, discourages not only defendants but also victims and witnesses from appearing in court. This fear can pressure defendants into taking plea deals and prevent victims from testifying or seeking protective orders. Legal experts worry this erodes trust and obstructs the judicial process, potentially delaying or denying justice.</p>

          <p>Salad chain Sweetgreen saw its shares fall by 23% after it reduced its 2025 financial outlook for the second time in two quarters. The company attributed the downgrade to a combination of factors, including a poorly performing loyalty program transition, cautious consumer spending, and operational challenges in its stores. CEO Jonathan Neman described the quarter as "really, really rough," noting that only one-third of their restaurants are meeting performance standards. The company now projects negative same-store sales for the full year. (not investment advice)</p>

Other suggestions include walking around during phone calls and tidying one's workspace to care for the environment where ideas are formed. The article emphasizes working with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them, integrating these small movements as a natural part of creative work.</p>

          <p>Some economists are warning that President Trump's new tariffs on trade partners could increase the risk of stagflation, a period of low economic growth combined with high inflation. The concern is that businesses will pass the costs of the import duties on to consumers, fueling price hikes, while also potentially scaling back hiring to absorb the costs. With U.S. GDP growth already forecast to slow, the tariffs introduce further uncertainty. The White House has dismissed these concerns, while the Federal Reserve faces a challenging situation of being pulled in two directions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The "Make America Healthy Again" movement's crackdown on synthetic food dyes has led many companies to phase out additives like Red 40 and Yellow 5. However, one common dye, titanium dioxide, which makes food white, is often excluded from these corporate pledges. While the EU has banned it over potential health concerns, U.S. food makers argue it is distinct from other dyes and difficult to replace without affecting product appearance and texture. This creates an asterisk in the food-dye crackdown, as the chemical, which is not always clearly labeled, may remain in many products.</p>
