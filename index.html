          <h2>Church Asylum Requests in Germany Surge Amidst Deportation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 10:57:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) reports a significant increase in asylum requests, nearly quadrupling in some areas, driven by growing fears of deportation among refugees. While churches have a long-standing tradition of providing temporary shelter, the high demand means many requests cannot be granted, leaving refugees vulnerable. The incoming government plans to increase deportations, adding to the insecurity. Churches offer a chance for asylum cases to be reevaluated, particularly in Dublin cases where asylum was first sought in another EU country, but the practice faces growing criticism and potential police intervention.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he will not reduce tariffs on China without receiving something "substantial" in return, emphasizing the need for China to open its markets further to U.S. businesses and products. Trump expressed frustration that a previous deal, which would have allowed the U.S. to sell its products more freely in China, was abandoned by the Chinese. He indicated that he might not even pursue the deal, as China seems unwilling to fully open its markets. These comments were made during a press briefing on Air Force One, highlighting the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on President Gerald Ford's decision to welcome 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees and asylum-seekers to the U.S. in 1975, despite public opposition and high unemployment rates. Ford argued the U.S. had a "profound moral obligation" to those who supported the alliance with America. The refugees eventually became successful contributors to American society, including federal judges and an Oscar-winning actor, Ke Huy Quan. The article suggests Ford's leadership demonstrated compassion, political courage, and moral clarity, qualities that are needed today amid current debates about immigration.</p>

          <p>With the NFL Draft concluded, Aaron Rodgers' options for the 2025 season appear to be dwindling, with the Pittsburgh Steelers emerging as the most likely destination. The Minnesota Vikings' acquisition of Sam Howell signals their commitment to J.J. McCarthy, seemingly eliminating them as a potential landing spot for Rodgers. The Steelers' draft strategy, prioritizing positions other than quarterback early on, suggests confidence in their ability to sign Rodgers, who has expressed interest in joining the team. The decision ultimately rests with Rodgers, who could also choose to retire.</p>

          <p>While some tech companies are pausing data center projects, the AI data center market remains robust overall, driven by strong demand for AI deployments. This pause is more of a strategic reallocation amid evolving market dynamics, power constraints, and geopolitical factors, rather than a sign of a bust. Major players like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon are still planning significant investments in AI infrastructure. Power availability is a key factor, as new data centers require substantial electricity, and utilities face challenges in keeping up with demand.</p>

          <p>Despite challenges from the Trump administration and supply chain issues, the U.S. wind energy industry is entering a "repowering" era as older turbines reach the end of their lifecycles. This involves upgrading or replacing aging turbines with more efficient models, increasing electricity output by up to 50%. Repowering existing wind farms offers economic benefits, including avoiding property acquisition costs, but faces potential public opposition and permitting hurdles. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from this trend, with revenue increases reported in 2024.</p>

          <p>The war in Gaza has resulted in over 52,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, as Israel continues its offensive following the end of a ceasefire with Hamas. The offensive, launched on March 18, includes daily strikes and the expansion of a buffer zone around Rafah, with Israeli forces controlling approximately 50% of the territory. The territory is sealed off from imports, including food and medicine, leading to widespread malnutrition. Israel claims the offensive aims to pressure Hamas to release hostages, while Hamas demands a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal.</p>
