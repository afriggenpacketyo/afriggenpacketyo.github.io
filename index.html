          <p>Health and beauty chain Bodycare is set to close all its remaining 56 stores after administrators failed to secure a buyer for the business. The closures will result in the loss of 444 jobs, adding to the more than 1,000 people who have lost their jobs since the company first collapsed. Administrators stated that the business was no longer viable due to stock shortages and significant operating costs. Analysts attribute the company's failure to intense competition from larger retailers and an inability to adapt to an evolving market and rising costs.</p>

          <p>Struggling budget carrier Spirit Airlines is planning to furlough approximately 1,800 flight attendants, which constitutes about a third of its cabin crew, as a cost-cutting measure. This decision comes as the airline navigates its second bankruptcy in under a year and seeks to stabilize its business by shrinking its fleet. The company will first offer voluntary furloughs before implementing involuntary ones, which are scheduled to take effect on December 1. The move follows previous furloughs of hundreds of pilots as the airline continues to face significant financial challenges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Trump administration has announced the cancellation of its annual Household Food Security Report, a survey that has tracked hunger and access to nutrition for 30 years. The administration called the report "redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous." Anti-hunger advocates and policy experts criticized the decision, stating the data is critical for shaping policy and that its absence will make it difficult to understand the scale of hunger in America. The move comes after recent policy changes that are expected to leave millions of Americans without food aid.</p>

          <p>An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3 occurred early Monday morning in the San Francisco Bay Area, with its epicenter located near Berkeley. The shaking was felt widely across the region, waking many residents just before 3 a.m. and prompting thousands to report the event to the U.S. Geological Survey. While the quake caused some initial alarm and minor transit delays for safety inspections, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The event serves as a reminder of the seismic risks inherent to the region.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Expected to Announce Unproven Link Between Tylenol Use in Pregnancy and Autism</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to assert that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, increases the risk of autism when used during pregnancy. This claim is being made despite the fact that extensive scientific research has not established a conclusive causal link. The announcement is part of a broader pattern of the administration questioning established science on various health topics. Mainstream medical groups continue to recommend acetaminophen as the safest option for treating fever and pain in pregnant women, warning that untreated fever poses its own significant risks to a pregnancy.</p>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a case for aggressively cutting the central bank's benchmark interest rate. He argued that current policy is overly restrictive and that factors like tax changes, easing rental costs, and deregulation allow for a reduction of nearly two percentage points. Miran's stance places him as a significant outlier on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the sole dissenter in the recent vote for a smaller quarter-point cut. He contends that holding rates too high risks unnecessary harm to the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, a powerful storm equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, has made landfall in the northern Philippines, bringing destructive winds gusting up to 285km/h (177mph). Thousands of people have been evacuated from the remote Babuyan Islands, where the storm first hit. Authorities have issued warnings for life-threatening storm surges, widespread flooding, and landslides, prompting the closure of schools and government offices across large parts of the country. The typhoon is expected to continue its path west, posing a threat to southern China and Hong Kong later in the week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for each new H-1B visa application, a dramatic increase from the previous fee structure. The H-1B program allows U.S. companies to employ highly skilled foreign professionals in specialty occupations, particularly in the technology and finance sectors. According to the White House, the substantial fee will apply only to new applicants in the upcoming lottery cycle and not to current visa holders or renewals. This policy change is expected to significantly impact companies that rely on the program to fill technical roles.</p>

          <p>This article provides scientific context regarding the causes of autism, countering claims that it can be linked to a single factor like a common painkiller. Experts explain that autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with a strong polygenetic basis, meaning hundreds or thousands of gene variants contribute to the risk, rather than one specific cause. The rise in diagnoses over recent decades is largely attributed to broader diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and better screening methods. The scientific consensus remains that there is no link between vaccines and autism.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk describes the event as a mixture of a Christian religious revival and a conservative political rally. The article highlights the contrasting tones of the speakers, particularly the message of forgiveness from Kirk's widow, Erika, versus the confrontational and retributive rhetoric from figures like Donald Trump and Stephen Miller. The event, which drew tens of thousands, showcased the deep integration of Christian nationalism within the MAGA movement and offered a glimpse into its potential future direction, which appears to be one of escalating political and cultural conflict.</p>
