          <p>Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, has clarified that his recent comments suggesting he might quit were a result of an emotional reaction following a surprising EFL Cup loss to Grimsby. Amorim stated that his remarks about hating his players or wanting to leave are part of his passionate nature and that he needs to improve his handling of such situations. Despite the controversy and the team's winless start to the season, he reportedly maintains the backing of the club's ownership. The manager affirmed his commitment to his authentic, emotional style, even if it invites speculation about his future at the club.</p>

He was secretly transferred by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to a detention camp at Fort Bliss, Texas, and has since been moved again. His lawyers describe the constant relocations as a form of retribution for his speaking out against the harsh conditions in detention, which he termed a 'living hell.' Despite having signed an agreement for deportation to escape the conditions, Rivas Velásquez remains in custody, highlighting the severe challenges faced by detainees within the U.S. immigration system.</p>

The list guides government investment, tax incentives, and permitting decisions for mining and material recovery projects. By identifying minerals vulnerable to supply disruptions from geopolitical events, the U.S. government seeks to enhance national security and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Constitutional Court's removal of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra for ethics violations, Thailand's political landscape faces significant uncertainty. The ruling coalition, led by her Pheu Thai party, now holds a narrow majority, raising concerns about governmental stability and the potential for new elections or even military intervention. Potential successors include Pheu Thai's Chaikasem Nitisiri or figures from conservative factions, which could further alter the country's political direction. The dismissal is a major blow to the influential Shinawatra dynasty, though the family's patriarch, Thaksin Shinawatra, recently secured a legal victory, suggesting their political influence may not be entirely extinguished.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys have traded star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, a move that has stunned teammates and football fans alike. The trade, which includes multiple first-round draft picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark, came after a breakdown in contract negotiations with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Parsons reportedly received a record-breaking four-year, $188 million extension from the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. Fellow Cowboys players, including CeeDee Lamb and Trevon Diggs, publicly shared their surprise and disappointment, while Parsons released a statement thanking Cowboys fans and confirming the move.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's legal team has formally requested a judge to deny Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's motion for a temporary restraining order that would prevent her termination. The administration's court filing asserts that the president has the authority to remove a Fed governor for 'cause' and that his judgment on the matter is not subject to judicial review. The move to fire Cook stems from allegations of mortgage fraud, which her lawyer has dismissed as a smear campaign. The Federal Reserve Board has taken no position on the dispute but has requested a prompt ruling to resolve the uncertainty surrounding its leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a proposed regulation to impose fixed time limits on visas for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists, replacing the current system that allows them to stay for the duration of their program or employment. Under the new rule, student and exchange visitor visas would be limited to a four-year period, while journalist visas would be capped at 240 days, with options for extension. This move is part of a broader strategy to tighten legal immigration and increase government oversight of visa holders. Critics argue the proposal creates unnecessary hurdles and mirrors a similar policy from Trump's first term that was later withdrawn.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers following the firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez just one month into her tenure.

Critics, including Republican Senators Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy, have expressed alarm over the political interference in public health and science.

          <p>The Trump administration's AI Action Plan, which prioritizes deregulation and discourages data collection related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, threatens to automate and deepen health-care disparities. By incentivizing developers to use politically sanitized data sets, the policy could embed existing biases against marginalized communities into the AI algorithms that will guide future medical diagnoses and treatments. This approach risks creating a new generation of clinical tools with blind spots similar to past race-based medical calculators, which led to underdiagnosis and unequal care. Critics warn that once these biases are encoded into the infrastructure of medicine, the resulting harms could persist for decades.</p>

While domestic challenges persist, BYD's overseas sales have surged dramatically, with international deliveries increasing by almost 145% year-on-year in the second quarter.

          <p>Median prices for condominiums in the U.S. have decreased by 2.1% over the past year, in contrast to a slight increase in single-family home prices.

Rising costs for Homeowners Association (HOA) dues, insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements can significantly increase the total cost of ownership. Prospective buyers are advised to scrutinize a building's financials to ensure that long-term expenses do not outweigh the initial savings. (not investment advice)</p>

To secure these higher yields, savers should consider online banks, which typically offer better rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. Using online marketplace sites can help compare offers efficiently, and focusing on short-term CDs of one year or less is currently the best approach for finding the highest available rates.

          <p>This article provides an overview of the data tracking project by The Guardian US, which monitors immigration enforcement statistics released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Since Donald Trump took office, his administration has significantly altered immigration policies, leading to a focus on arrests, detentions, and deportations. The data, published bi-weekly by ICE, is archived and analyzed to show trends in enforcement actions over time. The article clarifies the sources for its figures on arrests, detention totals, and removals, providing transparency on how the numbers are calculated and presented to readers.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Britain has issued a stern warning to the UK and Japan, urging them to cease interference in China's internal affairs regarding Taiwan and maritime disputes. The statement was a response to a joint declaration by the British and Japanese defense ministers, which emphasized the importance of peace in the Taiwan Strait and expressed concerns over unilateral actions in the East and South China Seas. Beijing called on both nations to reflect on their 'erroneous words and deeds' and to avoid creating tensions in the Asia-Pacific region. This diplomatic exchange highlights the escalating geopolitical friction over regional security and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Chris DeVille's new book, "Such Great Heights," chronicles the evolution of indie rock during the 2000s, a period when bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse blurred the lines between niche music and the mainstream. The book argues that the internet, through platforms like Napster and blogs like Pitchfork, was instrumental in transforming indie from a local scene into a global cultural phenomenon. While the term 'indie' eventually became a lifestyle brand, its core ethos—valuing artistic exploration and authenticity over commercial polish—left a lasting impact. This idealistic approach to music ultimately influenced mainstream pop, as seen in the work of major artists today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government did not perform its own independent cost analysis before initiating the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, a BBC investigation has found. The Ministry of Local Government based its projection of £2.9 billion in savings on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings or even incur additional costs. Critics, including the District Councils' Network, have expressed astonishment that such a significant reform was undertaken without up-to-date, independent evidence to justify its financial and structural implications.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's elimination of the 'de minimis' rule, which allowed duty-free imports under $800, is set to create significant financial and logistical hurdles for small and medium-sized U.S. businesses. This policy change means millions of daily packages will now be subject to tariffs, leading to increased costs, complex customs compliance, and potential shipping delays. Many international postal services have already suspended U.S.-bound shipments to adapt to the new regulations. Experts warn that small businesses, which often operate on thin margins and relied heavily on the exemption for sourcing and e-commerce, will be disproportionately affected by the sudden increase in trade costs.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that no official Israeli government delegation will be invited to the DSEI UK 2025 defence exhibition in London next month. A government spokesperson cited Israel's decision to escalate its military operations in Gaza as the reason, calling the move 'wrong.' While private Israeli defense companies can still attend, Israel's defense ministry condemned the decision as a 'regrettable act of discrimination' and withdrew its national pavilion. This action reflects the UK's increasingly critical stance on Israel's conduct in the Gaza war and marks a significant diplomatic rift between the two allies.</p>

          <p>Relations between Hungary and Ukraine have become increasingly strained after Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia disrupted Hungary's crucial oil supply. Hungarian officials condemned the attack as a threat to European energy security, and in a retaliatory move, issued an entry ban against the Ukrainian commander who allegedly coordinated the strikes. The incident highlights Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian oil, a reliance that has made it vulnerable to disruptions caused by the ongoing war. While Ukraine maintains the strikes target Russia's war economy, the fallout is exacerbating existing political friction over Hungary's blocking of Kyiv's EU accession talks.</p>

In a statement, Smyth expressed shock at the new allegation and criticized Police Scotland for releasing details that he claims forced him to leave his home.

          <p>An Italian website named Phica, known for posting digitally altered, explicit images of prominent women including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has been shut down following a political outcry. The site, which had been active for two decades with a large user base, faced intense backlash from female politicians and the public for its obscene and sexist content. The closure comes shortly after Meta shut down a similar Italian Facebook group where men shared intimate photos of their partners without consent. Italian authorities have launched an investigation into the website as lawmakers call for new legislation to combat such online platforms.</p>

          <p>India's economy grew by an annual rate of 7.8% in the April-June quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts, driven by strong performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. Despite the robust real GDP figure, nominal GDP growth, which is not adjusted for inflation, slowed, suggesting that lower inflation helped boost the final number. Economists note that while corporate earnings have been strong, the recent implementation of 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian imports is expected to soften growth in the coming quarters. The World Bank and IMF project India's economy will grow around 6.3% for the full fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the storm is remembered as one of the costliest and deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history, causing nearly 1,400 deaths. The catastrophe was severely compounded by the failure of the levee system in New Orleans, which led to at least 80% of the city being flooded. A retrospective look through photographs captures the immense human suffering, the chaotic scenes at the Superdome, and the heavily criticized slow federal response. Decades later, many communities, particularly the predominantly Black Lower Ninth Ward, have yet to fully recover from the widespread destruction and displacement.</p>
