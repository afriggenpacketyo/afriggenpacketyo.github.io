        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doordash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. The announcement coincided with Doordash's first-quarter revenue report, which fell short of expectations, causing shares to drop by about 4%. Revenue was reported at $3.03 billion versus the expected $3.09 billion, while earnings per share were 44 cents adjusted versus the expected 39 cents. The article also mentions that Deliveroo, a British food delivery service, has agreed to a deal with Doordash worth $3.9 billion.</p>

Better Markets criticized the CFTC's decision as a betrayal of public interest, threatening the integrity of federal elections and casting the CFTC in the role of election supervisor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor in the first round of parliamentary voting, falling short of the required majority with only 310 of 630 members of parliament voting in his favor. This unexpected setback has led to a halt in the parliamentary session for discussions on next steps, causing the German Dax stock market index to decline. Despite the initial failure, Merz is still expected to eventually be elected chancellor in a second vote, which must take place within 14 days, according to the German constitution. Analysts suggest that this unprecedented failure might initially damage his domestic and international authority.</p>

The inquiry follows a CBS News report revealing that the Justice Department halted grant funding to nearly 400 nonprofit and crime victims' groups, citing that the programs did not "effectuate" Justice Department priorities. Democrats are demanding information on the decision-making process and questioning whether the cuts were influenced by Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiatives.

          <p>Several major consumer companies, including Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands, are reporting a slowdown in sales among Hispanic consumers in North America, citing concerns over immigration policies and broader economic uncertainties. This pullback is affecting spending on a range of products from beer to non-alcoholic beverages. While Hispanic consumers generally spend more on consumer packaged goods, stricter immigration enforcement and economic worries are leading to fewer shopping trips and lower spending per trip, prompting companies to adjust their strategies to win back this demographic.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, despite being widely expected to become Germany's next chancellor, failed to secure enough votes in the initial parliamentary ballot. This article explores Merz's background, politics, and the challenges he faces in uniting lawmakers and confronting the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). While supporters praise his intellect and potential, critics point to his tendency to break promises and lack long-term planning, contributing to his recent setback.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the US, China has largely refrained from significantly de-dollarizing its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and weakening the yuan is a more likely response to trade tensions than selling US Treasury holdings. The advisory firm also noted that there are few high-grade and liquid foreign assets to park China’s US$3.2 trillion official foreign exchange reserves.</p>
