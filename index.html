          <p>During a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, President Trump announced his intention to visit China early next year. This planned visit comes amid an escalating trade war, with the President having recently threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports by November if a deal is not reached. Despite the threat, Trump expressed optimism about reaching an agreement, noting that China has been respectful and is paying significant amounts in tariffs. The President also confirmed he still plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Following a recent brazen, daylight robbery of crown jewels, this article details the extensive history of thefts at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The most famous incident was the 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa, which paradoxically catapulted the painting to global fame after its recovery two years later. Other significant heists include the 1976 theft of King Charles X's diamond-studded sword and various other robberies of paintings and artifacts throughout the 20th century. The article connects these historical security breaches to ongoing issues at the museum, such as overcrowding and disrepair, which continue to pose risks to its invaluable collection.</p>

          <p>A significant data breach at two AI companion apps, Chattee Chat and GiMe Chat, has exposed over 43 million private messages and hundreds of thousands of personal images and videos. Cybersecurity researchers at Cybernews discovered that the developer, Imagime Interactive Limited, left a server completely unsecured, allowing real-time access to intimate conversations. The leak affected approximately 400,000 users, mostly in the United States, exposing their IP addresses and device identifiers. This incident highlights severe privacy vulnerabilities in the growing AI companion industry and the potential for exposed data to be used for blackmail or identity theft.</p>

          <p>Kevin Federline, the ex-husband of Britney Spears, is set to release a memoir titled "You Thought You Knew," which contains new allegations about their relationship and her behavior as a mother. In the book, Federline accuses Spears of substance use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, and describes unsettling behavior that he claims frightened their sons. He also expresses continued concern for her well-being and explains his support for her since-terminated conservatorship. Spears has publicly condemned the book, accusing Federline of attempting to profit from her name and describing the claims as hurtful and exhausting.</p>

          <p>England's head coach, Steve Borthwick, has expressed high praise for Leicester back row player Emeka Ilione, who has been included in a national team training camp. Borthwick highlighted the 23-year-old's power, versatility, and intelligence, particularly his ability to win turnovers with minimal penalties and carry the ball effectively in tight spaces. Ilione's inclusion comes as England shifts focus from Tom Willis, who is moving to a French club and will become ineligible for selection. The coach's comments signal a strategic investment in developing new talent for the national squad with an eye on the next World Cup.</p>

The Police Commissioner stated that officers should not be policing "toxic culture war debates," and the new policy is intended to reduce ambiguity. Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not constitute a criminal offense.</p>

One study showed a cannabis oil blend provided better pain relief and caused fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to opioids over a six-month period. Another trial found the same cannabis tincture outperformed a placebo, although experts note the effect size was modest. These findings are considered significant due to the difficulty of conducting such large-scale cannabis research in the U.S., where it remains a Schedule 1 drug, and could influence future pain management practices.</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs surged after the company announced it is exploring rare earth mineral mining at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. The move aligns with a broader U.S. national strategy to achieve independence in critical materials, as China currently dominates the global rare earth supply chain. Amid escalating trade tensions and new Chinese export controls, investors are speculating on government support for domestic mining operations, boosting stocks in the sector. This article highlights the geopolitical and financial significance of developing a U.S.-based rare earth supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's upcoming five-year plan is expected to prioritize industrial policy and investment in high-tech sectors like semiconductors to achieve technological sovereignty amid geopolitical competition with the U.S. This focus comes as the nation's economy faces structural issues, including sputtering export and infrastructure engines and weak domestic consumption. Analysts suggest that while Beijing recognizes the need to boost household spending, its primary financial resources will be directed toward strengthening its manufacturing and technological capabilities. This strategy aims to build economic resilience, even if it means slower progress on rebalancing the economy toward consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the narrative of a "Christian genocide" in Nigeria, a claim amplified by some public figures and organizations but disputed by the Nigerian government and analysts. While acknowledging the severe security crisis and attacks on Christian communities, the article argues the violence is driven by a complex mix of factors, including land disputes, climate change, poverty, and weak governance, rather than a systematic religious extermination. Survivors from both Christian and Muslim communities describe a cycle of retaliatory violence affecting all faiths. The analysis suggests that oversimplifying the conflict as purely religious obscures its root causes and could hinder peacebuilding efforts.</p>

          <p>McVitie's has changed the recipes for its popular Penguin and Club bars, which can no longer be legally described as chocolate biscuits in the UK. Due to soaring cocoa prices caused by poor harvests in West Africa, the manufacturer Pladis reduced the amount of cocoa in the coating, falling below the minimum 20% threshold required for a product to be labeled as milk chocolate. The treats are now described as having a "chocolate flavour coating." The company stated that sensory testing confirmed the new recipe delivers the same taste, highlighting a broader trend of confectioners using cheaper alternatives.</p>

The article outlines the importance of reviewing plans, as changes in coverage for doctors or prescriptions can significantly impact out-of-pocket costs.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated he would attend a proposed meeting in Budapest between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin if he were invited. However, he expressed concern over the choice of Russia-friendly Hungary as the venue and warned against a repeat of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which failed to secure Ukraine's sovereignty. The statement comes as Trump has wavered in his support, recently refusing to provide long-range Tomahawk missiles and suggesting Ukraine should cede territory. Meanwhile, the EU is moving toward phasing out all Russian gas imports to reduce funding for the war.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry has approved the over-the-counter sale of an emergency contraceptive pill for the first time, a significant step for reproductive health access in the country. The manufacturer, ASKA Pharmaceutical, announced that the "morning-after" pill, Norlevo, will be available without a prescription, though it must be taken in the presence of a pharmacist. This move brings Japan in line with over 90 other countries and addresses long-standing criticism from rights groups who argued that prescription requirements created barriers for women, particularly younger individuals and victims of sexual assault. The decision follows a successful trial sale period in 2024.</p>

          <p>A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) caused widespread internet disruptions because it acts as the digital backbone for about a third of the internet. The problem was a common but disruptive Domain Name System (DNS) error, which essentially functions like the internet's address book; when it failed, traffic could not be directed to major sites like Snapchat and Reddit. This article explains that the incident highlights the significant risks of centralizing so much of the internet's infrastructure with a few dominant providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Despite the risks, few alternatives exist at the same massive scale.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that despite a recent drop in homicides, Chicago's violent crime rate remains a severe and often minimized problem, particularly in its Black and Latino communities. The author criticizes politicians who deflect from the issue, pointing out that Chicago's homicide rate is still significantly higher than that of New York or Los Angeles. The article attributes the persistent violence to decades of disinvestment, an ineffective and slow-to-modernize police department, and a political leadership that has tolerated disorder. It highlights the story of a slain officer to illustrate the tragic, personal cost of the city's ongoing public safety crisis.</p>

Top U.S. officials involved in the negotiations, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to help stabilize the agreement. The violence erupted after an attack on Israeli soldiers, which prompted retaliatory Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that killed 45 people. Despite the flare-up, President Trump stated the ceasefire remained in effect, and humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza reportedly resumed.</p>
