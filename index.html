          <p>A 39-year-old man from Norfolk has spoken out after his attacker was sentenced to eight years in prison, two decades after the crime occurred. The man, who waived his anonymity, was inspired to re-report the sexual assault to the police after serving on a jury in 2018. The case highlights the long-term trauma faced by victims, including a diagnosis of complex PTSD, and the challenges of seeking justice years later. He now uses social media to share his experience and support others.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership has introduced a short-term plan to fund the government until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown ahead of the September 30 deadline. The bill includes an additional $30 million for lawmaker security, a response to the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The proposal faces opposition from Democrats, who are pushing for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, creating a potential impasse. The bill requires bipartisan support to pass the Senate, where it needs a 60-vote majority.</p>

          <p>Several individuals, including a sports reporter, a political analyst, and a university employee, have been fired or disciplined for their public comments regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for remarks that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents have sparked a debate about free speech, political violence, and the professional consequences of expressing opinions on controversial events in a polarized climate. These actions highlight employers' increasing sensitivity to being associated with politically charged statements.</p>

According to prepared remarks, she will warn that a newly reconstituted vaccine advisory panel poses a "real risk" to childhood vaccine availability. Monarez claims she was fired for refusing to pre-approve the panel's recommendations and for not dismissing career scientists as directed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Her testimony directly contradicts Kennedy's previous statements to the same committee, escalating the political conflict over the agency's scientific independence.</p>

          <p>The European Chamber of Commerce in China reports that foreign companies are still facing significant restrictions in accessing critical rare earth minerals, with at least one member losing millions of euros as a result. Despite China issuing some single-use export licenses earlier in the year, businesses say the process has become more challenging, creating uncertainty for supply chains. This issue is part of a broader decline in foreign business confidence in China, exacerbated by trade tensions and a sluggish domestic economy. The restrictions highlight Beijing's strategic leverage over these essential materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region fell on Wednesday, following losses on Wall Street as investors cautiously await the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy decision. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all recorded losses. The widespread expectation is that the Fed will announce an interest rate cut, but market participants remain on edge. Additionally, economic data from the region showed a continued plunge in Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, signaling concerns about global demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the fourth consecutive month in August, but the 0.1% year-on-year contraction was less severe than economists had anticipated. The smaller decline was attributed to a rebound in shipments to other parts of Asia, which helped offset a significant 13.8% drop in exports to the United States. Shipments of automobiles to the U.S. continued to fall sharply despite a recent trade deal. This economic data comes ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming rate decision, where it is expected to maintain current interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some landlords in the United Kingdom are selling their rental properties in anticipation of the new Renters' Rights Bill, which introduces significant changes to the private rental sector. The bill aims to enhance tenant security by banning "no-fault" evictions and giving tenants more power to challenge rent increases. While renters' advocates have welcomed the changes as a crucial step for housing security, some landlords express concern that the new regulations will make it harder to manage their properties, potentially leading to a contraction in the rental market and higher rents overall.</p>

          <p>This article questions the notable absence of high-ranking generals leading troop formations during China's recent Victory Day military parade. This contrasts sharply with previous major parades in 2015 and 2019, where dozens of generals visibly participated, a move then described as setting an example for the soldiers. These events have historically offered rare insights into the leadership of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the military does not regularly publicize personnel changes. The lack of generals in the latest parade fuels speculation about the current state and transparency of the PLA's command structure.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Pennsylvania suggests a promising strategy for preventing breast cancer from returning by targeting dormant tumor cells (DTCs). Researchers found that a combination of two drugs, hydroxychloroquine and everolimus, was highly effective at eliminating these lingering cells in patients who had completed initial treatment. In a trial, 100% of participants who took both drugs remained cancer-free after three years. This proactive approach could significantly reduce the high mortality rate associated with recurring breast cancer, offering new hope to survivors.</p>

He used his all-American appeal as a "Trojan horse" to explore the darker, more cynical aspects of the American ideal in films like "The Candidate" and "All the President's Men."

          <p>Authorities report that a 71-year-old man, George Zinn, who was briefly detained after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, has admitted to falsely confessing to the crime. Zinn allegedly shouted that he was the shooter to distract law enforcement and allow the actual gunman to escape. While there is no evidence he colluded with the prime suspect, Tyler Robinson, Zinn is now being held on obstruction of justice charges. Separately, he has also been charged with possession of child sexual abuse material, adding another layer to this side-story of the main investigation.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Outlines Why JPMorgan Could Become a $1 Trillion Company</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that JPMorgan Chase is well-positioned to become the next non-technology company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, joining Berkshire Hathaway. He attributes this potential to the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and its unmatched global reach under the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer notes that the entire banking sector has been performing well, but JPMorgan stands out with its current valuation of around $850 billion. He argues that an expansion of its price-to-earnings multiple is the "real rocket fuel" that could propel it to the trillion-dollar mark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency shows a significant shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a substantial increase from just over 6% a decade ago. The trend is largely attributed to the rise of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that automatics can be easier for learners, potentially improving road safety by allowing drivers to concentrate more on the road.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging that several articles published in 2024 were intended to harm his re-election campaign. The New York Times has called the suit an attempt to stifle independent reporting and stated that it lacks legitimate legal claims. Legal experts believe the lawsuit is almost certain to fail due to the high "actual malice" standard required for a public figure to win a defamation case. This legal action is viewed as part of a broader pattern by Trump to use litigation to intimidate and suppress critical media coverage.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman charged with manslaughter for a fatal crash in El Paso, Texas, was reportedly traveling at 118 mph moments before impact. According to court documents, Marissa Arlene Dominguez admitted to police that she was looking down to select a song on her phone when she rear-ended a motorcycle, killing 48-year-old Alejandro Rodriguez. Crash data from her vehicle confirmed her speed and showed that she did not apply the brakes. Dominguez also admitted to consuming alcohol before the crash, though a breathalyzer test showed she was below the legal limit.</p>

          <p>Strong, gusty winds in Washington state are causing a phenomenon known as ash resuspension, kicking up volcanic ash that has lain dormant since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The area has been experiencing severe drought conditions, leaving the loose ash dry and easily disturbed. This has created hazy skies and reduced air quality, with officials warning that the airborne ash can be hazardous to both human health and aircraft. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not due to any new volcanic activity.</p>

The spacecraft, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies and equipment, was on its way to the station when the malfunctions occurred during orbital adjustment burns. Flight controllers are now working to diagnose the problem and create a new plan to safely guide the Cygnus to the ISS. All other systems on the spacecraft are reported to be functioning normally, but a new arrival date has not yet been set.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic examines the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's murder, noting the irony that his death is being used by some political allies to call for crackdowns on speech. The article argues that while Kirk is being remembered as a proponent of debate, his allies in power are now advocating for censoring dissent and punishing "hate speech." This shift highlights a tension within the MAGA movement, which once championed free speech as a tool to challenge the establishment but now appears to see it as a threat. The author warns that this embrace of censorship is a dangerous departure from democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Two newly elected Labour MPs, Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley, have been denied entry into Israel while on a parliamentary delegation to the occupied West Bank. The MPs, who are both doctors, were planning to visit medical and humanitarian facilities. They were stopped while crossing from Jordan and told they were being denied entry on "public order" grounds. The UK Foreign Office has called the incident "totally unacceptable and deeply concerning," marking the second time this year that British MPs have been barred from entering the region by Israeli authorities.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, in the US temporarily to help build an electric car battery plant in Georgia, were detained in a large-scale immigration raid. Several engineers told the BBC they were handcuffed and chained at their waists and ankles by armed officers, despite believing their short-term visas or visa waivers were valid. They described being held in freezing conditions at a detention center. The incident has caused a diplomatic stir, with South Korean officials investigating potential human rights violations and a US official expressing "deep regrets" over the matter.</p>
