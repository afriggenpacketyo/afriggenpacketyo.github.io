          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified recent U.S. airstrikes in Yemen, stating they aim to disrupt the Iran-backed Houthi rebels' ability to attack global shipping and the U.S. military.  He emphasized that this is not a one-off action but a sustained campaign to neutralize the Houthi threat, asserting that the strikes are "doing the world a favor". The strikes followed months of Houthi disruption of Red Sea transit.</p>
