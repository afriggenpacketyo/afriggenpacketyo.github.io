          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Amidst stock market volatility and rising Treasury bond yields, investors are seeking safe havens. The bond ladder strategy, involving investments across a range of Treasury maturities held until completion, can provide stable monthly income and reduce concerns about short-term price swings. While typically offered to high-net-worth clients, ETFs like the LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) are making this approach more accessible. Investors should note that while this offers stability, hyperinflation or a U.S. Treasury default are potential risks, and the net asset value of these ETFs will fluctuate.

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) argues that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch in foreign relations, responding to a motion for relief by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador. The DOJ asserts that the court cannot order the government to make demands of the El Salvadoran government or extract a citizen from its custody. They contend that the requests involve interactions with a foreign sovereign, potentially violating its sovereignty.</p>

            <p>A report by MPs found that some police forces were unprepared for the level of violence that broke out in riots following the murder of three children in Southport. The report acknowledged the bravery and professionalism of officers who worked tirelessly, but found that forces were unable to act proactively, leaving them exposed. The report found no evidence to support claims of "two-tier policing." The report also outlined the "difficult position" Merseyside Police faced around publishing details around the suspect but added the lack of information created a "vacuum".</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering new tariffs on semiconductors, an essential part of many products from cars to cell phones, after the White House exempted certain electronics from reciprocal tariffs. The administration maintains that semiconductors are critical to U.S. national security and that they must be made in America. Trump and his top trade officials have added to the confusion over his administration's tariff plans by questioning reciprocal exemptions. This move is aimed at encouraging domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly China.</p>
