        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources generated more electricity globally than coal during the first half of 2025, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. This significant milestone was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of solar and wind power, which met all of the world's new electricity demand. While emerging economies like China and India led this green transition, the report noted that the US and EU saw a temporary increase in fossil fuel reliance due to factors like higher demand and unfavorable weather conditions for renewables.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been found guilty of stalking TV and radio presenter Myleene Klass and her colleague Katie Breathwick over a four-year period. The man, Peter Windsor, sent numerous unwanted and alarming items to their workplace, including an air pistol, handcuffs, and a will-writing kit, causing what Klass described as "sheer terror." The court heard that Windsor, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had also sent disturbing letters. He will be sentenced next month, with options including prison or a hospital order.</p>

          <p>Foreclosure filings in the United States have been increasing for six consecutive months, with a notable 18% rise compared to the previous year, according to data from ATTOM. The surge is attributed to the mounting financial strain on homeowners, who are grappling with the high costs of insurance, property taxes, and general living expenses. Unexpected life events like job loss or medical bills are pushing many households, already stretched thin, into mortgage delinquency. While still below pre-pandemic levels, the trend highlights the growing economic vulnerability of many American homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laura Modi, co-founder and CEO of the infant formula startup Bobbie, is working to disrupt a market long dominated by a few major players like Abbott and Reckitt. Motivated by her own frustrating experiences as a new mother, Modi launched Bobbie in 2018 to offer higher-quality, organic products and change the conversation around feeding babies. The company gained significant traction following the 2022 nationwide formula shortage, which exposed the risks of market concentration. Bobbie focuses on a mission-driven approach, advocating for issues like paid family leave to connect with its consumer base.</p>

          <p>As Albania's economy and tourism sector expand, the country is facing a severe waste management crisis that threatens its environment and its path toward European Union membership. The capital, Tirana, generates nearly half of the nation's urban waste, overwhelming its main landfill, while recycling efforts remain minimal across the country. Environmental experts warn that the system is failing, with pollution contaminating rivers and soil.

          <p>Vietnam, long considered a leader in LGBTQ+ rights in Asia, has alarmed activists after authorities in Ho Chi Minh City abruptly canceled a major Pride march and several other related events. While the specific reasons remain unclear, the move is seen by some as part of a broader crackdown on civil society under the country's new leadership. This development contrasts with years of progress, including the health ministry's 2022 declaration that homosexuality is not an illness. Analysts speculate the crackdown could be linked to fears of youth-led protests rather than direct hostility toward the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may find current borrowing costs more affordable due to recent declines in interest rates. A $75,000 HELOC with a 15-year term now costs approximately $712 per month, down from about $777 in August 2024 when interest rates were higher. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even less expensive if the Federal Reserve continues its anticipated rate cuts later this year. This makes them a timely option for those needing financing, as borrowers can benefit from future rate drops without refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine is seeking to increase its natural gas imports by 30% and is in discussions with G7 countries to secure the supply, according to Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk. The move is necessary due to "significant" damage to Ukraine's domestic gas production and transmission facilities caused by targeted Russian airstrikes. In other developments, Finland's president plans to convey messages from his recent Kyiv visit to U.S. President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is awaiting clarity on whether the U.S. will supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles, a move it warns would be a "serious round of escalation."</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed skepticism about his government's new voluntary military service model, suggesting that a return to compulsory service may be necessary. The comments have intensified a national debate as Germany seeks to expand its armed forces to 260,000 active soldiers by the early 2030s in response to new NATO commitments and the threat from Russia. Conscription in Germany was suspended in 2011 but remains in the constitution. Merz's remarks have caused friction within his coalition, particularly with the Social Democrats, who favor the current voluntary approach and have criticized the chancellor for unsettling young people.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues with no clear resolution, analysts suggest the upcoming October 15 military pay date could be a critical "forcing event" for a compromise. The political cost of failing to pay the 1.3 million active-duty service members may be too high for either party to bear, potentially leading to at least a temporary funding bill. According to Goldman Sachs economists, this date represents a key pressure point, as few other specific deadlines exist that could compel Congress and the White House to act. However, prediction markets still indicate a high probability that the shutdown will extend beyond this date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In one of the Vatican's most forceful statements on the conflict, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See's secretary of state, has condemned Israel's military campaign in Gaza as an "ongoing massacre." While also calling the October 7 Hamas attack "inhuman and indefensible," Parolin stated that Israel's right to self-defense must respect the principle of proportionality and that its war disregards a largely defenseless civilian population. The Israeli embassy responded by calling the comments problematic and arguing there is no moral equivalence between the two sides. The sharp criticism reflects a more assertive stance from the Vatican under Pope Leo.</p>

          <p>The recent resignation of France's prime minister has sparked political turmoil, causing the euro to fall and French borrowing costs to spike amid fears over the country's massive sovereign debt. At €3.35 trillion, France holds the most absolute debt in the EU, and its debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest. The political deadlock over how to implement necessary budget cuts to meet EU deficit targets is shaking investor confidence. Economists are now worried that if Europe's second-largest economy cannot control its finances, it could destabilize the entire eurozone, although a short-term crisis is not yet anticipated.

          <p>A new study in Uganda has found that treating baby wraps with insecticide can reduce malaria infections in young children by approximately 65%. Inspired by the U.S. military's practice of treating uniforms, researchers provided 200 mothers with permethrin-soaked wraps for carrying their babies, a common practice in sub-Saharan Africa. The results were "beyond even our wildest expectations," offering a promising new tool to protect children when they are not under a bed net. The intervention, which had minimal side effects, could be a critical new strategy in the fight against a disease that kills a child under five nearly every minute.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A term gaining currency in right-wing circles, "heritage American," is being used to define a specific vision of national identity, often tied to having ancestors in the U.S. during the Civil War and embodying an "Anglo-Protestant spirit." Popularized by figures like Tucker Carlson and columnist Auron MacIntyre, and alluded to by politicians like Vice President J. D. Vance, the phrase raises questions about who is considered a "true" American. Critics argue the term is a strategically vague, more palatable way to advance a nativist or white nationalist agenda, potentially laying the groundwork for restrictive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Some DPD drivers in the UK have started a three-day work action to protest a cut in their payment rates for delivering small parcels. The delivery firm reduced the rate by 65p per stop, a change that one self-employed driver claimed could cost him around £6,500 annually. The dispute involves up to 1,300 drivers who are refusing to work on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. DPD stated it does not expect a "significant impact" on its services, arguing that it has also increased pay for larger parcels and introduced new incentives, keeping its remuneration package competitive.</p>

The recent U.S.-brokered peace proposal, which he was reportedly pressured to accept, now offers him a potential victory, allowing him to claim he defeated Hamas and brought hostages home. Even if the deal fails due to Hamas's rejection, it allows him to argue that he pursued diplomacy before continuing military action.</p>

The administration is reportedly using an obscure federal law, Section 12-406 of Title 10, to claim authority, which allows for deployment in the case of a "rebellion."
