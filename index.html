          <p>A BBC News report details how teenage girls are terrorizing shopkeepers on Shirley High Street in Southampton, engaging in antisocial behavior like smashing windows, stealing items, and threatening staff. Shop owners express feeling helpless due to the teenagers' brazenness and perceived lack of consequences. One 14-year-old girl admits to the behavior, citing it as an adrenaline release. The report also highlights the broader challenge of tackling antisocial behavior and the limitations of current legislation and policing strategies, with local officials and business owners calling for more robust action to address the issue. The situation in Shirley has calmed down in recent weeks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This DW article discusses the possibility of Gulf states forming a NATO-style defense alliance in response to perceived unreliability of the US as a security guarantor, particularly after an alleged Israeli missile attack on Qatar. While a full-fledged "Islamic NATO" is deemed unlikely, the article suggests a "6+2" format involving the Gulf Cooperation Council states plus Turkey and Egypt is being considered to enhance intelligence sharing, missile warnings, and joint military exercises. This shift reflects a growing desire for strategic autonomy and a hedging strategy against over-reliance on the US, with potential for increased defense ties with countries like Russia and China. The US may encourage regional military integration.</p>

          <p>Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China’s largest drug maker, has announced its fifth licensing deal of the year, this time with an Indian partner, Glenmark, to develop and commercialize its cancer drug trastuzumab rezetecan. This agreement grants Glenmark rights in markets excluding China, the US, Canada, Japan, and former Soviet republics, for an upfront payment of $18 million and potential milestone payments up to $1.1 billion. The deal is part of Hengrui’s strategy to leverage overseas partners to bring its new drugs to the global market. This move signals the company's commitment to international collaboration and accelerating the translation of R&D achievements.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro criticized US airstrikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea, calling them an "act of tyranny" and demanding criminal proceedings if Colombians were killed. Petro argued that stopping the boats and arresting the crew would be sufficient, rather than resorting to lethal force. He accused the Trump administration of humiliating his people and asserted that South American nations would not "bow down to the king." The White House defended the strikes, stating that Trump was prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from entering the country.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Lula da Silva stated that Ukrainian President Zelensky is now "more willing to talk" regarding peace negotiations with Russia, as he seeks to revive a joint Brazil-China peace plan. Lula emphasized the importance of the UN taking charge of negotiations and urged Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to form a contact group. This renewed push comes amidst shifting diplomatic winds, with China and Brazil recently endorsing a US-led ceasefire initiative at the Security Council. The original six-point plan included humanitarian access, prisoner exchanges, and civilian protection.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" at the United Nations, citing malfunctions with an escalator, teleprompter, and microphone during his visit.

          <p>Republican lawmakers in US states are blaming Canada for wildfire smoke drifting south, urging an investigation into Canada's wildfire management. Manitoba's premier condemned the move as playing "political games." A study revealed that smoke from Canada's wildfires caused over 87,500 acute and premature deaths worldwide in 2023. Experts argue that climate change is the main driver of worsening wildfires and call for collaboration instead of blame. Both countries have struggled to keep pace, often sharing firefighting resources.</p>

The film depicts the real-life devastation caused by the 2018 wildfires and the difficult decisions made to save lives. Director Paul Greengrass cast McConaughey's family for realism and filmed on an abandoned campus in New Mexico to create a realistic cinematic experience of fire. The film explores themes of human connection and the global dangers of wildfires.</p>

          <p>Orange County officials are investigating whether any dogs or cats are registered to vote after a woman was charged with registering her dog to vote and casting ballots for the pet. The Board of Supervisors directed staff to cross-reference voter rolls with pet registration data. While some supervisors expressed concern about voter roll integrity, others emphasized increasing voter participation. The registrar of voters has found no evidence of pets being registered to vote in unincorporated areas.</p>

          <p>Leaked documents reveal that England's Environment Agency (EA) struggled to monitor serious pollution incidents, failing to send investigators to a third of water industry incidents that posed a threat to nature or human health in 2024. The EA often relied on water companies for updates and downgraded the environmental impact of over 1,000 incidents without on-site investigation. An EA insider criticized the agency for relying on water company evidence, which is rarely damning. Campaigners cited instances where the EA took water company explanations at face value, later proven wrong.</p>

Obama also criticized progressives for becoming complacent and smug in the 90s and 00s, posturing that they believed in values that were never tested.</p>

          <p>A meta-analysis of existing research has found microplastics inside human bones, raising concerns about their impact on bone health. The study revealed that microplastics have been detected in human bone tissue and can affect cell viability, modify gene expression, and trigger inflammatory responses. Experimental animal studies indicated that microplastics ingestion disturbs gut microbiota and reduces white blood cell counts, suggesting compromised bone marrow function. Researchers advocate for further investigation into the causal link between microplastics and bone disease.</p>

          <p>A new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is causing concern in the US tech sector, particularly among startups and smaller firms. The H-1B program is used to hire skilled foreign workers, and the fee could create new burdens for businesses, potentially impacting innovation and economic growth. Some organizations in industries such as education and healthcare, which employ foreign skilled workers through the H-1B program, are also grappling with what the six-figure fee might mean.
