          <p>U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The location was chosen for its historical significance, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, and its geographical proximity. The summit, hosted at a major military base, follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, which have so far been unsuccessful. A potential agreement being discussed reportedly involves significant territorial concessions from Ukraine, a point of major contention for the Ukrainian government.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops and federal agents has begun in Washington D.C. following President Trump's order to address what he terms "out of control" violent crime. Armored vehicles have been positioned at key locations, with officials expecting 800 troops and 500 federal agents to be involved. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has strongly criticized the move as an "authoritarian push," highlighting a significant political clash between local and federal leadership. The deployment coincides with a recent homicide near the White House, although city and federal crime statistics present conflicting narratives on the severity of the crime wave.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of science research grants to UCLA that were abruptly suspended last month. The ruling stated the administration's action violated a previous injunction against terminating such funds, dismissing the government's argument that the freezes were merely "suspensions." This decision affects over a third of the $584 million in federal funding that was frozen due to allegations of antisemitism and discrimination at the university. The legal challenge originated from a class-action lawsuit filed by UC professors, not the university system itself.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation into a new Florida immigration detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," has found that many detainees do not have criminal records, contrary to official claims. The facility was promoted as housing "the worst of the worst," but it holds individuals like DACA recipients who were brought to the U.S. as children and have no criminal history. One such detainee was arrested during a traffic stop and told his DACA status was canceled, highlighting concerns about the administration's shifting enforcement priorities. Federal data shows nearly half of all ICE detainees in June lacked a criminal record.</p>

          <p>A new annual report from the Trump administration's State Department claims the human rights situation in the United Kingdom has "worsened" over the last year. The document specifically cites concerns over restrictions on freedom of expression, such as laws against "hateful" speech and the response to online misinformation following the Southport attacks. It also points to the implementation of buffer zones around abortion clinics, which prohibit protests, as an infringement on speech. The UK government defended its policies, stating it proudly upholds freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Popular rapper and YouTube personality DDG was briefly detained by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies in what he believes was a "swatting" incident. He was at a paintball tournament when law enforcement surrounded him with weapons drawn, based on a false report that he was armed and planning to harm people. DDG described the terrifying experience on a social media stream after being held for approximately 20 minutes and then released. Swatting, the act of making a false emergency report to provoke a large police response, remains a dangerous phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested, a first for a former first lady in the country's history. She faces serious allegations including stock market fraud, accepting bribes, and influence peddling, which she has denied. The charges stem from multiple incidents, including her alleged acceptance of luxury items in exchange for political influence. Prosecutors sought her arrest over concerns she might destroy evidence, adding another layer to the political turmoil following her husband's ouster.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the African nation's struggle for independence in the 1950s and 1960s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost "tens of thousands of lives." This admission follows a 2022 historical commission report which detailed France's use of forced displacement and internment camps to suppress the independence movement. The move is part of a broader effort by Macron to confront France's colonial past.</p>

Police noted that thieves are becoming more sophisticated, using surveillance and Wi-Fi jammers, and often target celebrities whose travel schedules are public.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to President Trump to protect their security interests during his upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin. They expressed apprehension that a deal could be struck without their involvement, potentially making concessions that would endanger the continent and undermine international law. The leaders emphasized that a just peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's participation and must respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This plea reflects Europe's deep-seated fear that if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, his aggression could then be directed toward an EU member state.</p>

          <p>Health officials are warning of a growing risk from Vibrio vulnificus, a "flesh-eating" bacteria that thrives in warm coastal waters, as rising ocean temperatures allow it to spread further north.

The bacteria typically enters the body through open wounds or consumption of raw seafood like oysters. With climate change leading to warmer waters and more severe storms, the public health threat posed by this bacteria is expected to increase.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who is serving consecutive life sentences for the murder of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly being subjected to relentless harassment in prison.

The report suggests that prison officials are unlikely to intervene as the harassment does not pose a direct physical threat.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market rallied sharply on Tuesday, with major indexes approaching record highs, following the release of favorable inflation data. The report showed that consumer prices in July rose 2.7% from a year earlier, slightly below economists' expectations and fueling investor optimism. This has increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will proceed with an interest rate cut at its next meeting in September. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, providing a potential boost to the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are facing significantly reduced harvests, with some seeing 30% fewer peaches this year. The decline is attributed to warmer winter temperatures, which have disrupted the essential "sleep cycle" that stone fruit trees require to produce a healthy crop. This phenomenon, a direct consequence of climate change, is impacting farmers' livelihoods and leading to higher prices for consumers. While some farmers with older groves have fared better, the trend poses a serious threat to California's stone fruit industry.</p>
