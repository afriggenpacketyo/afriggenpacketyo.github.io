          <p>US agriculture exporters are facing a 'full-blown crisis' due to global backlash from tariffs, particularly a decline in Chinese buying. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition reports significant financial losses among members due to canceled export orders and supply chain disruptions. Examples include canceled wood pulp and paperboard shipments, and grass seed orders. The Port of Oakland warns of potential job losses and economic instability due to tariff-induced downturns in cargo volume, affecting exports like almonds, beef, pork, and recycled materials. China represents a substantial portion of Oakland's trade volume, making the situation particularly precarious. (not investment advice)</p>

The Laken Riley Act was introduced following the murder of a 22-year-old nursing student by an illegal immigrant in Georgia.

          <p>The Trump administration has dropped the CFPB's lawsuit against National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts, foregoing a $2.25 million settlement intended for harmed borrowers. The CFPB had accused the trusts of improper debt collection lawsuits against private student loan borrowers. This decision follows other moves by the Trump administration to weaken the CFPB, including attempts to cut staff and dismissing a lawsuit against the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. These actions signal a shift in the government's approach to consumer financial protection and student loan servicing.</p>

          <p>Apollo Global Management forecasts a U.S. recession this summer due to the economic impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

While the administration acknowledges potential economic disruption, it anticipates a 'detox period' rather than a recession. Some analysts point to evidence of 'pull-forward' in orders, which may delay the predicted shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice argued that the deportation of four alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador did not violate a court order, as the deportation was carried out by the Department of Defense, not DHS. A court order required that individuals with a final removal order be given the chance to raise safety concerns before being deported to a third country. Attorneys for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance contested the DOJ's argument. The judge will decide whether to modify the injunction.</p>
