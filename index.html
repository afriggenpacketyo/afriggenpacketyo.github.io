          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million jury verdict against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019. The court rejected Trump's claim of presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide any new grounds for reconsideration. The three-judge panel also concluded that the district court made no errors in its rulings and found the jury's compensatory and punitive damages to be fair and reasonable given the evidence of Trump's reckless disregard for the truth. This decision follows a separate verdict where Trump was found liable for sexual assault and defamation.</p>

          <p>Street artist Banksy has unveiled a new mural in London depicting a judge in traditional attire beating an unarmed protester with a gavel. The artist claimed the work on Instagram, captioning it with its location at the Royal Courts of Justice. Activist groups have interpreted the piece as a commentary on the U.K. government's recent ban on the organization Palestine Action, viewing it as a powerful depiction of state-sanctioned brutality against civil liberties. The mural was quickly covered by security officials shortly after its appearance.</p>

          <p>A moose, believed to have traveled from Poland through the Czech Republic, has become a local celebrity in Lower Austria after weeks of sightings. Nicknamed Emil, the animal's journey has attracted significant public attention, leading to the creation of a large Facebook fan page. The moose's adventures included wandering onto main railway tracks, which caused a multi-hour shutdown of a major train line. Authorities and animal protection groups have urged the public to maintain their distance and not interfere with the animal for its own safety.</p>

          <p>Confidence among U.S. workers about their ability to find a new job has fallen to its lowest point since tracking began in 2013, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey. The probability of finding another job after a loss dropped sharply to 44.9%, signaling a reversal of the "Great Resignation" trend. This decline in confidence is linked to a slowing labor market where hiring has decreased, causing more workers to remain in their current positions amid economic uncertainty. The survey also showed increased expectations for a higher unemployment rate in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in a legal battle over its authority to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid approved by Congress. The administration is seeking an emergency halt to a lower court order that mandates the spending of over $4 billion, arguing the injunction presents a grave threat to the separation of powers. This conflict stems from President Trump's efforts to cancel funds for foreign assistance programs he deems unaligned with his policy objectives, a move congressional Democrats estimate has frozen over $425 billion in total federal funding.</p>

          <p>The article details the severe health crises facing the 14 million children worldwide who receive no vaccinations, with a focus on those in conflict zones like Sudan. War has devastated health infrastructure, leaving newborns and toddlers vulnerable to preventable but deadly diseases like pneumonia and rotavirus. Malnutrition exacerbates the danger, weakening immune systems and leading to a vicious cycle of illness. Experts explain that even if children survive these infections, they can suffer permanent disabilities such as hearing loss, blindness, and intellectual impairment.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is set to inaugurate the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, despite ongoing objections from downstream nations Egypt and Sudan. While Ethiopia celebrates the $5 billion dam as a crucial source of electricity and a symbol of national pride, Egypt and Sudan have warned it poses a grave threat to their water security. The Blue Nile, which the dam controls, supplies over 80% of the water for the Nile River. Years of negotiations have failed to produce an agreement on how the dam will be filled and operated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation and high interest rates persisting, financial experts are providing practical advice to help consumers curb credit card spending this fall. Key strategies include creating a detailed seasonal budget based on past expenses, using debit or cash for non-essential purchases to create emotional distance from spending, and removing saved card details from online shopping accounts to prevent impulse buys. Another effective tip is to set up transaction alerts that notify you when you have reached the midpoint of your budget, allowing for adjustments before overspending occurs.

Bayrou initiated the vote himself amid political gridlock over 44 billion euros in proposed budget cuts. If he is ousted, it will force President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years, potentially increasing political instability in the country. Despite the political uncertainty, major indices like Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 traded higher. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a communication expert, being highly likable is a learned skill centered on one simple rule: making others feel seen. This is achieved through small, consistent habits rather than grand gestures. These habits include remembering minor details about people, freely giving credit to others for their ideas, responding to everyone regardless of their status, and readily admitting when you are wrong. By practicing these behaviors, individuals can build stronger relationships and signal genuine warmth, attentiveness, and respect in their interactions.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team is facing a difficult decision ahead of its World Cup quarter-final against Scotland after star full-back Ellie Kildunne was ruled out with concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must choose between the less experienced but talented Emma Sing and the more seasoned utility back Helena Rowland. Rowland, who started at full-back in the 2022 World Cup, delivered a superb performance off the bench when Kildunne was injured, potentially giving her the edge for the crucial knockout match. Kildunne may be available for a potential semi-final if she recovers in time.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence has created some disruption, its overall impact on the U.S. labor market remains relatively small, according to an economist from the job site Indeed. Recent weakness in the job market is attributed more to general economic uncertainty, which has led businesses to slow hiring, rather than widespread job replacement by AI. Although some tech companies have announced AI-related layoffs, these have been largely confined to that sector. Experts note that there is a growing demand for workers with AI skills, suggesting augmentation is more likely than full replacement in many roles. (not investment advice)</p>
