          <p>GameStop has officially purchased 4,710 bitcoins, valued at over $500 million, marking its entry into cryptocurrency investments, following a strategy similar to MicroStrategy. The video game retailer's shares experienced a dip of more than 8% following the announcement, despite the company having a substantial cash reserve of $4.76 billion as of February 1. This move is part of CEO Ryan Cohen's efforts to revitalize the business by cutting costs and streamlining operations to achieve profitability. GameStop's initial intention to add cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet was reported earlier this year, and the company has not set a limit on the amount of bitcoin it may purchase.

          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is a more significant predictor of financial well-being than income or assets. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors revealed that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, surpassing the impact of a $500,000 income or $1 million in assets. This finding highlights the importance of preparedness for unexpected expenses, as the median cost of an emergency is approximately $2,000. The study also found that individuals with emergency savings spend less time worrying about their finances each week. (not investment advice)</p>

The festival's artistic director, Evelyn Meining, emphasizes that true friendship requires trust and mutual understanding, something that even millions of social media followers cannot replace. The festival also highlights artistic friendships among performers, such as Nils MÃ¶nkemeyer and William Youn, who commissioned a new piece inspired by Mozart's transparency. The festival aims to dispel misconceptions about Mozart's relationships with contemporaries like Antonio Salieri, portraying them as mutually respectful colleagues rather than rivals.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the Republican spending bill, arguing that it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in reducing wasteful government spending. Musk stated that the bill, projected to increase the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, contradicts DOGE's efforts, which have reportedly saved $170 billion in taxpayer money since January. While Trump and congressional Republicans argue the bill reduces spending in key areas and will generate growth, Musk has pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies, noting the federal bureaucracy is "much worse than I realized."</p>

          <p>A French court has sentenced surgeon Joel Le Scouarnec to the maximum 20-year prison term for sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly children, over two decades. Le Scouarnec, already imprisoned for previous offenses, admitted to sexually assaulting or raping 299 patients, many while they were under anesthesia, between 1989 and 2014. The case has raised questions about why more was not done sooner to stop him, especially after a 2005 conviction for possessing child sexual abuse material. Victims and advocates highlight systemic failures that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes, and have called for a national policy to prevent pedophilia.</p>

The tax is estimated to generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects like replenishing sand on Waikiki beaches and clearing flammable invasive grasses. The measure adds 0.75% to the daily room rate tax and levies a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills, bringing the total levy on accommodations to nearly 19%. Governor Green argues that the increase is small enough that tourists will not feel much of a difference, and that many visitors will welcome committing dollars to protect shorelines and communities.</p>

          <p>The AI industrial trade is regaining momentum, with GE Vernova shares reaching an all-time high after a period of market volatility. GE Vernova's success is attributed to being earlier in a potential upcycle for revenue and orders compared to peers like Eaton and Vertiv, and to a larger backlog. Recent deals, such as the $14.2 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia and support for the U.S. nuclear power industry, have also boosted the stock. Despite this positive momentum, the Club has downgraded the stock to a hold-equivalent rating due to its parabolic move higher. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that consumers struggling with credit card debt may want to consider credit card debt forgiveness this June. High interest rates on credit cards are unlikely to drop significantly anytime soon, making forgiveness a potentially beneficial option. The process can take a while, so starting sooner is important to avoid compounding interest and sinking deeper into debt. Credit card debt forgiveness hurts your credit less than other options, and it shows future creditors you made an effort to repay. (not investment advice)</p>
