          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a federal charge against Decarlos Brown Jr. for the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a light rail car in Charlotte, North Carolina. The charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or death. The attack has drawn national attention, with officials citing it as an example of failed crime policies, while details reveal the suspect has a long criminal history and known mental health issues.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican-led state House has passed a new congressional map designed to increase the GOP's advantage from a 6-2 to a 7-1 delegation majority. The plan, part of a national push by former President Trump, specifically targets the district of Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver by making it more conservative. The measure now moves to the state Senate and is expected to face legal challenges, following similar partisan redistricting efforts in states like Texas and California.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential interest earnings from depositing $40,000 into a high-yield savings account, noting that current top rates around 4.35% can generate over $1,700 in one year. It highlights that while these accounts offer better returns than traditional savings, the variable rates are expected to decline with anticipated Federal Reserve cuts. The text suggests savers should also consider alternatives like CDs for fixed rates, weighing the benefits of liquidity against the unpredictability of a changing interest rate environment.

          <p>Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine is pushing back against a $700,000 ad campaign from a PAC linked to Senator Chuck Schumer, which criticizes her for opposing a congressional stock trading ban. The ads suggest she has personally profited, but Collins' office states she has never owned or traded individual stocks during her Senate tenure. Her husband's investments are managed by a third party, and no trades have been made in nearly three years, framing the ads as a misleading political attack ahead of a potential re-election campaign.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu, 39, as the new prime minister following the ousting of François Bayrou's government in a confidence vote.

His appointment marks the fifth prime minister of Macron's second term and has already drawn criticism from both left and right political factions, signaling a challenging road ahead for the new government.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates declining and a Federal Reserve rate cut anticipated, this article explores the potential benefits of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) for homebuyers. ARMs currently offer lower initial interest rates compared to fixed-rate loans, providing immediate cost savings and a buffer against short-term market volatility. The structure allows borrowers to secure a lower payment for an initial period of several years, giving them time to gauge the market and potentially refinance later if rates stabilize at a lower point.

          <h2>Analysis Shows U.S. Manufacturing Sector Shedding Thousands of Jobs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 13:49:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new analysis of government labor data, the U.S. manufacturing sector is experiencing a significant decline, having lost 42,000 jobs since April. The report attributes the job losses to economic uncertainty fueled by the Trump administration's tariff policies, which have increased costs and discouraged hiring by companies like John Deere. This trend counters the administration's stated goal of revitalizing American manufacturing, with economists noting that businesses are streamlining operations in response to rising costs and unpredictable trade policies.
