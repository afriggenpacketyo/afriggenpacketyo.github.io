          <h2>Defense Secretary Hegseth's Use of Unsecured Line Raises Security Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 18:37:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reportedly used the Signal app on a personal computer connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, known as a "dirty line," within his Pentagon office. This line lacks the firewall protections of the Defense Department's systems, potentially exposing sensitive communications to monitoring. While a DOD spokesperson stated Hegseth has never used Signal on his government computer, the use of an unsecured line raises concerns about potential security vulnerabilities and the handling of classified information within the Defense Department. The incident has prompted scrutiny of communication protocols within the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation replaced its legal team defending New York City's congestion pricing program after accusing them of undermining the department's efforts to halt the toll. This move followed the accidental filing of a confidential memo by the U.S. attorney's office questioning the department's legal strategy and advocating for a different approach. The transportation secretary was accused of using shaky rationale to end the tolling plan and was “exceedingly likely” to fail. The memo has since been removed from the public docket and the case has been transferred to the Justice Department in Washington.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut bureaucratic fat as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have resulted in significant costs to taxpayers. While Musk initially promised trillions in savings, he now estimates only $150 billion, a fraction of the original pledge. Firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave of thousands of workers are estimated to cost upwards of $135 billion this fiscal year. The Internal Revenue Service alone could lose $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 due to a DOGE-driven exodus of employees.</p>

          <p>Ryan Hemphill, a lawyer, has been charged with sexually assaulting six women he met online over a five-month period.

He is also accused of threatening the women to prevent them from reporting the sexual assault. Hemphill was arraigned on a 116-count indictment in Manhattan Criminal Court and prosecutors believe there may be additional victims.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly giving migrants as little as 12 hours to contest their deportation after being formally notified under the Alien Enemies Act. According to an unsealed ICE document, migrants have a limited time frame to express intent to file a habeas petition and a slightly longer period to actually file it. The ACLU has criticized this short timeframe, arguing it is insufficient. The Supreme Court recently halted deportations of Venezuelan criminals under the Act, highlighting ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a presidential memorandum directing the attorney general to investigate the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue. The memo aims to crack down on supposed foreign contributions to elections, an unsubstantiated claim from the right. ActBlue's CEO anticipates the action and asserts that it will not deter their mission. The move is among several actions the Trump administration has taken to "cripple the left" ahead of the midterms, according to reports.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating a "minerals-for-security" agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo, granting U.S. firms access to Congolese mineral assets in exchange for military support. This move reflects a shift in U.S. policy towards Africa's mining sector, driven by competition with China and a recalibrated doctrine under the Trump administration. This contrasts with the Biden administration's approach, which emphasized partnership, climate cooperation, and development, such as the Lobito Corridor project.</p>

He warned that these actors could disrupt the country’s power networks in the event of a geopolitical crisis.

          <p>The Trump administration's National Security Council (NSC) is facing chaos and instability, marked by firings, disregard for protocol, and the influence of online influencers. The NSC was purged of expertise early in Trump's second term, with many officials not receiving proper briefings. The dismissals and failure to follow protocol have led to dysfunction and marginalized the NSC in foreign policy decision-making. The situation stems from Trump's impatience with process, disregard for the law, and insistence on loyalty over expertise.</p>

          <p>President Trump's order to ban transgender people from serving in the US military is likely to be upheld by the Supreme Court. Despite arguments that the ban is discriminatory, the Court has historically shown deference to the military. Precedents such as Goldman v. Weinberger and Rostker v. Goldberg demonstrate the Court's willingness to allow the military to engage in activities that would be unconstitutional in a civilian context. The Court's current conservative majority is also unlikely to be sympathetic to constitutional claims brought by trans litigants.</p>
