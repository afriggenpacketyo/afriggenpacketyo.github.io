          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 17:55:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates a significant rise in homeowners delisting their properties, with a 48% increase from the previous year. This trend reflects seller frustration with a cooling market, as many are unwilling to lower their asking prices, which were set based on pandemic-era highs. Experts suggest this is creating a deadlock, preventing prices from adjusting to current buyer demand and potentially prolonging the market's holding pattern. The phenomenon is particularly pronounced in markets like Miami, where sellers are most reluctant to reduce prices.</p>

          <p>Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the long-reigning leader of the Sinaloa cartel, has pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to charges including leading a criminal enterprise and drug trafficking. In his statement, the 75-year-old admitted to smuggling vast quantities of drugs and orchestrating violence, while also highlighting decades of bribing Mexican officials. Despite his lawyer's denial of a cooperation deal, Zambada's guilty plea and family history have fueled speculation that he may reveal secrets about high-level corruption within the Mexican government, a prospect that could have significant political ramifications.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has confirmed the return of its popular seasonal beverage, the Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL), starting Tuesday, August 26th. This marks another year of the fall menu's launch creeping earlier into the summer calendar. Alongside the iconic PSL, which has been a major success for over two decades, the menu will feature new items like Pecan Cold Foam, aiming to boost sales after a recent reported decline. The company is banking on the popularity of its seasonal offerings to attract customers and reverse weakening in-store traffic trends.</p>

Surrounded by Gold Star families, Trump stated the attack "should have never been allowed to have happened." The event was framed by administration officials as a corrective to the previous administration's handling of the withdrawal, which they heavily criticized as incompetent. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also claimed the withdrawal's execution emboldened Russia to invade Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to China, stating that the U.S. must be guaranteed a supply of rare earth magnets or face tariffs as high as 200%. Speaking at the White House, Trump emphasized that while he possesses "incredible cards" against China, he prefers not to use them as it would be destructive. This statement highlights the ongoing strategic tensions over critical resources, with the president using the threat of severe economic penalties to secure supply chains for essential industrial and technological components.

          <p>A U.S. district judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Kilmar Ábrego García, who was recently detained by ICE after being brought back to the U.S. following a wrongful deportation.

The judge expressed concern over these pressure tactics and forbade his removal until an evidentiary hearing.

          <p>Ukraine has intensified its drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, targeting key facilities like oil refineries and gas terminals to undermine Moscow's war-making capabilities. Recent strikes hit a gas terminal in the Leningrad region and an oil refinery in Samara, with Ukrainian officials stating the goal is to reduce Russia's foreign currency inflows and disrupt fuel supplies to its military. These actions are a direct response to Russia's systematic targeting of Ukraine's own energy grid. The strategy appears to be impacting Russia's economy, contributing to a reported fuel crisis and a drop in oil refining capacity.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper has announced its intention to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's for approximately $18 billion. The deal is expected to strengthen Keurig's coffee business, which has experienced slowing sales of its single-serve pods and brewers. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to separate its beverage and newly expanded coffee units into two distinct, publicly traded U.S. companies. This move would effectively reverse the 2018 merger of Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple, signaling a major strategic shift for the beverage giant. (not investment advice)</p>

Giuffre, who stated before her death that she wanted the memoir published, was instrumental in exposing the sex trafficking ring that led to the imprisonment of both Epstein and Maxwell.

          <p>Netflix saw box office success with a limited, two-day theatrical release of a sing-along version of its animated hit "KPop Demon Hunters," with estimates ranging from $16 to $20 million in domestic sales. Despite the strong performance, industry analysts believe this does not signal a major shift in Netflix's streaming-first strategy. The company uses such theatrical releases primarily as promotional "events" to generate buzz and drive streaming viewership, rather than as a core revenue stream. This approach allows Netflix to create cultural moments for its biggest hits while avoiding the high marketing costs of traditional studio releases.</p>
