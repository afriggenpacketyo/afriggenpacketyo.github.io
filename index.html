          <p>An article in the People's Liberation Army Daily discusses the potential advantages of humanoid robots in future warfare, noting their tactical flexibility and strategic deterrence. The commentary references China's Tien Kung Ultra robot, which excelled in a half-marathon, as evidence of the bipedal design's ability to navigate complex environments. The article also mentions a Russian robot capable of shooting guns, highlighting the global interest in robotic military applications. This suggests that China is actively exploring the integration of advanced robotics into its military strategy, viewing it as a key component of modern warfare.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that despite concerns about Trump's approach to the Ukraine war, he is correct in recognizing the tragedy of continued conflict and the potential for economic benefits from ending it. The board suggests that instead of withdrawing from cease-fire talks, Trump should increase pressure on both Russia and Ukraine to reach an agreement. The editorial outlines a potential deal where Russia retains control of occupied territories, sanctions are lifted, and Ukraine receives security guarantees and closer integration with the European economy. This outlines a complex situation that requires strategic diplomacy to end a war that has become unsustainable for both sides.</p>

          <p>Ibram X. Kendi argues that the Trump administration is systematically attacking Black history by purging content, removing books, eliminating observances, and defunding institutions. Kendi draws a parallel to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false narratives fueled violence against Black Atlantans, and highlights the story of J. Max Barber, who challenged those lies. Kendi contends that the administration's framing of Black history as "D.E.I." is a tactic to justify attacks on Black history as protecting white Americans. He concludes that this assault on Black history endangers the opportunity for all Americans to understand the enduring impact of racial inequity and injustice.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump pardoned Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," who were serving prison sentences for bank fraud and tax evasion. The couple had been convicted of conspiring to defraud community banks out of millions of dollars and evading taxes, with their sentences later reduced after their initial sentencing. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, expressed gratitude and shock at the pardon, stating that it "literally came out of nowhere."

          <p>The NBA's potential expansion into Europe is raising questions about the future of European basketball, particularly regarding the EuroLeague and the cultural differences between the American and European models. The NBA and FIBA are exploring a new professional league in Europe, potentially launching by the 2026-27 season, with significant financial backing. While some see benefits in increased finances and TV coverage, others fear it could harm European basketball's traditions and atmosphere, which is deeply rooted in local identity and passionate fan support. The success of NBA Europe hinges on balancing commercialization with preserving the unique aspects of European basketball culture.</p>

          <p>Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, inspires U.S. conservatives, despite critics labeling his rule as a "dictatorship." Orbán has been accused of remaking the courts, financially starving independent press, changing the constitution to consolidate power, and stifling civil society. The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) now converges on Budapest for a fourth consecutive year, symbolizing the cross-cultural cooperation and admiration. Despite criticisms, Orbán's government has invested heavily in think tanks and educational institutions to promote its international presence, appealing to conservatives who admire his confrontational approach to issues like immigration and minority rights.</p>

          <p>Experts are worried about the safety of the U.S. food supply following significant cutbacks to federal agencies responsible for monitoring it. The Trump administration's cuts to the FDA, USDA, and CDC have led to staff retirements and reduced inspections, potentially increasing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Policy changes, such as rolling back salmonella regulations for poultry, also raise concerns. While the FDA and USDA claim these changes won't affect food safety, experts argue that the loss of expertise and resources could lead to another outbreak like the Boar's Head deli meat contamination.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man remains missing after a significant landslide caused by a glacier collapse destroyed 90% of an Alpine village in Switzerland. The incident occurred near Blatten, in the Lötschental valley, with a large chunk of the Birch Glacier breaking off and causing the landslide. Authorities had previously evacuated around 300 people and livestock due to concerns about the glacier's stability. The regional government said that the mudslide also buried the nearby Lonza River bed, raising the possibility of dammed water flows, with Swiss glaciologists expressing concerns about the accelerated retreat of glaciers due to global warming.</p>

Although the White House appealed the ruling, investors took heart after months of turmoil caused by Trump's trade war. The ruling also pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen, while stock markets in Asia and Europe saw gains. (not investment advice)</p>

Danny Care, who was on the bench that day, is also bowing out, all of whom have given a huge amount to the English game.

China's "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform the country into a leading high-end manufacturer, but experts warn that this strategy could run counter to U.S. demands in ongoing trade talks. Despite missing some key targets, China's commitment to manufacturing-led growth remains strong.</p>

          <p>Two hikers in New York's Adirondack Mountains called 911 to report that a third member of their party had died, but it turned out they were mistaken after ingesting hallucinogenic mushrooms. The hikers, who were also lost, were found to be in an altered mental state by a state forest ranger and a mountain steward. The supposedly deceased person was found unharmed, and the two hikers who made the call were escorted to a hospital. This bizarre incident highlights the dangers of consuming unknown substances in the wilderness.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the past five years, according to the Housing Ombudsman. The watchdog warns that an "imbalance of power" between tenants and landlords is leading to "simmering anger" and risks the "managed decline" of social housing. Common complaints include asbestos, electrical and fire safety issues, pest control, and leaks, damp, and mold. The Housing Ombudsman is calling for a "transformative overhaul" of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a "national tenant body."</p>

A new Digital Targeting Web will connect soldiers with key information from satellites, aircraft, and drones, speeding up the targeting of enemy threats.

The Trump administration said it would appeal within minutes of the ruling, leaving uncertainty regarding what comes next. The ruling was based on two separate cases brought by businesses and US state governments, and the White House has criticized the ruling.</p>
