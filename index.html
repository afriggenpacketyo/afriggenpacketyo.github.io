          <p>The U.S. government has taken a 10% stake in Canadian mineral exploration company Trilogy Metals, causing its shares to surge over 200%. This partnership, involving a $35.6 million investment, is part of a White House initiative to secure domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper from Alaska's Ambler mining district. The company praised the decision, which reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, as a move to strengthen domestic supply chains for resources essential to energy and defense. However, the project remains controversial due to environmental concerns from opponents who argue it will harm local ecosystems.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is confronting a deepening political crisis, with growing calls for his resignation or for snap elections to be held. The turmoil intensified after the country's fifth prime minister in less than two years resigned, and former allies, including two ex-prime ministers, publicly criticized Macron's leadership and decision-making. The president is struggling to form a stable majority government in the National Assembly, leading rivals to suggest options like appointing a prime minister from an opposing party, a practice known as "cohabitation."</p>

          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on a Sacramento freeway, leaving the three crew members—a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic—with critical injuries. The aircraft was returning to its dispatch point after transporting a patient when it experienced an in-air emergency. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy highway were involved in the incident, which officials described as "mind blowing." The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the cause of the crash, which involved an Airbus EC-130 T2 helicopter.</p>

          <h2>Rise of Alternative Capital Allows Tech Startups to Delay Public Offerings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:14:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Startups are increasingly delaying their initial public offerings (IPOs), with the median age of a company going public now at 13 years, up from 10 years in 2018. This trend is largely fueled by the massive growth of alternative capital from sources like private equity, venture capital, and sovereign wealth funds, which now provide sufficient funding for companies to mature in private hands. As a result, companies are achieving much larger revenues and valuations before they enter public markets. This shift reduces the pressure to raise capital through an IPO, though some analysts question if future returns in private markets will remain as high.</p>

          <h2>Air Traffic Controller Shortages Linked to Government Shutdown Cause Flight Delays at US Airports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 10:12:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A government shutdown is contributing to significant flight delays at major U.S. airports, including Denver and Burbank, due to a shortage of air traffic controllers. As essential federal employees, controllers are required to work without pay during the shutdown, which has reportedly led to a slight increase in sick calls. This staffing strain forces the FAA to reduce the number of takeoffs and landings to maintain safety, creating a ripple effect of delays and cancellations. The situation underscores the fragility of the U.S. aviation system, which is already grappling with a nationwide shortage of certified controllers.</p>

          <p>Israelis marked the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas-led terrorist attack with somber memorials for the approximately 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage. Deep divisions within the country were evident, as the main memorial event was organized by bereaved families rather than the government, reflecting widespread frustration with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership. The anniversary takes place as the devastating war in Gaza continues, and indirect negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages are underway in Egypt.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has appointed Frank Bisignano, the current Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA), to also serve as the CEO of the IRS. This unprecedented dual leadership role has sparked concern among policy experts and advocates, who worry that one individual cannot effectively manage both massive agencies. Critics argue the move could spread leadership too thin, potentially harming services for the 74 million Americans who rely on Social Security. There are also concerns about ensuring the sensitive taxpayer and medical data held by the respective agencies remains separate.</p>

The project is presented as a cooperative alternative to the proliferation of private satellite networks, such as SpaceX's Starlink, which are projected to launch tens of thousands of satellites.

          <p>While a government shutdown forces hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, members of Congress and the president will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is authorized under the Constitution and funded by a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal from Congress. In contrast, the pay for most federal workers, including congressional staff, is subject to the annual appropriations process and is therefore halted until a funding agreement is reached. This disparity highlights a key difference in how a shutdown affects elected leaders versus the civil service.</p>

A better approach may be to weigh your current marginal tax rate against your expected effective tax rate in retirement. Since the U.S. has a progressive tax system, your effective rate—the total tax paid as a percentage of total income—is often significantly lower than your top marginal rate, potentially making pretax contributions more advantageous than commonly assumed.

          <p>Tomaino Ndam Njoya has emerged as a significant challenger in Cameroon's upcoming presidential election, running as the only woman against 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya, who is seeking an eighth term after four decades in power. As the mayor of Foumban and leader of the UDC party, Ndam Njoya is campaigning to lead the nation into a "new era" and has been endorsed by a dozen former presidential candidates. Her candidacy is seen as a sign of political change in a country grappling with internal conflict and youth unemployment, reflecting a broader trend of rising female leadership in African politics.</p>

          <p>British Conservative politician Robert Jenrick has defended remarks from a leaked recording in which he described a part of Birmingham as the "closest I've come to a slum" and lamented a lack of integration. He stated he would not shy away from discussing what he called "ghettoised communities" and people living "parallel lives," arguing it is a dangerous issue that must be addressed. Critics, including Labour's West Midlands Mayor, have condemned the comments as racist and divisive, accusing Jenrick of intentionally using people's skin color to make a political point.</p>

This revelation comes as Belanger faces a new lawsuit from a woman who alleges he used excessive force during her arrest in the same month the letter was written, suggesting a pattern of behavior that supervisors may have been aware of.</p>

This ultimatum follows the passage of a 2019 Canadian law that made it illegal to keep whales and dolphins in captivity, leaving the park in a difficult financial and ethical position regarding the animals' future.</p>

          <p>A growing number of commercial buildings are installing thermal energy storage systems, also known as "ice batteries," to provide sustainable and cost-effective air conditioning. The technology involves freezing large quantities of water overnight, when electricity is cheaper and demand on the power grid is lower. During the day, the melting ice is used to chill water that circulates through the building's cooling system, significantly reducing electricity consumption during peak hours. This innovative approach helps lower energy bills, reduce carbon emissions, and ease the strain on aging power grids.</p>

This optimism is driven by strong macroeconomic conditions and a surge in demand for AI-related goods like semiconductors and servers, particularly in Asia. However, the outlook for 2026 is far more pessimistic, with the WTO slashing its growth prediction to just 0.5%. This anticipated slowdown is attributed to a cooling global economy and the full-year impact of widespread trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
