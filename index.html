          <p>Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson is demanding the National Archives provide all records related to former President Joe Biden's physical and mental health. As part of a Senate investigation into an alleged "cover-up" of cognitive decline, Johnson's request targets communications from senior White House officials, including former chiefs of staff and advisors. The probe seeks to determine who was making key decisions if the former president was allegedly incapable, tying into a separate investigation of his use of an autopen for official documents.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a former personal attorney for President Trump, for a lifetime federal judgeship on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote proceeded along party lines after all Democratic members walked out in protest, citing concerns over Bove's intense loyalty to the president and recent whistleblower allegations. Critics, including hundreds of former DOJ lawyers, fear his confirmation would undermine the judiciary's independence, though the nomination is now set for a full Senate vote.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto attributes his successful All-Star season to the high-pressure experience he gained during last year's playoffs. After struggling during his rookie season, Yamamoto delivered a crucial, scoreless performance in a winner-take-all postseason game, which he says was a major source of confidence. This transformation from a nervous newcomer into the team's most dependable starting pitcher reflects his significant growth, both technically and mentally, making him a key asset for the team.</p>

          <p>Peacock is raising its subscription fees, with the standard Peacock Premium plan increasing by $3 to $10.99 per month and the ad-free Premium Plus option rising to $16.99. This price hike follows a trend set by other major streaming services like Netflix as media companies grapple with the high costs of programming and transitioning to streaming-focused business models. To soften the blow, NBCUniversal announced it will also test a new, lower-priced "Select" tier for $7.99 a month.</p>

          <p>A California State University professor, John Caravello, was arrested and charged with assaulting a federal officer during a protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a cannabis farm. The raid, which resulted in the death of a worker, has drawn widespread scrutiny. Colleagues and witnesses are defending Caravello, stating he was peacefully demonstrating and attempting to help another protester in a wheelchair when he was arrested, and they dispute the official account that he threw a teargas canister at agents.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Labour government has announced plans to introduce legislation that would lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for all national elections. This significant democratic reform, a key campaign promise, would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers and aims to boost political participation. The proposal has sparked debate, with supporters arguing that 16-year-olds who can work and pay taxes deserve a say, while critics question their maturity and readiness to vote.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that nearly one in four Americans over the age of 50 are delaying their retirement, a significant increase from last year. The primary drivers for this trend are economic concerns, including financial uncertainty, high inflation, and fears of a stock market downturn.
