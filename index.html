          <p>Patrick McGee's 'Apple in China' argues that Apple's reliance on Chinese manufacturing has created a significant vulnerability for the world, not just the company itself. By training millions of workers in China, Apple has inadvertently fostered the growth of Chinese technology, potentially outpacing American innovation. The article highlights how Apple's massive investment in China has enabled the country's technological self-sufficiency, posing risks to global competitiveness. Despite some minor inaccuracies and a lack of Chinese perspectives, the article persuasively exposes the uncomfortable relationship between Apple and China, suggesting that Apple has played a crucial role in China's rise as a global power.</p>

Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, wealthy consumers continue to fuel demand for luxury jewelry, leading to double-digit growth for brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced a decline, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, overall sales rose, highlighting the resilience of the luxury market's high end.

          <p>The PL-15E, a Chinese-made air-to-air missile, was recently deployed by the Pakistan Air Force during a skirmish with India in Kashmir, marking its first combat test. This event highlights the growing capabilities of China's air-to-air missile systems and their potential impact on regional security in the Asia-Pacific, especially concerning Taiwan. While assessing the missile's performance has been challenging due to conflicting claims, its deployment sparks discussions about expanding air-to-air missile exports as China aims to challenge the Western-dominated global arms market.</p>

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department following allegations of sexual assault. The accusations stem from a civil suit filed by four former housekeepers who claim Robinson committed sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and created a hostile work environment. Robinson's attorney denies the allegations, suggesting the police report was filed to publicize the civil case. The accusers, identified as Hispanic women, allege the sexual assaults occurred during their employment, with one woman claiming Robinson sexually assaulted her multiple times after showering. The women state that they did not come forward earlier due to their immigration status.</p>

          <p>An international research team has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study reveals that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, specifically from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This research, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, offers insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines. Archaeological evidence suggests this migration occurred at least 23,000 years ago, with human presence confirmed at the southern tip of South America by 14,500 years ago.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with official data revealing a 0.2% drop compared to the previous quarter, marking the first decline since early 2024. This contraction is largely attributed to falling exports, which have been impacted by uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies and tariffs imposed by President Trump. The aging population and rising welfare costs further exacerbate the economic vulnerabilities, leading to concerns about a potential recession. While the central bank had begun to gradually hike interest rates, the economic slowdown may prompt calls for increased fiscal spending to stimulate growth.</p>

The Hinduja family tops the list for the fourth consecutive year, despite a decline in their fortune. The decrease in billionaires is attributed to various tax changes, including the abolition of non-dom status, which has angered affluent individuals and prompted concerns about the UK's attractiveness to the world's super-rich.</p>

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a potential political disaster as far-right candidate George Simion gains momentum in the upcoming presidential runoff.

The author argues that mainstream parties have failed to address the broken economic model that has led to this situation, leaving the country vulnerable to populist movements. While Simion's economic agenda primarily caters to the domestic business class, it offers little to address the needs of poor Romanians, suggesting a continuation of existing economic inequalities.</p>

Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors diversifying away from the U.S. due to concerns about trade uncertainties.

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law allowing preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the authority to monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law will require operators of key infrastructure, such as electricity and railway sectors, to report cyber breaches to the government. The move reflects Japan's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations. A new independent panel will be established to oversee data acquisition and analysis, ensuring government surveillance is properly conducted.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted for the first time in a year, shrinking by 0.2% in the March quarter due to a sharp decline in exports. The gross domestic product data was poorer than expected, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies affected Japan's export-heavy economy, while domestic demand showed strength, growing 0.6%. Despite a weak yen providing a competitive advantage, China's machinery and tool exports outperformed Japan's. The Bank of Japan is likely to maintain its current policy, expecting a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. in the coming months.</p>

However, economists warn that Europe faces a bleak outlook if it fails to adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder trade.
