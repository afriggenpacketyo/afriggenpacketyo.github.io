          <h2>Trump Explains Severing Ties with Jeffrey Epstein Over Poaching Employees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 11:39:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump stated he ended his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein years ago because Epstein repeatedly hired staff away from his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking in Scotland, Trump described the matter as "old history," asserting he threw Epstein out after he poached employees on more than one occasion, making him "persona non grata." This explanation comes amid renewed questions about their past friendship, following the 2019 death of Epstein, who faced child sex trafficking charges. The comments provide Trump's perspective on the fallout, which has previously been attributed to other disputes.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to halt deadly border clashes that have killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim during an ASEAN regional bloc meeting. The conflict, which flared after a landmine incident, represents a rare military confrontation between ASEAN members. Both nations' leaders expressed commitment to de-escalation, a move praised by U.S. President Trump, who had threatened to halt trade deals if hostilities continued.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Sphere is set to screen the 1939 classic "The Wizard of Oz" as its first-ever immersive film experience. The project will utilize the venue's massive wraparound screen, 16K resolution, spatial audio, and haptic seating to place audiences inside the movie's world. Engineers used AI "outpainting" to expand the original film frames to fit the unique space, while 4D effects like wind and fog will enhance the experience. The innovative presentation, opening to the public on August 28, aims to immerse viewers without altering the original film's content.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russia to reach a peace agreement with Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just "10 or 12 days." Citing a lack of progress, Trump expressed his disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin and threatened to impose massive "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners if a deal is not reached. This move escalates pressure on Russia to end the conflict, marking a shift in Trump's public stance, which has become increasingly critical of Putin's actions in Ukraine as the war has intensified.</p>

          <p>A Swiss study has found that the human immune system can be activated merely by seeing virtual images of sick people. Researchers used VR headsets to show participants avatars, some of which appeared to have rashes or coughs. Brain monitoring and subsequent blood tests revealed that viewing the sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered a response in the participants' innate immune cells. The findings suggest the brain can prime the body's defenses against a perceived threat before any actual pathogen is present, opening potential new avenues for non-pharmacological therapies.</p>

Similar to lane departure warnings in cars, the vibrations would guide a pilot on how to respond if they show signs of being disoriented, especially when flying in clouds or bad weather.

          <p>Preparations are underway to refit a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, donated by Qatar, for use as Air Force One. A memorandum of understanding outlines the "unconditional donation" of the aircraft to the U.S. Defense Department. The move has drawn scrutiny over constitutional rules preventing a president from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. While the jet itself is a gift, the Pentagon will be responsible for the substantial costs of security upgrades and renovations needed to make it flight-ready for presidential use.</p>

This summer's transfer market is dominated by interest in strikers like Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres, highlighting a tactical shift back toward a dedicated goalscorer. Even Pep Guardiola, a proponent of fluid forward lines, adapted his system for Erling Haaland.

          <p>As homeowners look to tap into their record-high home equity, experts are advising on the choice between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan. With interest rates remaining elevated, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers predictability, making it suitable for large, one-time expenses. Conversely, a variable-rate HELOC provides flexibility for ongoing or uncertain costs, with the potential for lower payments if the Fed cuts rates. The best choice ultimately depends on the borrower's specific financial needs, project timeline, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

While some view it as a one-off financial decision, others see it as a sign of decline for the genre amid shifting viewer habits and rising production costs. The article notes that while shows like Colbert's lose money on linear TV advertising, they can be profitable when digital revenue is included. The future of other shows will be a key indicator of the industry's long-term commitment to late-night programming.</p>
