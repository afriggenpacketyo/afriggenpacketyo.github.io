          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure company Nebius Group surged by 40% in premarket trading after announcing a multi-year, $19.4 billion deal with Microsoft. The Amsterdam-based firm, which spun out from Russian tech giant Yandex in 2023, will provide cloud computing power and graphics processing units (GPUs) for Microsoft's AI workloads through 2031. This agreement highlights the sustained high demand for the powerful computing equipment necessary for training and operating advanced AI systems.

Officials stated the reports "have no basis in truth" and that they are investigating a fire that occurred on the boat's deck. The activist group, the Global Sumud Flotilla, had released a statement and footage alleging an attack, asserting it was an act of aggression intended to intimidate their mission. Despite the incident, the group, which includes Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, affirmed its determination to continue its journey.</p>

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is overseeing the proceedings, which have been slowed by Routh's decision to represent himself and his attempts to ask potential jurors what the judge deemed "politically charged" questions. Prosecutors allege Routh planned the attack for months, hiding in bushes with a rifle before being spotted by a Secret Service agent and fleeing the scene before his arrest.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it conducted a "precise strike" in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders whom it holds responsible for the October 7th attack and the ongoing war. The strike reportedly hit a meeting where Hamas officials were discussing a U.S. ceasefire proposal. Qatar, a key U.S. ally and host to a major American military base, condemned the action as a "cowardly Israeli attack" and a violation of international law, vowing to investigate the incident.

          <p>The U.S. government could be forced to refund between $750 billion and $1 trillion if the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings that President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" are illegal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned of this staggering financial risk in a declaration urging the court to expedite its decision on the matter. The Trump administration is appealing rulings that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the levies. The case creates significant uncertainty for both the government and the businesses that have paid billions in tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the MAGA movement, despite its "nationalist" branding, functions as a global political entity, actively intervening in the domestic politics of other countries to support ideological allies. It cites examples such as the Trump administration's support for Poland's President Karol Nawrocki and Vice President J.D. Vance's engagement with far-right figures in the UK and Germany. The analysis posits that far-right parties worldwide are adopting Trump's rhetoric and tactics, creating a network that shares anti-immigrant, pro-Russian, and anti-vaccine messaging.

          <p>The traditional "September surge," a post-summer increase in job market activity, may not materialize with its usual strength this year, according to career experts. While some recruiters note that companies often ramp up hiring in the fall to meet year-end goals and use remaining budgets, others are more cautious. Citing recession fears and a weak summer job market, some experts predict only a modest pickup compared to previous years. To prepare, job seekers are advised to update their LinkedIn profiles to match their resumes and to be strategic in their applications rather than applying indiscriminately.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates remaining high, experts suggest several strategies for homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments this fall. One option is refinancing to a lower interest rate, which is most effective if the new rate is at least 0.75% below the current one, though closing costs must be considered. Another less common strategy is a mortgage recast, where a lump-sum payment is made to reduce the principal balance, thereby lowering subsequent monthly payments without changing the interest rate. For those facing financial hardship, a loan modification with their servicer could provide relief by altering the loan's original terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Outdated Treaties and Geopolitical Tensions Raise Concerns for Security in Outer Space</h2>

          <p>Experts warn that the legal frameworks governing outer space, like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, are dangerously outdated and ill-equipped to handle modern geopolitical realities. The rise of new state actors and powerful commercial entities like SpaceX has created a complex environment where the line between civilian and military use of space is blurred. With major powers like the U.S. establishing a Space Force and Russia declaring commercial satellites as potential targets, the risk of miscalculation and conflict is growing. Analysts suggest that new norms of behavior and economic penalties, rather than new treaties, may be the most viable path to ensuring stability.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, replacing Nuno Espirito Santo who was dismissed after 21 months in charge. Postecoglou returns to management just three months after being sacked by Tottenham Hotspur, despite leading the club to a historic Europa League victory last season. Forest's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, cited Postecoglou's consistent record of winning trophies as a key reason for the appointment, stating the club must now "compete with the very best and challenge for trophies." Postecoglou becomes the eighth permanent manager under Marinakis's ownership since 2017.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Against Renaming U.S. Defense Department to "Department of War"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 08:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that renaming the U.S. Department of Defense to the "Department of War" would be a costly and counterproductive move. The author argues that such a change would undermine America's moral standing and validate critics who accuse it of relying on force, rather than adapting to a multipolar world. While acknowledging the need for deep institutional reforms within the Pentagon to address its unwieldy and often inefficient bureaucracy, the piece concludes that a cosmetic name change is not the solution. Instead, it calls for a focus on genuine structural overhauls to improve the military's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Sam Curran is set to make his return to England's T20 cricket team for the first match of the series against South Africa in Cardiff. This marks his first appearance under head coach Brendon McCullum, following a strong performance in The Hundred competition for the Oval Invincibles. Curran's inclusion addresses the team's need for a seam bowling all-rounder, a role that was missed during the recent one-day international series. Opener Phil Salt also returns to the side after missing the previous series for paternity leave, as England looks to field a refreshed lineup.</p>

          <p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has acknowledged that athletes competing in the upcoming World Championships in Tokyo will face significant "heat challenges." The warning comes as Japan experiences its hottest summer on record, with temperatures 2.36°C above average. The opening day of the nine-day tournament, which includes the 35km race walk events, is forecasted to reach 32°C (nearly 90°F). These conditions are reminiscent of the challenges faced during the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, raising concerns about athlete safety and performance in the endurance events scheduled for the championships.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Prominent Role of Boeing Aircraft in Trump Administration Trade Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 08:18:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis examines why large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in trade deals struck by the Trump administration with countries like South Korea, Japan, and the UK. Experts suggest the high-profile, high-value nature of aircraft deals provides a visible symbol of trade that benefits the president politically. These purchases allow trading partners to demonstrate a commitment to reducing their trade surpluses with the U.S. without disrupting sensitive domestic industries like agriculture or steel. Furthermore, the long delivery timelines for aircraft mean that the financial commitment is not immediate for the purchasing nations.</p>
