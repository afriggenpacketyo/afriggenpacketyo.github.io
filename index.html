            <p>In a chilling account, Sierra Friar, an 11-year-old earwitness, provided crucial testimony that implicated her sister's boyfriend in the murder of her father, Aaron Friar. The events unfolded in October 2017 when Aaron and his 15-year-old daughter, Ellie, disappeared from their Medford, Oregon home. Sierra awoke to yelling and sounds of breaking glass, later discovering blood and her family missing. Her account of seeing Ellie's forbidden boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, outside the house led to the discovery of Aaron's body and the subsequent arrest and conviction of MacFarlane and Ellie for murder conspiracy. The investigation revealed a complex web of deceit and violence within the family dynamic.</p>

            <p>A conservative investigation reveals that anti-Israel Harvard law students allegedly conspired to damage the reputations of law firms critical of campus antisemitism. The Harvard chapter of the National Lawyers Guild reportedly organized a "Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon" to gather data for editing Wikipedia pages of Big Law firms, with subsequent edits made by an account linked to a student with a history of anti-Israel advocacy.

            <p>Gary Shapley, the IRS whistleblower, was ousted as interim IRS commissioner just two days after his appointment, amidst an internal struggle involving Elon Musk. Sources indicate that Musk's backing of Shapley's appointment bypassed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authority, leading to complaints and a reversal of the decision. Shapley, known for speaking out about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax probe, will continue serving as an advisor to the Treasury Secretary.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>This article explores the use of dark humor as a coping mechanism and form of resistance in the face of political repression and authoritarianism. Drawing on historical examples from Franco's Spain to Communist East Germany, the piece argues that sardonic jokes and mockery can undermine the perceived inevitability of oppressive regimes. Laughter, as a form of self-defense, can also help individuals process and transform threatening emotions into something pleasurable, providing an outlet for both creators and audiences.</p>
