          <p>If Iran's retaliation remains limited, President Trump's high-risk strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities could yield significant gains.  The limited damage and lack of American casualties suggest a potential de-escalation.  This mirrors the 2020 situation following the killing of Qasem Soleimani, where escalation was avoided despite Iranian retaliation.</p>
