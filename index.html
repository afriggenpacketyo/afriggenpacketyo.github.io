          <p>Jennifer McCabe, a key witness in the Karen Read murder retrial, testified for a third day, recounting events surrounding the death of John O'Keefe. The prosecution alleges that Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense highlighted inconsistencies in McCabe's testimonies and Google searches. Defense attorney Alan Jackson questioned McCabe about a broken taillight on Read's SUV and a Google search for how long it takes to die in the cold. McCabe affirmed that Read asked her to search how long to die in the cold, and that she had never attempted that search before then. The trial adjourned with a forensic scientist taking the stand.</p>

          <p>After the Trump administration dismissed nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society announced a plan to publish a special collection of climate change research. This collection aims to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed, complementing the National Climate Assessment. The groups will invite scientists to submit their work, focusing on climate change in the United States. The sixth edition is scheduled for publication in 2027, and preparations have been underway for months to meet that deadline. The assessment helps federal, state and local governments and businesses to prepare for the impacts of climate change and adapt to and mitigate challenges arising from climate change.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a move described as a "radical departure from past practices." The policy change would force vaccines to undergo studies where half the participants receive a placebo for comparison. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether that includes the flu and COVID vaccines, which are updated annually. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety and argued for placebo-based trials to ensure vaccines aren't doing more harm than good.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to regulate Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals in college athletics after meeting with former Alabama head coach Nick Saban. Saban expressed concerns that the influx of money has negatively impacted college sports. Saban wants NIL payments "reformed," urging Congress to step in and make NIL "equal across the board." The NCAA recently passed rules allowing colleges to pay athletes, following a multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlement. Sen. Tommy Tuberville believes Trump can effectively regulate NIL.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming there is "no legal basis" for such a move. Harvard has stated it will resist this action, which it says would endanger its educational mission and diminish financial aid and research programs. The university's spokesperson said that there was ‚Äúno legal basis to rescind Harvard‚Äôs tax-exempt status.‚Äù Federal law prohibits the president from directing the IRS to conduct tax investigations. The intensified standoff is part of a broader pressure campaign against elite universities, which the administration accuses of antisemitism and discrimination.</p>

          <p>Weekly measles cases have reached a new record in the U.S., surpassing the peak of the 2019 outbreak, which was the worst since the 1990s. The majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now larger than any other single outbreak since the virus was eliminated. While the pace of new cases appears to be declining in Texas, officials caution that it is too soon to declare the outbreak over. This year's tally of cases is likely an undercount, and the unusually high severity suggests many mild cases are going undiagnosed. Authorities are also watching to see if travel from the Easter holiday weekend last month will result in an increase.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will cancel 35 roundtrip flights a day from its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport after experiencing significant disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby cited air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems as the cause. The flight cuts represent approximately 10% of United's daily schedule at its Newark hub. Kirby said the airline is urging the FAA to more tightly control capacity at the airport, similar to restrictions at other congested airports. He praised the Trump administration for vowing to invest and fix aging air traffic control infrastructure in the U.S.</p>

The company stated that pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model. More companies have used the loophole in recent years to ship inexpensive products directly to U.S. customers without having to pay import fees.</p>

          <p>Issa Rae and her business partners are launching Downtown Dough, a funk-inspired pizzeria in their popular Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen space. The downtown space will continue as Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen during the day, and in the evenings it will flip to Downtown Dough, a pizza joint that specializes in a kind of California-meets-Neapolitan style. The menu features wood-fired pizzas, pastas, and wood-grilled steaks, and the restaurant's decor and music are inspired by funk music from the 1970s. The trio hopes to serve the downtown community with a series of experiences.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order calling for an end to government funding for the Corp. for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which funds public media outlets. The CPB responded that the president does not have the power to cut off its funding, as Congress does. The White House is expected to request Congress claw back the $1.1 billion allocated for the CPB. NPR and PBS vowed to challenge the executive order. Experts suggest the CPB could argue the order is viewpoint discrimination. Most of the CPB funding goes to local public radio and TV stations.</p>

          <p>The White House sent a letter to Congress outlining President Trump‚Äôs proposals for government spending in the next fiscal year, calling for $163 billion in cuts that would eliminate climate, education, health and housing programs. Trump‚Äôs plan, which administration officials called a ‚Äújoint project‚Äù with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, would formalize his campaign to drastically remake the federal government. The proposal depicted many core government functions as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical. Trump said he was ‚Äòtaking away‚Äô Harvard‚Äôs tax-exempt status. Trump has adopted the contentious view that he has expansive power to dictate spending even if Congress instructs otherwise.</p>

          <p>Germany's Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution. The domestic intelligence agency said the party's understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic order. The German foreign ministry defended the decision after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the move "tyranny in disguise" and Vice-President JD Vance said the Berlin Wall was being rebuilt. The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.</p>

The PIN verification message visible in Hockstein's photo is different than what normally appears on the Signal app. The altered PIN message suggests Waltz is using software from a company called TeleMessage, which adds an archiving capability to cloned versions of messaging apps.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made big gains in English local elections, winning 677 of around 1,600 seats contested on Thursday. It won control of eight authorities from the Conservatives, and also displaced Labour in some areas. The elections in 23 councils marked the first major electoral test since Labour's landslide general election victory last year. The Tories lost over 676 seats and control of all the 16 authorities it was defending. Sir Keir Starmer said the results showed the need for his party to go "further and faster" to deliver on voters' priorities in government.</p>

Postecoglou felt the atmosphere inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium became nervous and tense after Bodo/Glimt pulled a goal back in the 84th minute, but believes his players will stay positive as they try to win silverware for the first time since 2008.

The Orb creates a digital ID for users, distinguishing them from bots or AI programs. The device doesn't store any biometric data, but stores that info on the user's device, according to World's website. The Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies. The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, as well as at gaming retailer Razer.</p>
