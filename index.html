          <p>The European Union and Mexico have voiced strong criticism of President Trump's proposal to implement a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. Mexican officials labeled the plan an "unfair deal," asserting national sovereignty, while EU leaders threatened "proportionate countermeasures" if necessary. Trump has warned that any retaliation would lead to even higher tariffs from the United States. The move escalates ongoing trade tensions and has drawn disapproval from various European leaders, who are now preparing for potential economic fallout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her sixth Grand Slam title with a decisive victory over American Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon women's final. The match was remarkably one-sided, lasting under an hour as Swiatek won 6-0, 6-0, marking the first time in 114 years a player failed to win a single game in the women's final. For Anisimova, reaching the final was a career milestone after returning from a break to address burnout. Despite the loss, her performance at the tournament is set to propel her into the top 10 rankings for the first time.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his long-standing feud with comedian Rosie O'Donnell, suggesting he is considering revoking her U.S. citizenship. In a social media post, Trump labeled O'Donnell a "Threat to Humanity" and stated she should remain in Ireland, where she recently moved. O'Donnell responded sharply, calling Trump a "criminal con man" and a "danger to our nation." The exchange marks the latest chapter in their public conflict, which dates back to 2006, though legal experts note that revoking the citizenship of a natural-born citizen is nearly impossible.</p>

          <p>The murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room in 2018 led investigators down a path involving a volatile "throuple" relationship. Seiden was involved with Zachary Abell and his long-term girlfriend, Christina Araujo, in a dynamic marked by jealousy, alcohol-fueled violence, and control. The investigation, detailed in a "48 Hours" report, revealed that the trio had embarked on a chaotic road trip that ended with Seiden's brutal death in Room 15 of the Sportsman's Lodge Motel. Ultimately, both Abell and Araujo were convicted in connection with her murder, with Araujo testifying against Abell.</p>

          <p>Britain's remaining steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are grappling with a precarious future as the industry faces decline, job losses, and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. The closure of blast furnaces at Tata Steel in Port Talbot has already cost thousands of jobs, and ongoing uncertainty over a 25% U.S. tariff on UK steel exports adds to the economic anxiety. While the UK government is negotiating to have the tariffs removed, the industry's struggles with high energy prices and decarbonization costs raise profound questions about the long-term viability of UK steel manufacturing.

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vast Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a critical source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. Thousands of miners work under the supervision of the rebel group, which claims to have brought security and order to the operation. A recent UN report, however, detailed how the M23 profits heavily from taxing the mineral, much of which is allegedly smuggled to Rwanda. The visit comes as a US-brokered ceasefire deal aims to bring stability, with potential American investment in the region's mineral wealth being a key factor.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the UK reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, largely attributed to its massive growth on social media, particularly TikTok. While TV ratings have improved, the show's online following has exploded, with many viewers consuming content through short clips, recaps, and commentary rather than watching the full daily episodes. This shift in viewing habits allows busy audiences to stay engaged with the show's discourse. However, some critics and former contestants worry that this bite-sized consumption can lead to a distorted perception of the participants.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood event along the Guadalupe River in Texas during the Fourth of July weekend has resulted in at least 129 deaths, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The disaster was caused by a massive weather system that dumped extreme rainfall on the flood-prone Hill Country, causing the river to rise with unprecedented speed. Victims include attendees of a summer camp, and a large-scale search and rescue operation is underway. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and adequacy of their emergency warnings to residents and camps in the area.</p>

The institution, run by nuns from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. The horrific discovery was first brought to light by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, whose research uncovered death certificates for hundreds of children with no corresponding burial records. The excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a long-awaited and somber reckoning for the survivors and relatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to levy 30% tariffs against both Mexico and the European Union, with the new duties set to begin on August 1.

The move represents a significant escalation in trade tensions with two of America's largest trading partners. Both Mexico and the EU have responded with criticism, with Mexico's president seeking an agreement to avoid the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as a factor contributing to China's population decline, as it begins to fulfill roles traditionally met by family, such as emotional companionship and elderly care. Many young adults, like Beijing HR manager Tracy Li, feel less pressure to marry and have children, believing technology will address future needs. While this trend is often viewed with concern, some demography experts argue it may not be entirely negative. They suggest the AI revolution could redefine fundamental concepts of life and family, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete.</p>
