            <p>President Trump has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of economic slowdown if interest rates aren't lowered immediately. Trump argues there's virtually no inflation and energy costs are declining. This comes as Trump's team explores legal options to potentially remove Powell before his term expires in May 2026, a move that experts predict would trigger market instability. Powell maintains the president lacks the authority to remove him, creating a tense standoff with potential market repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case that could impact Americans' access to free preventive healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act. The case centers on the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which determines which preventive services insurers must cover without cost-sharing. A lower court ruled that the task force's structure violates the Constitution, as its members are not appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. A decision against the ACA could limit access to life-saving care for millions.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could significantly impact access to free preventive healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The case challenges the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which determines which preventive services insurers must cover without cost to patients. Opponents argue the task force's structure violates the Constitution, potentially leading to cost-sharing for essential screenings and treatments. The Trump administration has taken over the case after the Biden administration initially filed the appeal, raising questions about its future.</p>

            <p>Companies are increasingly turning to foreign trade zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to avoid paying new tariffs imposed by President Trump. These designated sites allow importers to store goods without paying duties until they are released for U.S. consumption. The surge in interest reflects concerns about the long-term impact of the trade war, with membership in organizations like the National Association of Foreign Trade-Zones reaching all-time highs. This strategy helps companies defer duties, improve cash flow, and potentially pay lower taxes.</p>

            <p>California residents are upset about the recent introduction of a state law that enables the doubling of accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, on residential properties. As a result, the development of 38 housing units by Tricon Residential in Corona, California, is being met with strong opposition from locals. Despite petitions and local council pushback, the state law essentially permits this change with limited recourse for the community. This has raised concerns about neighborhood character, overcrowding, and the ability of local governments to respond to community concerns.</p>

The proposal aims to allow limitations on the confrontation clause for witnesses under 18 or those with mental or developmental disabilities. Concerns have been raised that this could hinder a defendant's rights, but supporters argue it's crucial to protect children from further trauma.
