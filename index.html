          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 18:19:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve announced that it would hold steady its benchmark interest rate, remaining in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision comes as the central bank assesses the economic impact of President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted rising risks to higher inflation and unemployment due to these policies, but emphasized the uncertainty of their ultimate impact. The Fed aims to maintain flexibility to either cut rates if unemployment rises or hike them if inflation reignites, signaling a cautious, wait-and-see approach amid stagflation concerns.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a boost after the Trump administration indicated its intention to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. A Department of Commerce spokesperson stated that the current rule is overly complex and would hinder American innovation, prompting a simpler replacement to ensure American AI dominance. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had previously warned of significant losses if locked out of the Chinese AI market. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need for a balance between national security and supporting the American chip industry.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded the race to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs, ending a six-month effort to overturn the election results. Griffin stated he respected the court's holding despite disagreeing with its analysis and would not appeal the decision. This concession follows a ruling by a judge appointed by President Trump, who rejected Griffin's legal challenges. Riggs will now serve an eight-year term on the Republican-majority court, boosting Democrats' chances of regaining the majority in 2028.</p>

          <p>AppLovin shares experienced a significant surge after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, alongside the announcement of selling its mobile gaming business to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash. As part of the deal, AppLovin will acquire a 20% ownership stake in Tripledot Studios. The company's first-quarter net income rose to $576 million, or $1.67 per share, compared to $234 million in the same quarter of 2024.

          <p>Following weeks of escalating tensions after a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes against Pakistan, leading to retaliatory measures and claims of victory from both sides. India emphasized that its actions were limited and targeted, aiming to quell public anger without seeking further escalation. Pakistan, while asserting its ability to inflict damage, also signaled a desire to avoid all-out war due to economic constraints. Diplomats and analysts hope that the day's events may offer an offramp, allowing both nations to de-escalate amid international calls for restraint.</p>

          <p>A New York Times opinion article argues that the current charitable tax deduction system in the United States disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the charities they support, such as museums and universities, while providing little to no benefit for lower-income donors and their local community groups. The author proposes replacing the current system with a tax incentive that is determined by the amount of the donation, rather than the donor's income, such as a government matching system or a tax credit, to create a more equitable distribution of federal subsidies for charitable giving.</p>

          <p>The US House of Representatives passed a bill that could severely restrict partnerships between American and Chinese universities, preventing US universities from receiving Department of Homeland Security funding if they have a relationship with certain Chinese universities. The bill, which passed with bipartisan support, aims to address concerns about Chinese influence within the United States. While supporters argue it protects against malign purposes, others warn of potential overreach that could hinder legitimate academic activity.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., warning that cuts to the agency could severely impact the Indian Health Service (IHS).

They urged the secretary to ensure that IHS programs have the necessary resources and staffing to fulfill their missions.</p>
