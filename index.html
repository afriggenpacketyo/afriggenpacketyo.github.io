          <p>A new Realtor.com report indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in some parts of the United States, particularly in the South and West. This trend is largely driven by increased housing inventory in these regions, creating a more balanced market after years of intense competition. In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience tight inventory and rising prices, with cities like Milwaukee and New York seeing significant increases since 2022. The report highlights a divided market where buyer experiences vary greatly by location. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to cancel approximately $7 billion in grant funding previously awarded under the Solar for All program. This initiative, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was designed to help low- and middle-income households install solar panels. Since the funds have already been awarded to 60 entities, the move to terminate the grants is legally complex and expected to face court challenges. This action is part of a broader administration effort to scale back clean energy programs and subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is preparing to seek federal hate crime charges against Elias Rodriguez, the man accused of killing two Israeli Embassy employees in Washington, D.C. A source familiar with the case indicated the indictment will likely include special findings that would permit prosecutors to seek the death penalty. Rodriguez is already facing charges including first-degree murder for the shooting of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim in May. After the incident, he reportedly told police he acted "for Palestine," prompting the investigation into a hate crime motive.</p>

          <p>Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love has shared that he considered quitting football at age 14 following his father's suicide. In an article for "The Players Tribune," Love described how his mother convinced him to play for just one more year, a decision he credits with saving him. He explained that while he wasn't a star player at the time, the sport provided an escape and a sense of camaraderie that helped him through a dark period. Love emphasized the crucial role his family and the brotherhood of football played in his journey to the NFL.</p>

          <p>A law firm representing victims of childhood sexual abuse is calling for a federal investigation into Los Angeles County's probation department and foster care system. This follows a $4 billion settlement by the county to resolve thousands of abuse cases, yet the firm argues there has been no criminal accountability for the perpetrators. Attorney John Manly, who is not part of the settlement, described the juvenile facilities as "dens of sexual predation" and is pushing for a U.S. Attorney's Office probe. The call for an investigation aims to uncover who was responsible for the systemic failures that allowed widespread abuse to occur for decades.</p>

Both Vance and Rubio, once critics of Trump, have since become strong allies, though both have been publicly reserved about their 2028 presidential ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to launch a pilot program to test coverage for expensive weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound under Medicare and Medicaid. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans with obesity who currently cannot afford the treatments, which cost around $1,000 per month. While Medicare covers these GLP-1 drugs for diabetes, coverage for obesity has been a major barrier. The plan, which could start in 2026, is seen as a potential major victory for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk by boosting sales volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that major banks are engaging in "debanking," or closing the accounts of clients based on their political views, alleging he was personally targeted by JPMorgan Chase. The issue has become a point of contention for some conservatives who feel they are unfairly denied financial services, though banks maintain that account closures are based on risk assessments and regulatory compliance. While federal law often prevents banks from disclosing the specific reasons for closure, such as a suspicious activity report, critics argue the practice lacks transparency. Banking executives have denied that political beliefs are a factor in their decisions.</p>

          <p>Tennessee has carried out the execution of Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, without deactivating his implanted heart defibrillator, despite legal challenges over the potential for unnecessary pain. Black's attorneys had argued the device could shock his heart as the lethal injection took effect, but the state supreme court overturned a lower court's order to have it turned off. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. His lawyer condemned the execution, calling it the "brutal and unchecked abuse of government power" against a man they argued was frail and intellectually disabled.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed five of the eight members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, the body created by Congress to manage the territory's fiscal crisis. A White House official stated the board had been run "inefficiently and ineffectively" and that it was time for "common sense leadership." Four of the fired members were appointed by Democratic presidents. The board, established under the PROMESA Act, has been working to restructure Puerto Rico's massive debt, but progress has been slow, particularly regarding the island's power authority.</p>

          <p>Authorities in California are preparing for a prolonged heat wave that threatens to worsen several large wildfires already burning in the state and increase the fire risk statewide. An intense warming trend is expected to bring triple-digit temperatures to many inland areas, drying out vegetation and creating dangerous conditions. The Gifford fire, now the state's largest of the year, continues to burn along the Central Coast, while crews also battle the Rosa and Gold fires in Southern California. Officials warn that while strong winds are not forecast, the combination of extreme heat and low humidity can help fires start and grow uncontrollably.</p>

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the dominant figure in Romania's transition from communism to democracy, has passed away at the age of 95. Iliescu rose to power during the chaotic 1989 revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and served three terms as president. He is credited with steering the nation toward eventual NATO and EU membership, but his legacy remains deeply divisive. He was heavily criticized for his role in the violent suppression of protests in the 1990s, known as the Mineriads, and for a perceived reluctance to fully break from the country's communist past and its culture of corruption.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's persistent use of the term "Russia hoax" to describe the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It argues that while the phrase has no fixed meaning, the underlying events were not a hoax, citing the U.S. intelligence community's consensus that Russia meddled to help Trump. The article acknowledges that some of the more extreme rumors, like those in the Steele dossier, were false, and that the Mueller report's landing was complex. However, it concludes that the "hoax" narrative itself is a successful political tool aimed at distracting from the well-documented actions of the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>

Hinge also provided a strong revenue forecast for the third quarter and the full year, signaling continued growth. While the company posted a large net loss, it was primarily due to stock-based compensation expenses related to its recent IPO, and investors responded positively to the strong top-line performance.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. This move will allow a panel of citizens to decide if formal charges should be filed against individuals who may have conspired to falsely accuse Donald Trump of colluding with Russia. The action follows recent allegations from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that Obama-era officials politicized intelligence to target Trump. This development reinvigorates the long-running political battle over the legitimacy of the initial investigation into Russian election interference.</p>

The Democrats fled to prevent a vote on a new congressional map, led by President Trump, which could give Republicans up to five additional seats. Governor Greg Abbott has vowed to remove the absent members from office, citing a nonbinding attorney general opinion, though legal experts say this is unlikely to succeed.
