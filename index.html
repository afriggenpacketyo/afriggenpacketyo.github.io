          <p>Elon Musk's recent comments at a London rally organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson have drawn sharp criticism from UK political figures. Speaking via video link, Musk warned of "uncontrolled migration" and stated, "violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die." Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood labeled his language "abhorrent," while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called him "deeply irresponsible." The incident has prompted calls for the government to review any potential contracts with Musk's companies, highlighting the tension between free speech and inflammatory rhetoric from influential public figures.</p>

          <p>In a clear demonstration of escalating space-based reconnaissance, a Chinese satellite has photographed a US satellite that was itself observing Chinese space assets. China's Jilin-1 satellite captured images of the American WorldView Legion satellite, a move that follows a similar action by the US company Maxar Intelligence, which had previously released images of China's Shijian-26 satellite. This exchange highlights the growing strategic competition in orbit, where nations are increasingly using advanced commercial and military satellites to monitor each other's activities. The incident underscores a new era of dynamic, real-time observation and counter-observation in space.</p>

          <p>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has sharply criticized the club's recent performance and transfer strategy under manager Ruben Amorim. Scholes argues that the team lacks the necessary quality to execute Amorim's 3-4-3 formation, leading to their worst league start since the 1992-93 season. Despite a £200m investment in forwards, the team has struggled to score goals. While senior club officials reportedly remain supportive of Amorim's long-term vision, Scholes and other former players like Wayne Rooney are urging a change in tactics to salvage the season, as pressure continues to mount on the manager.</p>

She expressed that growing up in the Mormon Church, where sex is a taboo subject, has instilled a sense of guilt, but she is now trying to reconcile those values with the realities of the dating show's format as she moves into the public spotlight.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance has advocated for holding individuals who celebrate the act accountable by reporting them to their employers. Guest-hosting Kirk's podcast, Vance stated that while political violence is unacceptable, civility must be maintained, and that those expressing joy over the assassination should face consequences. This call to action comes as several individuals, including pilots and a Secret Service employee, have already been suspended or fired for inappropriate social media posts about Kirk's death. The situation has ignited a debate over free speech versus accountability for inflammatory online behavior.</p>

Patel posted on X that a suspect was in custody, only to retract the statement less than two hours later when the individual was released, a move that drew concern from FBI veterans about compromising an active case. Defending his actions as a commitment to transparency, Patel's approach marks a stark departure from the traditionally cautious communication style of the FBI.

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California is tied with Louisiana for the highest poverty rate in the nation, at 17.7%. This means approximately 7 million Californians lack the resources to meet their basic needs, a situation largely driven by the state's exceptionally high housing costs. The poverty rate has risen sharply from a historic low of 11% in 2021, a decline attributed to temporary pandemic-era public benefits that have since expired. The analysis underscores the paradox of California's immense wealth coexisting with a severe and growing poverty crisis, particularly affecting renters, children, and minority populations.</p>

Campaigners, including families of the 97 victims, have welcomed the news, seeing it as a landmark step toward accountability.

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, driven by widespread voter concern over the city's unaffordability. The poll shows voters prioritize a candidate who can bring change over one with experience, which benefits Mamdani. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo performs better among voters whose top issue is crime, but economic concerns currently dominate the electorate. The survey also reveals that many voters want a mayor who will oppose President Trump, a sentiment that overwhelmingly favors Mamdani, while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trails far behind with low approval ratings.</p>

          <p>Costco has issued an urgent recall for its Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene due to a risk of the bottles shattering spontaneously. The company is advising customers who purchased the product in several Midwestern states between April and August 2025 not to return the item to the store. Instead, they are instructed to dispose of it safely by wrapping the bottle in paper towels, placing it in a plastic bag, and then in the trash. This unusual measure underscores the severity of the danger posed by the faulty bottles, and affected customers can receive a full refund by presenting their notice letter at a Costco store.</p>

          <p>While President Trump claims his deployment of federal forces has made Washington, D.C., a "CRIME FREE ZONE," this article argues the crackdown may be counterproductive in the long run. The heavy presence of National Guard and federal agents has reportedly hurt local businesses, as workers and tourists stay away. Furthermore, the strategy has redirected funds from community-based violence prevention programs and is eroding trust between residents and local police, who were forced to cooperate with agencies like ICE. Critics fear that once the federal surge ends, the city could face a rebound in crime exacerbated by damaged community relations and a weakened local economy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, an idea he claims would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. In a Truth Social post, he suggested the change would be subject to SEC approval and contrasted the U.S. short-term focus with China's long-term view. The concept has been previously supported by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who argued against quarterly guidance. While supporters of the current system praise its transparency, a shift could be implemented by the SEC without congressional action. (not investment advice)</p>

After announcing his intention to run earlier this month on a platform of "real change," McGregor stated that he made the decision after consulting with his family. In his withdrawal announcement on X, he criticized Ireland's political rules, claiming the system is "fixed" to favor establishment candidates and creates a "democratic deficit." To appear on the ballot, a candidate requires a nomination from 20 members of parliament or four local authorities, a hurdle that has proven challenging for independent contenders.</p>

This milestone was propelled by a recent favorable antitrust ruling where the penalties were less severe than investors had feared, causing the stock to rally.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers its first interest rate cut since December 2024, this article explains its indirect but significant influence on mortgage rates. The Fed sets the short-term federal funds rate, but fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to long-term instruments like the 10-year Treasury note. While a Fed cut doesn't guarantee an immediate drop in mortgage costs, lenders often price in anticipated changes, which is why rates have already slightly decreased. Ultimately, mortgage rates are affected by a combination of factors including inflation expectations, economic growth, and investor sentiment in the bond market. (not investment advice)</p>
