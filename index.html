          <p>Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, has addressed the profound grief within the club following the tragic death of player Diogo Jota and his brother in a car crash. Slot encouraged his players to process their emotions authentically, whether through tears or laughter, as they navigate their loss. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt and planned several tributes, including a minute's silence at their next match. The team, family, and fans have gathered at Anfield to pay their respects, creating a communal space for mourning a player remembered for his significant contributions and vibrant personality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's presidential actions suggests his self-proclaimed dealmaking style is more accurately described as a strategy of coercion and ultimatums. This approach is evident in his recent imposition of tariffs on trading partners, pressure on the Federal Reserve, and investigations into universities to force policy changes. Critics argue this method erodes democratic institutions by undermining their autonomy and replacing negotiation with domination. Conversely, allies view it as a necessary tactic to fulfill his electoral agenda against what they see as a hostile political environment, but it raises concerns about long-term institutional credibility.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has died after an incident in the River Kelvin in Glasgow, with his body recovered late at night by emergency services. The tragedy occurred on what was Scotland's hottest day in two years, with temperatures reaching 32.2C in the Highlands. On the same day, a 63-year-old woman also died after a fall near a waterfall in East Dunbartonshire. Authorities have stated that neither death is being treated as suspicious and have urged the public to exercise caution outdoors during the extreme heat, which has now subsided.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Shanghai, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reiterated his country's long-standing and consistent position on Taiwan. He stated that Australia supports the existing status quo and is against any unilateral actions that would alter it, emphasizing a desire for peace and security in the region. This statement comes amid reports that a U.S. defense official has been pressing Australian and Japanese counterparts on their potential roles in a Taiwan conflict. China, which claims sovereignty over the democratically governed island, views Taiwan as a key domestic issue, making regional security a critical topic for Albanese's visit.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is calling for the European Union to firmly defend its interests and prepare for a potential trade war following Donald Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports. Macron urged the European Commission to accelerate the development of credible countermeasures if a deal is not reached. This stance contrasts with more cautious calls for a pragmatic solution from leaders in Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The threat has caused shock and division within the bloc, with industry groups, particularly Germany's automotive sector, expressing deep concern over the potential economic impact of such a significant tariff hike.</p>

The state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) announced the milestone, highlighting the project's innovative approach which it describes as green, safe, and efficient. This new mining technique, focused on sandstone-type deposits, reportedly avoids the need for tunnels and prevents the creation of toxic waste. The development is expected to significantly enhance China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium market and support its expanding nuclear energy sector.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that five years after the George Floyd uprisings, the systemic changes demanded by protesters have not materialized. Instead of transformation, the response has been largely symbolic, while police budgets have increased and a new era of authoritarianism has taken hold, accelerated by the Trump administration. The authors contend that tactics of repression, once used on marginalized communities, are now being expanded to suppress any dissent. They criticize both political parties for contributing to this system and call for continued grassroots organizing to build community-based safety and resist state control, asserting that the fight for justice is far from over.</p>

          <p>A sustained campaign of immigration raids by ICE in Los Angeles has instilled a deep sense of fear in immigrant communities and taken a significant economic toll on local businesses. In neighborhoods like MacArthur Park, a recent show of force by federal agents has led many residents to stay home, causing business at local restaurants and shops to plummet. Advocates and lawyers accuse federal agents of targeting individuals based on their appearance, and a judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the sweeps. The raids have resulted in nearly 2,800 arrests, disrupting families and leaving communities in a state of constant anxiety.</p>

          <p>A landmark 2023 civil rights settlement designed to address a decades-old raw sewage crisis in Lowndes County, Alabama, has been terminated by the Trump administration. The administration labeled the agreement an illegal Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiative, stripping away the federal mandate and funding for the state to fix failing sanitation systems that affect a majority-Black and high-poverty population. This decision reverses a Justice Department finding of environmental racism and places the responsibility back on state lawmakers.

          <p>Despite being the most disaster-prone state in the U.S., Texas exhibits a political culture that consistently prioritizes post-disaster recovery over proactive preparation. The recent deadly flash floods in the Hill Country highlight this pattern, following similar governmental inaction after Hurricane Ike in 2008 and the 2021 winter storm Uri. Experts attribute this reluctance to a combination of small-government ideology, climate change skepticism, and the powerful influence of the fossil fuel industry on state politics. This approach leaves the state's growing population increasingly vulnerable to the escalating frequency and intensity of extreme weather events driven by the climate crisis.</p>

Despite this shift in on-screen representation, the show's production has been criticized for its opaque handling of off-screen issues. Two contestants were removed after past use of racial slurs surfaced, but these reasons were not explicitly stated to the audience, highlighting a continued reluctance within the reality TV genre to directly address issues of racism.</p>

The plan also includes a £25 million allocation for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies," enabling residents without driveways to install charge points. This initiative aims to address two major barriers to EV adoption: high upfront costs and the lack of accessible charging infrastructure for many households across the country.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza has killed ten people, including six children, according to emergency officials. Eyewitnesses reported that a drone fired a missile into a crowd of people who were queuing with jerry cans to collect water from a tanker. The attack also left 16 others injured, many of them children. This incident is part of an escalation in Israeli aerial attacks across the Gaza Strip. The International Committee of the Red Cross also reported a surge in mass casualty events at its Rafah field hospital, underscoring the horrific conditions faced by civilians.</p>

          <h2>One Year After Trump Rally Shooting, a Look at the Security Breakdown and Subsequent Reforms</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A year after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, which resulted in the death of a firefighter, the incident is remembered as a catastrophic security failure for the U.S. Secret Service. Multiple investigations revealed systemic issues, including lapses in intelligence sharing and coordination. In response, the Secret Service has outlined 37 reform measures, though many require congressional action and funding. Experts trace some of the agency's challenges back to its post-9/11 restructuring, which expanded its mission without a proportional increase in resources, leading to persistent staffing and budget constraints that were flagged in reports years before the shooting.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the event's political shockwaves continue to reverberate through American politics. The article suggests Trump's survival and defiant reaction, raising a fist with blood on his face, solidified his image as a divinely protected leader for his supporters and may have contributed to his zealous governing style. The incident also created a stark contrast with then-President Joe Biden, whose subsequent withdrawal from the race left the Democratic party in disarray. The shooting is viewed as a pivotal moment that intensified a culture of political violence and set the stage for Trump's return to power.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in central Texas, multiple federal urban search and rescue teams reported that they were not deployed by FEMA until days after the disaster, well after any survivors were likely to be found. This delay has frustrated some FEMA officials and lawmakers, who point to a new rule requiring the DHS Secretary to approve small expenditures as a potential bureaucratic hurdle. The Trump administration's vision for FEMA involves states taking the lead in disaster response, but critics worry this approach slowed down the federal response at a critical time and could be detrimental in states with fewer resources.</p>

          <p>Relations between China and India are strained following a dispute over the succession of the 14th Dalai Lama. The conflict was ignited by comments from a senior Indian minister asserting that only the Dalai Lama and his established institution can identify his successor. Beijing, which views the Dalai Lama as a separatist, lodged a formal protest, insisting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition. This diplomatic friction, further highlighted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader, threatens to undermine a recent, fragile thaw in relations between the two neighboring powers.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectronic controllers into moon jellyfish, allowing them to remotely guide the creatures to collect environmental data. This innovative approach could redefine ocean monitoring by providing a low-cost, scalable alternative to expensive underwater robots. Since jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane, and they can heal quickly after the device is removed. The team is now working on improving the device's durability for deep-sea pressures and adding steering capabilities, hoping to make advanced ocean research more accessible to labs worldwide.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece uses the release of the new "Superman" movie to lament a perceived absence of real-world heroes and integrity in American public life, particularly in politics. The author argues that society has become confused by on-screen superheroes, trading enduring public service for flimsy celebrity. The article specifically criticizes several Republican lawmakers for voting for the "Big Beautiful Bill," which adds trillions to the national debt, after previously railing against deficit spending. This reversal is presented as an example of political cowardice and self-interest, contrasting sharply with the ideals of "Truth, Justice, and the American Way" that Superman represents.</p>

          <p>This sports column suggests that LeBron James, now playing on a one-year contract with the Lakers for the first time in his career, could look to Kobe Bryant's retirement as a model for his own eventual exit from the NBA. The author notes that Bryant's decision to announce his retirement at the start of his final season allowed him to control the narrative and led to a celebrated farewell tour. With the Lakers now seemingly building around Luka Dončić, James's future with the team is uncertain.

          <p>In response to its severe housing and homelessness crises, California is creating a new state agency focused exclusively on these issues. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, will split the current Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency into two separate entities. Supporters believe this reorganization will elevate housing to a cabinet-level priority and is a crucial first step toward streamlining the state's complex and fragmented affordable housing finance system. While the new agency aims to bring more order, key funding programs will remain under the control of the state's independently elected treasurer, presenting a challenge for complete consolidation.</p>

Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York note that cautious hiring by employers amid economic uncertainty and job cuts in sectors like government and tech have reduced opportunities. While the overall unemployment rate is low, fewer people are quitting their jobs, limiting openings for new entrants. Career experts advise graduates to be flexible, as even a non-ideal first job can provide valuable skills and serve as a stepping stone to a more rewarding career.</p>
