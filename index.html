            <p>Despite escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, certain Chinese biotech companies are experiencing growth. These companies, such as Pacific Shuanglin Bio-pharmacy and Beijing Tiantan Biological Products, have seen their stocks rise following China's imposition of tariffs on U.S. plasma products, a crucial component in medical treatments. China relies heavily on imports to meet its albumin demand, used for treating trauma and liver diseases, and these tariffs are expected to boost the market share of domestic manufacturers.

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that restricts their access to government buildings and contracts. This action follows the firm's successful representation of Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation case against Fox News, where they secured a significant settlement. Susman Godfrey argues that the executive order is a retaliatory measure designed to punish them for defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election and represents an abuse of presidential power.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, can be deported based on a Trump-era immigration law. The government argues that Khalil's presence in the US poses adverse foreign policy consequences due to his involvement in protests against the war in Gaza. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal, arguing that his activism is protected speech and that he is being unfairly targeted for his views.

The US relies on commodity exports from countries like South Africa and Nigeria, but trade between the US and Africa remains small. Some African nations, particularly those with clothing manufacturing industries, could be seriously affected by the tariffs. Trump announced he would pause the “reciprocal tariffs” for 90 days for most countries, but hit China harder with additional tariffs to a cumulative rate of 145 per cent this year.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, which is at risk of closure. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, employs 2,700 people and is the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The government is weighing options to protect the site, including emergency legislation to assume control of operations. The company says the plant continues to lose £700,000 a day despite £1.2bn of investment.</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system has caused delays and confusion in the implementation of new tariffs. The glitch, which lasted for more than 10 hours, affected the code used to exempt freight from new tariffs. Customs has advised filers to transmit cargo release separately and follow up with the summary filing when resolved. The incident raises questions about Customs' ability to handle the rapidly changing tariff policy.</p>
