          <p>A group of Yale University classmates penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, expressing deep concerns about his role in the Trump administration and its potential descent into authoritarianism. The letter, signed by over 140 alumni, cites actions by the administration that they believe undermine democratic principles and the Constitution, including punitive attacks on media and illegal seizure of people. Bessent responded by criticizing the signatories as close-minded progressives and affirming his commitment to serving in the Trump administration, viewing it as an honor. Optimism Score: 20</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department has revoked a Biden-era policy that protected journalists from subpoenas and compelled testimony in leak investigations. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the policy change is necessary to prevent federal employees from leaking sensitive information, which she views as undermining the rule of law and national security. The new policy allows for subpoenas and court orders to obtain information from journalists, with certain restrictions, including approval from DOJ leadership and advance notice to journalists. This marks a return to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations used during the Trump and Obama administrations. Optimism Score: 30</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office allegedly established a system allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. A computer monitor in his office provides remote access to Signal and text messages from his personal cellphone, despite cellphones being prohibited in the secure facility. Critics argue this workaround poses a security risk, giving Hegseth access to his personal communications at his desk. This follows reports that Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen via Signal with individuals lacking a clear need-to-know, raising further security concerns.

          <p>Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer warned governors that states allowing undocumented immigrants to collect unemployment benefits risk losing federal funding. She emphasized that unemployment benefits are intended for legally authorized workers who are able and available to work.

          <p>California is projected to run out of its current license plate number and letter combinations by 2026, prompting a change to a new sequence. The new format will consist of three numerals, followed by three letters, and one numeral (e.g., "000AAA0"). The state's rapid rate of issuing new plates, driven by fears of increased car prices due to trade wars, has accelerated the exhaustion of the current system, which began in 1980.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel announced the arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on obstruction charges for allegedly preventing the arrest of an undocumented immigrant during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was later arrested. The incident sparked debate over judicial activism and immigration enforcement, with Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin criticizing the arrest as a concerning pattern of undermining checks on presidential power.

          <p>A judge criticized lawyers representing MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell for submitting a court document containing errors and using artificial intelligence. The document, filed in a lawsuit against Lindell by a former Dominion Voting Services employee, included non-existent case citations. Lindell's attorney admitted using generative AI in the document. The judge ordered Lindell's attorneys to justify why the court should not impose sanctions and refer them to disciplinary proceedings. The attorney claimed the brief filed was a draft submitted mistakenly and that he routinely uses AI tools to analyze arguments. Optimism Score: 60</p>
