        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, addressed investor concerns regarding the company's high capital expenditure plans, which are projected to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for the year. Intrator explained that these expenditures are driven by strong demand signals from major clients, including OpenAI, who are requesting infrastructure at an accelerated pace. He reassured investors that financing remains robust and that CoreWeave is capable of repaying lenders within the terms of its contracts, citing their understanding of the company's business model and contracts. The company's financial strength is underlined by major deals with technology clients like Microsoft and Nvidia, signaling continued growth and confidence in its AI server rental business.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed mega-bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, faces potential defeat due to opposition from several Republican hard-liners.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to sway holdouts, focusing on key components like Medicaid and tax reform, particularly the contentious SALT caps.

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, citing that the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone. Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants could not be charged with trespassing because they were unaware they were entering the restricted area. The immigrants still face charges for crossing the border illegally, but the dismissal marks a setback for efforts to increase penalties for unlawful crossings. The so-called New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles of the border, authorizing US army troops to detain immigrants.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could start seeing higher prices on goods due to tariffs, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. He stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too significant for retailers and suppliers to absorb, and the effects will likely be seen towards the end of the month and more substantially in June. While Walmart beat quarterly earnings expectations, the company declined to provide specific earnings guidance for the fiscal second quarter due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Despite these challenges, Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally.</p>

Trump has defended the cost, stating it is "peanuts compared to the value of doing it," while Democrats have criticized the event as wasteful.

          <p>The article discusses the Trump administration's increasing reliance on officials holding multiple positions, a practice known as dual-hatting, due to difficulties in finding or willingness to appoint individuals to specific roles. Examples include Todd Blanche serving as both deputy attorney general and acting Librarian of Congress, and Marco Rubio holding positions as secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist, and acting national security advisor. This practice raises concerns about potential dysfunction, conflicts of interest, and incompetence as leaders are stretched thin and qualified individuals are overlooked, potentially weakening critical institutions like the National Archives.</p>

          <p>An easing in President Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods gave businesses some breathing room, but long-term planning is still on pause. For many businesses, especially small ones, 30 percent is still a crippling burden, and even Walmart said that it would have to raise prices on some items in response to tariff-fueled cost increases. Small businesses are responding to the change in a variety of ways, from cutting the cheapest items to splitting the cost with vendors and manufacturers. The 90-day pause “may temporarily help unstick the effective trade embargo that has been in place,” but a long-term deal is needed to make long-term trade, investment and sourcing decisions.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Thursday regarding President Trump's bid to end birthright citizenship, focusing on whether lower court judges should have the power to block presidential orders nationwide. Justices across the ideological spectrum questioned both the lower courts' authority to issue nationwide injunctions and the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself. The US solicitor general argued for curtailing lower courts' power, while opponents contended that siding with Trump would create a chaotic, patchwork system of citizenship. Protests took place outside the court as the justices considered the case.</p>

A pre-show featuring the Muppets has been well-received, as it provides comedic relief without forcing happiness. The 70th anniversary celebrations include other jovial events, such as a projection show on It’s a Small World and a new show for tots framed around throwing a house party.</p>

          <p>The article explores the internal conflicts at OpenAI, particularly surrounding the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the leadership of CEO Sam Altman. It details how co-founder Ilya Sutskever, concerned about the potential dangers of AGI, suggested building a bunker to protect core scientists. Sutskever and Mira Murati ultimately approached the board with concerns about Altman's leadership, leading to his brief ouster. The altruistic ideals of OpenAI have eroded, and the company has become more focused on commercialization, leading to a power struggle among elites shaping the future of AI development.</p>

A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in the bill approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, and it boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process. Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.</p>
