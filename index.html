        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough dealt a blow to Senate Republicans by ruling that a key Medicaid provision in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is out of order. The provision, which cracks down on states' use of healthcare provider taxes to collect additional Medicaid funding, doesn't comply with the rules governing the bill. This ruling requires Republicans to rework or scrap the provision to pass the bill with only GOP votes, posing a significant setback given the approaching July 4th deadline. This development necessitates major revisions to the legislation within a limited timeframe. Optimism is tempered by the potential for legislative gridlock.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" proposes requiring Medicaid recipients in 40 states and D.C. to work, volunteer, or attend school for at least 80 hours a month. Some Medicaid enrollees with disabilities worry about the reporting process, while others believe there is too much abuse in the system. Studies show most working-age enrollees already work or have valid reasons for not working, while the CBO estimates millions could lose coverage due to the requirement. The debate highlights concerns about access to healthcare and the impact of bureaucratic hurdles on vulnerable populations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The MAGA movement envisions an ideal American family with many children, a working father, and a stay-at-home mother, but achieving this vision would be costly. Republicans have proposed policies like opening public lands for housing and changing the tax code to encourage stay-at-home parenting. However, experts argue that these measures are insufficient to reverse trends in women's employment and rising costs of living. Some suggest paying mothers a million dollars to compensate for giving up their careers, but this would be incredibly expensive and impact the American economy. </p>

          <p>Closing arguments are being presented in the sexual assault trial against Sean "Diddy" Combs, with prosecutors arguing that Combs used "power, violence and fear" to run a criminal enterprise. Combs has denied the allegations, which include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges, and he faces a potential life sentence if convicted. The prosecution rested after calling 34 witnesses, including Cassie Ventura Fine, who testified about being pressured into participating in drug-fueled "freak-offs". The defense argued that Ventura Fine was a willing participant, but prosecutors maintain that Combs used his influence to orchestrate the events.</p>

Consumer spending also slowed significantly, reaching its lowest level since the pandemic.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of South Carolina, allowing the state to block Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood. The court found that Planned Parenthood and a patient cannot sue the state under federal civil rights law to enforce the Medicaid Act's provider choice provision. The ruling reverses a lower court decision and is expected to enable more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. Justice Jackson dissented, arguing the decision weakens civil rights protections.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that states may exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from providing healthcare to women on Medicaid, reversing the rule that Medicaid patients can choose any qualified provider. The court's conservative majority decided that the Medicaid Act does not grant patients an individual right to their provider of choice. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing the decision deprives Medicaid recipients of their right to choose their healthcare provider. The ruling could significantly impact access to services like cancer screenings and contraception for low-income women.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s revamped government panel recommended the use of Merck's RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, offering a temporary reprieve for public health officials. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted to include the shot in the government's list of recommended childhood immunizations. While two vaccine critics on the panel questioned its safety, other members emphasized the shot's safety and effectiveness. The signoff will allow Merck to launch the shot ahead of the RSV season.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief negotiator departed for another round of tariff negotiations with the United States, reaffirming that the 25 percent additional auto tariffs imposed by Washington remain unacceptable. Ryosei Akazawa, minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy, hopes to convince the United States to reconsider the duty, especially as the 90-day pause on part of the reciprocal tariffs expires on July 9. The negotiations aim to address trade imbalances and ensure fair competition.</p>

          <h2>US Economy Performs Worse Than Estimated in First Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 09:59:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US economy contracted more than previously estimated in the first three months of this year, with real gross domestic product falling by 0.5%. The decline primarily reflects downward revisions to consumer spending and exports, influenced by a surge in imports due to President Trump's tariffs. Economists anticipate a rebound in the second quarter, but the tariff situation adds uncertainty. The trade war has pushed China and the European Union into seeking new trade partners.</p>
