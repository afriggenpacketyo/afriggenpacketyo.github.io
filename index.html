        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes an increase to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000. This change, part of President Trump's tax package, would primarily benefit residents in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The proposal may face challenges in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Department of Education. The judge's ruling prevents the planned reduction-in-force (RIF) and the transfer of federal student loans and special education functions out of the department. The judge stated that the RIF would likely cripple the department, which was already struggling to meet its goals. The ruling requires all fired federal employees from the department to be reinstated. The Elon Musk-helmed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, previously slashed nearly $1 billion in funding from the department and terminated dozens of contracts and grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has hit a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

The cryptocurrency has seen strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and a significant increase in Bitcoin holdings by public companies. Favorable U.S. crypto regulation, supported by President Trump, and JPMorgan's decision to allow clients to buy Bitcoin have also contributed to the rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The English government has announced a 4% pay rise for most doctors and teachers, accepting recommendations from pay review bodies. While education unions have welcomed the decision, they warn of potential budget cuts without additional funding. Health unions, however, have reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives. The announcement comes as inflation unexpectedly rose to 3.5%, complicating perceptions of the offers' generosity.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, potentially impacting the state's plan to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. The move was made possible by the Congressional Review Act. Republicans argue that the waivers amount to forcing consumers to purchase vehicles they may not want. Democrats argue that the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board chairwoman from 1975-1982 said that if Congress uses Congressional Review to revoke the waivers, the state of California will sue the federal government.</p>

States and cities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are heading into hurricane season with an extraordinary level of uncertainty, unable to gauge how significant cuts at vital federal agencies will affect weather forecasts, emergency response and long-term recovery. FEMA has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, including one-fifth of the coordinating officers who manage responses to large-scale disasters, according to a former senior official. Many of those employees made their own decision to leave.</p>

Warmer sea temperatures – made more likely by climate change - and generally favourable atmospheric conditions, are behind the forecast.

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. Home Office statistics showed there were 32,345 asylum seekers living in taxpayer-funded hotels in March 2025, down from 38,079 in December 2024. Ministers hope that speeding-up, coupled with the evolving measures to combat cross-channel boats, will ultimately slash the numbers in hotels.</p>
