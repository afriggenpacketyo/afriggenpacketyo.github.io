          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has suspended three recently elected Labour MPs, removing the party whip and forcing them to sit as independents. While the specific reasons remain undisclosed, the move is linked to a recent rebellion where 47 Labour MPs, including the three suspended, voted against the government's welfare reform bill. This disciplinary action occurs as Starmer seeks to assert his authority following a series of challenging policy reversals.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, reporting earnings of $2.13 per share against an expected $1.96. The strong performance was driven by a significant increase in trading revenues, particularly in equities, and robust growth in its wealth management division. Despite the positive earnings report and a 13% rise in net income, the bank's stock experienced a slight dip in trading. (not investment advice)</p>

The system links federal immigration records with Social Security data, a move the senators warn could disenfranchise eligible voters and was rolled out without required public transparency.
