          <p>A recent survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology highlights a surprising trend among American high school students, with nearly one in five reporting they or someone they know has used AI for a romantic relationship. The study also found that almost half of the students surveyed use AI to discuss emotions and mental health, often feeling more comfortable with a chatbot than with parents or friends. This development has raised concerns among experts and parents about the potential negative impacts on communication skills and empathy, as well as the dangers of AI giving harmful advice or being used to create deepfake content for bullying.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Tim Curry reflected on his five-decade career, his iconic roles like Dr. Frank-N-Furter in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," and his new memoir, "Vagabond." Curry discussed how acting provided an escape from a difficult childhood and how his villainous characters often channeled his past experiences. He also spoke candidly about the major stroke he suffered in 2012, which left him partially paralyzed and required him to relearn how to speak. Now 79, Curry maintains a philosophical outlook on life and mortality, expressing that he does not fear death and has worked to avoid self-pity throughout his recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military launched aircraft and artillery strikes against targets in southern Gaza, stating the action was a response to Hamas firing on its soldiers in an Israeli-controlled area. An Israeli military official described the incidents, which included a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire, as a "bold violation of the ceasefire" brokered by the U.S. earlier in the month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take strong action against any violations, though he did not threaten a full return to war. Hamas denied involvement, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and stating it had no knowledge of any clashes in the specified area.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of committing "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty after a U.S. strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters. The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. had struck a "drug-carrying submarine," killing two people. Petro claims the vessel was a fishing boat adrift with engine failure, and that the deceased, Alejandro Carranza, was a fisherman with no drug trade ties. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly U.S. strikes on ships in the Caribbean, which the Trump administration defends as necessary to stop drug flow but which UN experts have called "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance marked the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, with an event that featured a large-scale live artillery demonstration. The exercise prompted criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who cited public safety risks and closed a portion of a major interstate due to the loud explosions. During his speech, Vance, a Marine veteran, praised the military, criticized Democratic policies, and attacked what he termed "woke" diversity initiatives within the armed forces. Vance's office dismissed Newsom's safety concerns, accusing the governor of attempting to undermine military readiness for political reasons.</p>

          <p>Israel has formally identified the remains of two hostages, Ronen Engel and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, after their bodies were handed over by Hamas as part of a recent ceasefire agreement. Both men were believed to have been killed during the October 7, 2023 attack, with their bodies subsequently taken into Gaza. This handover is part of a U.S.-brokered peace plan that also involved Hamas releasing living hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Tensions have since emerged over the deal's implementation, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations and Israel keeping the critical Rafah border crossing closed until all hostage remains are returned.</p>

The book, co-authored by journalist Amy Wallace, details her abuse and her fight for justice against powerful figures, including Prince Andrew, whom she sued for sexual assault. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, also alleges abuse by her own father and describes the psychological torment inflicted by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

          <p>The British government has unveiled a plan to generate 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to train and recruit more workers for roles in renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear power. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that the initiative is essential for developing the UK's domestic energy capacity and lowering household bills in the long term. The strategy includes establishing five "technical excellence colleges," creating programs to match military veterans with green energy careers, and offering tailored training for various groups. The plan aims to double employment in the sector to 860,000 within five years, bringing well-paid industrial jobs to communities across the country.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after a brazen daytime robbery where several individuals dressed as construction workers stole priceless jewelry from the Apollo Gallery. The thieves reportedly broke a window to enter the gallery, which houses the French crown jewels, and used small chainsaws to crack open display cases. At least nine pieces of "inestimable heritage and historical value," including items that once belonged to Napoleon, were taken in the heist, which lasted only about seven minutes.

          <p>An opinion article praises two federal district court judges for blocking the Trump administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges ruled that the administration's justifications, which described the cities as "war-ravaged" and under siege, were "untethered to the facts" and not conceived in good faith. The article contrasts the judges' actions with what it calls the Supreme Court's deference to the president, arguing that the lower court rulings represent a courageous stand for constitutional law over martial law. It calls on the Supreme Court to apply similar scrutiny in upcoming cases involving the administration's use of executive power.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested the government is considering cutting the 5% value-added tax (VAT) on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. While not confirming the move, Miliband acknowledged the country faces a significant "cost-of-living crisis" and that officials are "looking at all of these issues" to provide relief. This comes as the government faces pressure to fulfill a campaign promise to lower average bills, with prices having recently increased under the latest regulatory price cap. The primary long-term solution, Miliband argued, remains transitioning to home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets.</p>

This announcement follows the emergence of a video showing Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. Hamas rejected the U.S. claims as "false allegations" and accused Israel of supporting rival armed gangs.

A recent study estimates that these tariffs will cost U.S. households nearly $2,400 more per year, with consumers absorbing over $900 billion in increased expenses. Many individuals describe having to shrink their budgets, forgo non-essential purchases, and visit multiple stores to find affordable options, with some pantry staples becoming scarce.

          <h2>Opinion Piece Proposes 'Fiscal Disobedience' as a Strategy for Blue States to Resist Trump</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democratic-led states should consider a form of "fiscal disobedience" to counter the Trump administration's weaponization of federal power against political opponents. The proposed strategy involves states creating escrow accounts to temporarily hold federal tax revenues collected from their residents and businesses. These funds would only be released to the federal government once certain constitutional conditions are met, such as the cessation of punitive funding cuts and unauthorized military deployments in their cities. The author suggests this legally risky but powerful maneuver could transform a one-sided assault into a constitutional struggle, giving blue states material leverage against what is described as an authoritarian regime.</p>

          <p>A new investigation has uncovered a coordinated campaign by major soft-drink and snack-food corporations to undermine public health efforts by pitting Donald Trump's MAGA base against Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement. The campaign, led by trade groups like the American Beverage Association, uses a network of Republican-tied strategists, pollsters, and media outlets to frame nutrition initiatives, such as restricting soda purchases with SNAP benefits, as an attack on the choices of working-class voters. The effort involves industry-funded polls presented as objective news and paid social media influencers who promote pro-soda talking points, aiming to create a political backlash against health-focused regulations.</p>

          <p>Autistic advocates and researchers are criticizing the Trump administration's focus on investigating unproven links between autism and substances like acetaminophen, calling it a distraction from the community's actual needs. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently stated the administration is seeking to "make the proof" of a connection, a goal unsupported by rigorous science. Advocates argue that federal funding and attention should instead be directed toward vital support services, which face cuts under the current budget, and quality-of-life research. They emphasize the need for improved access to healthcare, mental health services, and community support rather than pursuing what they describe as "useless" and eliminationist research.</p>

          <p>In war-torn regions of Ukraine, a generation of children is growing up in a subterranean world to escape the constant threat of Russian drones and missiles. With thousands of schools destroyed, communities are building reinforced concrete bunkers to serve as classrooms, allowing students to learn in person after years of isolating online instruction. This effort reflects a grim acceptance that the conflict will persist, and it addresses a growing crisis of learning loss and psychological trauma among young people. Educators and psychologists report that the prolonged isolation has left many children anxious and struggling emotionally, making the return to any form of social, educational normalcy a national priority.</p>

          <p>As pickleball's popularity soars in the United States, a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology reveals a corresponding and dramatic increase in eye injuries related to the sport. Researchers estimate that the incidence of such injuries, which include corneal abrasions and lacerations, has risen by over 400 cases annually between 2021 and 2024, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors are calling for the development of standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, noting that up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries are preventable. Experts emphasize that despite the use of a lightweight wiffle ball, the fast-paced nature of the game on a small court creates significant risk.</p>

          <p>Roman Surovtsev, who arrived in the U.S. as a refugee from the former Soviet Union at age four, was detained by ICE during a routine check-in despite previous failed attempts to deport him. Because he left before the fall of the Soviet Union, neither Ukraine nor Russia can confirm his citizenship, leaving him effectively stateless and without the travel documents needed for removal. His lawyers argue his re-detention is unconstitutional, as there is no foreseeable likelihood of his removal, especially to Ukraine where he could be drafted into conflict. His case highlights the human consequences of the administration's aggressive deportation targets and the legal challenges faced by stateless individuals in the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police are "actively" examining media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to gather personal information on his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims suggest he asked an officer to investigate her shortly before a newspaper published a photograph of them together in 2011, allegedly providing her confidential social security number. This development comes just after the prince announced he would voluntarily relinquish his royal titles amid ongoing scrutiny of his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. If true, the allegations would represent a serious misuse of police resources for personal matters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, memory functions less like a factual archive and more like a tool for constructing the story of our lives. In a recent interview, he explained that memory is not about perfect recall but about selecting and shaping experiences to understand the present and anticipate the future. Forgetting is an essential part of this process, as it allows the mind to prioritize emotionally significant events and useful information. This means our satisfaction with past events is often determined by the condensed "highlight reel" we remember, not the full experience, highlighting how the narratives we build from our memories are fundamental to our identity and happiness.</p>

          <p>Solar power technology is advancing to allow for electricity generation in a variety of unconventional spaces beyond traditional rooftop panels. Innovations include installing solar modules over parking lots, along roadside noise barriers, and even integrated directly into railway tracks, with a Swiss project aiming to power trains with track-laid panels. Other developments feature solar cells embedded in building facades that are nearly invisible, and agrivoltaics, where panels are mounted on stilts above farmland, providing both electricity and shade for crops. These creative applications significantly expand the potential for clean energy production by utilizing existing infrastructure and land without displacing other essential activities.</p>

          <p>Labor unions have become a primary force of opposition to the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce and curtail workers' rights, filing dozens of lawsuits nationwide. These legal battles target actions such as rescinding collective bargaining rights for over a million employees, implementing mass layoffs, and attempting to dismantle entire federal agencies. Unions recently achieved a notable victory with a temporary restraining order blocking layoffs related to the government shutdown. Legal experts and union leaders describe the administration's actions as an unprecedented, politically motivated assault on the nonpartisan civil service, arguing that their fight is essential to protecting both workers' rights and democratic institutions.</p>

As a result, Mahan's income has fallen by an estimated $2,000 a month, forcing him to deplete his savings and cut back on expenses.
