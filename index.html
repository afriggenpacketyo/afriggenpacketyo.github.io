          <p>President Trump has expressed strong disapproval of Vladimir Putin's intensified attacks on Ukraine, labeling them "absolutely crazy" and suggesting that Putin has changed. This criticism comes amidst a significant increase in Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, causing numerous casualties and thwarting hopes of a near-term peace agreement. Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's public statements, reflecting a complex and evolving stance on the conflict. Despite the condemnation, the Russian government downplayed Trump's remarks as an emotional outburst, while some European leaders saw a glimmer of hope that Trump might take more decisive action against Moscow.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential shift towards a foreign policy where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. This vision includes efforts to normalize commerce with Russia, attempts to exert greater American influence in the Western Hemisphere, and criticisms of allies that could benefit Russia and China. Some analysts caution against attributing a strategic vision to Trump's actions, while others see signs of an imperial mindset. However, efforts to expand American influence have faced resistance, indicating the challenges of establishing spheres of influence in the modern era.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices by early June. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is targeting a price level of around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by selling rice produced in 2021 and 2022 to major retailers. This move is a response to public criticism of the government's failure to control rising rice prices amid broader inflation. The plan bypasses the auction system, allowing the government to directly influence prices and address public concerns about affordability, as the public appear receptive to Koizumi's plans.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes killed at least 52 people in the Gaza Strip on Monday, including some 36 in a school-turned-shelter that was struck as people slept, igniting their belongings, according to local health officials. The military said it targeted militants operating from the school. Israel renewed its offensive in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas. It has vowed to seize control of Gaza and keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed or disarmed, and until it returns the remaining 58 hostages, a third of them believed to be alive, from the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Cindy McCain says aid trucks to Gaza are a "drop in the bucket as to what's needed"</p>

          <h2>Head of New Gaza Aid System Resigns Over Lack of Autonomy</h2>

          <p>Jake Wood quit the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, saying it was “not possible” to implement a new Israeli-backed aid system in the enclave while remaining neutral and independent.  Mr. Wood, a former U.S. Marine, was hired in early 2025 to run the project. As a co-founder of Team Rubicon, an aid organization, he had overseen humanitarian operations in scores of crisis zones over the past decade, including in Haiti, Myanmar and Sudan.  At the time of his appointment, he said in his resignation statement, the foundation was “a loose constellation of various ideas and concepts among a wide range of stakeholders and I sought to establish it as a truly independent humanitarian entity.” </p>
