          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure to Meta, confirming earlier reports tied to a substantial $14.3 billion investment from the social networking giant. Meta will acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI without voting power, while Wang will contribute to Meta's superintelligence initiatives. Jason Droege, the chief strategy officer, will take over as CEO of Scale AI, and a small group of Scale AI employees will also transition to Meta as part of the agreement. Despite Meta's investment and Wang's move, Scale AI assures its customers, including rivals like Google and Microsoft, that their business information and data will remain confidential, as Zuckerberg aims to bolster his company's AI efforts amid competition. The move comes as Zuckerberg expresses frustration with his team's AI development progress and believes Wang is better suited to oversee crucial AI initiatives for the company.</p>

          <p>Iranian state television reported that Iran has suspended its participation in the sixth round of nuclear negotiations with the United States, originally scheduled for this weekend in Muscat, Oman, following continued Israeli airstrikes. Reports indicate that explosions were heard near Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, prompting the activation of air defense systems in central Tehran and airstrikes in Isfahan. An Israeli Defense Forces colonel confirmed that the IDF conducted strikes against the nuclear plant in Isfahan, as well as operations in Natanz. Amid these developments, former President Donald Trump urged Tehran to reach a nuclear deal "before there is nothing left," warning of the lethal military equipment possessed by the United States and Israel.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is planning a visit to the Iowa State Fairgrounds this summer, potentially in July, to shore up support in farm country and celebrate the nation's 250th anniversary. Trump last visited the fair in August 2023, attracting a record crowd despite facing legal challenges at the time, and he won the Iowa caucuses in January 2024 by a significant margin. He has expressed interest in hosting a year-long exhibition at the fairgrounds in 2026 to commemorate the nation's semiquincentennial, as the Iowa State Fair is a significant summer event showcasing agriculture and middle America. Iowa has been attracting politicians from both parties, although the Democratic National Committee stripped Iowa of its "first in the nation" status for the party's nominating process in 2023.</p>

          <p>R. Kelly's attorney has filed an emergency motion alleging a murder plot orchestrated by prison officials and inmates, requesting temporary home confinement for the singer. The motion claims that three prison officials conspired to have Kelly killed by an Aryan Brotherhood member, Mikeal Glenn Stine, who alleges he was directed to target Kelly due to the singer's lawyers potentially exposing damaging information about the Bureau of Prisons. Stine claims he was offered a deal to execute Kelly and then be allowed to escape, but he instead informed Kelly of the plot. Kelly's attorney argues that his client's life is in danger, constituting cruel and unusual punishment, and accuses the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office of conspiring to use attorney-client privileged information against Kelly.</p>

          <p>The FDA has expanded its approval of Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 at increased risk of the disease, previously only approved for those 60 and older. This approval follows a late-stage clinical trial showing the vaccine boosted immune responses in younger adults, with over one-third of adults between 18 and 59 having underlying conditions that increase RSV risk. While the FDA has approved the expansion, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee must vote to recommend the new age group's eligibility, followed by a final recommendation from the CDC director. The CDC currently recommends RSV vaccination only for those 75 and older and for those 60 and over at increased risk, and recent changes to the CDC's advisory committee may influence future recommendations.</p>

          <p>Kim Gordon, co-founder of Sonic Youth, has released a new version of her song "Bye Bye" called "Bye Bye 25," featuring terms the Trump administration has attempted to minimize from public life. Gordon drew inspiration from a list of phrases scrubbed from government websites and materials, reflecting Trump's stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as policy issues. The song highlights the absurdity of controlling policy through language, avoiding direct sloganeering and presenting a jumble of terms for reflection. Gordon's effort is one of the few instances of established musicians directly responding to Trump's second term, as she aims to describe the current state through her music and lyrics.</p>

          <p>MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell will not face any further action after being questioned by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in London. The pair were interviewed after participating in a demonstration in January, where it was alleged they failed to follow police restrictions. McDonnell stated that they had followed police instructions at all times, while Corbyn accused the Metropolitan Police of targeting them as members of Parliament. The Met had referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service, citing that as MPs, they should be held to a "greater culpability," a practice that McDonnell criticized as undermining equality before the law.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee, a week after being brought back to the U.S. from detention in El Salvador. He is accused of transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. as part of a conspiracy, involving the domestic transport of individuals from Mexico and Central America, including children, in exchange for money. The judge began hearing arguments over whether to hold a pre-trial detention hearing to determine if Abrego Garcia should remain in custody pending trial. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue that the government's arguments for detention are without merit, claiming he is not a flight risk and poses no serious risk of obstructing justice.</p>

James 'Jimmy' Sheen pleaded guilty to burglary and related charges, while Michael Jones was found guilty of burglary, with Sheen sentenced to four years and Jones to two years and three months. The heist, described as "bold and brazen," took only minutes, and Sheen was identified through DNA evidence and incriminating messages on his phone. The stolen gold was sold for Â£520,000, and Sheen, already serving a 19-year sentence, will serve the additional four years consecutively, while Jones's role involved reconnaissance of the museum.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has lost his bid for an appeals court to rehear the E. Jean Carroll case, where he was found liable for sexual assault and defamation. The denial comes after a three-judge panel upheld a 2023 verdict ordering Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages, with two judges dissenting from the decision not to grant an en banc rehearing. Trump's legal team suggests they will appeal to the Supreme Court, while Carroll's attorney stated that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. This is one of two defamation-related verdicts Carroll obtained against Trump, both relating to statements denying her claim of sexual assault in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded in early June, surpassing expectations as concerns about the economy and inflation eased amid progress in the global trade war, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, with significant increases in both current conditions and future expectations, coinciding with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs. While sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, the one-year inflation outlook tumbled, reflecting a decrease in consumer fears about the impact of tariffs, as the Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady.</p>

While Germany supports Israel's right to defend itself, criticism of Israeli actions has grown within the German government, and experts suggest that direct negotiations between the US and Iran are crucial.
