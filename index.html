          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot at a Utah campus event, prompting a manhunt for the shooter and widespread condemnation across the political spectrum. The FBI is assisting local authorities in the investigation, seeking tips and digital media from the public. Kirk, known for his youth outreach through Turning Point USA, was a controversial figure. The incident has sparked debate about political violence in the US, with some blaming the "radical left" while others point to rising political polarization. Tributes poured in from figures like Donald Trump and other prominent politicians, reflecting Kirk's influence in conservative circles. The score is 10.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield initially fell to 4% before rebounding as investors analyzed the latest inflation data and a jump in jobless claims. August's consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4%, with the annual inflation rate at 2.9%, while weekly jobless claims increased to 263,000. These mixed economic signals have complicated the interest rate outlook for the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting. Markets are pricing in a high probability of a quarter-point rate cut, influenced by the weaker-than-expected producer price index from the previous day. The score is 55. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey indicates that family offices are increasing their investments in stocks while reducing their allocations to private equity.

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry expressed his belief that L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer did not attempt to circumvent the NBA's salary cap. The allegations stem from a $28 million sponsorship deal between Kawhi Leonard and a company in which Ballmer invested. Lasry stated that he has always found Ballmer to be honorable and that he doesn't believe there was pressure to skirt the rules. Ballmer and the Clippers have denied the allegations, and the NBA has begun an investigation based on the reporting. The score is 70.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's economic agenda, describing it as a mix of Reaganite policies, state capitalism, and erratic interventions. It argues that Trumponomics is more about Trump's desire to control everything around him than a coherent economic strategy. The formula includes declaring emergencies to justify intervention, making threats to force private actors to do his bidding, and demanding tribute. The article suggests that Trump's personalist style of politics thrusts America back to the Gilded Age, marked by corruption and personal gain. The score is 40.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the decline of teen babysitting and its impact on both teens and the community. Babysitting offers teens valuable skills like responsibility and critical thinking, while also providing younger children with a unique connection to someone closer to their age. The shift from teen to adult babysitters is attributed to safety concerns, busier teen schedules, and higher expectations from parents. Resurrecting the culture of teen babysitting could strengthen community ties and provide teens with valuable independence challenges. The score is 70.</p>
