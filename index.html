          <p>Paraguay's President Santiago Peña has pledged to defend the nation's 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, describing it as a strategic alliance rooted in shared democratic values. Speaking at a business forum, Peña emphasized that the ties are a matter of sovereign foreign policy, not merely economic interest. This statement reinforces Paraguay's position as one of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies, coming after Paraguayan authorities previously accused a Chinese envoy of attempting to persuade opposition lawmakers to switch recognition to Beijing.</p>

          <p>A Jefferies report indicates that China is becoming a "biotech supermarket" due to its cost and efficiency advantages in drug development. At a recent major cancer research conference, nearly one-third of drug candidate presentations involved Chinese companies, a significant increase from just one a decade ago. Global pharmaceutical multinationals are increasingly seeking partnerships with Chinese firms to access novel drugs. These deals typically grant the international partners rights to develop and market the drugs globally, while the Chinese innovators retain rights in their domestic market.</p>

          <p>Rumors about legendary coach Nick Saban returning to football intensified during SEC Media Days, fueled by comments from prominent figures in the sport.

While exports showed some momentum, factors like falling prices and low consumer confidence are expected to soften growth in the second half of the year.

After believing he could broker a quick peace deal, Trump has grown angry that Putin has ignored his efforts and escalated the conflict, making him appear weak.

          <p>Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, has announced he will run for mayor of New York City as an independent candidate. The decision follows his loss in the Democratic primary to progressive state assembly member Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo's entry into the race creates a crowded field that also includes the incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Some analysts suggest the presence of multiple independent and moderate candidates could split the vote and clear a path for Mamdani to win.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is rolling out generative AI tools to 30,000 city government workers, making it one of the largest local governments to adopt such technology. The city will use Microsoft 365 Copilot, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, to assist employees with administrative tasks like data analysis and report drafting. The move follows a successful six-month pilot program that showed productivity gains of up to five hours per week for workers. Mayor Daniel Lurie stated the goal is to improve city services and response times at no additional cost.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could eventually be transferred to the postmasters who run its branches. This idea of "mutualisation" has been discussed for over a decade but was sidelined by the Horizon IT scandal. The government aims to transform the organization's culture and restore trust following the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. Any change in ownership structure is unlikely before 2030, but the consultation will also explore the future services the Post Office should offer.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with plans to fire more than half of the Department of Education's employees while a legal challenge is ongoing. The decision, issued from the Court's "shadow docket," did not include a written explanation from the majority. A dissent from the Court's three liberal justices argued that the mass firings would effectively cancel federal programs mandated by Congress. The ruling raises concerns that the administration could be allowed to dismantle federal agencies by eliminating their workforce.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the Autopilot system in a 2019 Model S was defective and failed to detect a parked vehicle, causing the crash. The driver of the Tesla, who admits he was distracted by a dropped cell phone, had the Autopilot function activated. Tesla argues that the system is not fully self-driving and that the driver remains responsible, attributing the crash to driver distraction and not a technological failure.</p>
