            <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that Powell is too slow in cutting interest rates and adding that his term "cannot come fast enough." Trump's remarks followed Powell's warning about the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war. Powell highlighted the risk of "stagflation" due to tariffs. Trump has a history of challenging the Fed's independence, but legal precedent suggests he cannot easily remove Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student from Turkey, was denied bond by an immigration judge after being detained last month. Her lawyers allege her detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights.

However, there are concerns about the concentration of power, the lack of judicial independence, and the potential for religious restrictions. The international community is closely watching the situation as Syria navigates its path forward.</p>
