          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and used the opportunity to emphasize the importance of the Constitution as a unifying force. Pence highlighted his adherence to constitutional principles during the 2020 election aftermath, despite pressure from President Trump to overturn the results. He underscored the Constitution as the common ground that binds Americans, irrespective of their differences, and referenced disagreements with both Democrats and his own Republican Party on issues like spending, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Pence's actions on January 6, 2021, were recognized as upholding the peaceful transfer of power, earning him the award.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has initiated the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists in preparation for an expanded military operation in Gaza, with the stated goals of securing the release of hostages and defeating Hamas militants. This decision follows the breakdown of a previous ceasefire and has drawn criticism regarding its effectiveness in achieving hostage release and the broader objectives of Prime Minister Netanyahu. The planned offensive aims to operate in new areas and dismantle infrastructure both above and below ground, however reports suggest that it will not happen until after President Donald Trump's trip to the region next week. The move also raises concerns about the strain on reservists and the safety of hostages.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has shut down its in-house beagle laboratory after reports surfaced detailing alleged inhumane treatment of thousands of beagles over four decades. Allegations included injecting pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and subjecting them to deadly experiments. The decision follows scrutiny from animal rights groups and investigations into the lab's practices, and comes after DOGE head Elon Musk posted on X that he would investigate funding beagle experiments. Animal rights organizations praised the closure as a step towards modernizing science and ending wasteful spending on animal abuse. PETA highlighted Anthony Fauci's alleged approval of funding for tests in Tunisia where beagle puppies were drugged, and their heads were locked in cages filled with hungry, infected sandflies.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed judicial nominations, stating his administration is rapidly appointing judges who will not demand trials for every illegal immigrant. He emphasized the need for judges who support the administration's sweeping deportation policies, citing the millions of people who have entered the country illegally. Trump described his overhaul of U.S. immigration policies as his top campaign issue, claiming that 'radicalized' judges are delaying the process. He argued that the country cannot afford lengthy trials for every criminal among the millions of illegal immigrants, suggesting the Supreme Court would not allow such delays.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, citing concerns over the decline of the American film industry. Trump attributed this decline to incentives offered by other countries to attract filmmakers and studios, which he considers a national security threat due to messaging and propaganda. He emphasized his desire to bring movie production back to America, appointing Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone as special ambassadors to promote Hollywood. The move has sparked concerns about potential impacts on the global economy and retaliatory measures from other countries.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3, ending their seven-game winning streak. May gave up two two-run home runs to Austin Riley on poorly executed sweepers, accounting for all four of the Braves' runs. Despite pitching effectively outside of those two pitches, May's inability to consistently land his sweeper has been a recurring issue in recent outings. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, failing to provide sufficient run support for May, who has yielded 14 runs in his last three starts.</p>

Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, was once home to notorious criminals like Al Capone and George 'Machine Gun' Kelly.

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to reopen Alcatraz prison to house America's most violent and ruthless offenders. Trump said the decision is motivated by the need to address the issue of repeat criminal offenders and that reopening the prison would symbolize law, order, and justice. The infamous prison, located on an island in San Francisco Bay, was known for its inescapable nature and housed notorious criminals like Al Capone. The closure of Alcatraz in 1963 was attributed to high operating costs and infrastructure issues.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) headquarters honoring victims of gun violence has been taken down, confirmed by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The exhibit, titled 'Faces of Gun Violence,' featured portraits of 120 people killed by gun violence, including victims of mass shootings, domestic violence, and law enforcement officers. A DOJ spokesperson stated that the ATF will continue to honor victims of violent crime while preserving the rights of law-abiding Americans, but the exhibit removal has been criticized as a political move to downplay the reality of gun violence. The DOJ did not answer a question from NPR asking where the portraits are now located.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for rejecting his offer to send U.S. troops into Mexico to combat drug cartels, attributing her refusal to fear of the cartels. Trump stated that the U.S. military is needed to address the fentanyl crisis in the United States and expressed his willingness to provide assistance if Mexico desired it. Sheinbaum affirmed her commitment to sovereignty, stating that U.S. troops operating inside Mexico would be unacceptable. The U.S. military presence along the southern border with Mexico has increased steadily in recent months, following Trumpâ€™s order in January to increase the armyâ€™s role in stemming the flow of migrants.</p>

          <p>A recent trend shows voters punishing candidates seen as friendly to President Trump, but Trump's influence on global politics is complex. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties won elections by campaigning against Trump-like policies, while in Germany, Trump's actions have indirectly helped the new chancellor. However, in Britain, a Trump ally is gaining ground, and the Labour Party has suffered losses. The article also highlights the impact of Trump's policies on international trade and alliances, suggesting that his presence is a significant factor in voters' decisions worldwide.</p>

          <p>The year 2024 marked the deadliest for Russian forces in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, with at least 45,287 soldiers killed, a figure almost three times higher than in the first year of the invasion. This translates to approximately 27 Russian lives lost for every kilometer of Ukrainian territory captured. The analysis, conducted by the BBC Russian Service and Mediazona, used open-source data to identify the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the conflict, although military experts estimate the actual number could be significantly higher. The report also highlights the challenges Russia faces in replenishing its forces, with recruitment efforts intensifying and combat salaries for volunteer soldiers significantly higher than average wages in many regions.</p>
