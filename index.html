          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has revealed that Pentagon officials are actively discussing the possibility of the U.S. government taking equity stakes in major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin. This consideration follows the government's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, a move President Trump has indicated he would repeat. The discussions suggest a potential major overhaul of how the U.S. finances its defense capabilities, with Lutnick describing the current system as a "giveaway." This approach has drawn criticism from some conservatives who argue it undermines free market principles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The announcement of singer Taylor Swift's engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce triggered a brief but notable spike in the stock price of Signet Jewelers. The social media post, which featured a "cushion cut" diamond ring, quickly garnered millions of likes, presumably driving investor speculation about a potential increase in ring sales. This event underscores Swift's significant economic influence, previously observed during her "Eras" tour, which was credited by the Federal Reserve for boosting local economies. The market reaction highlights the powerful intersection of celebrity culture and consumer finance.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Quaest reveals a significant shift in Brazilian public opinion regarding global superpowers, with negative views of the United States doubling since early 2024. The poll found that 48% of Brazilians now hold an unfavorable opinion of the U.S., while positive perceptions of China have risen sharply to 49%. According to the polling firm's director, these shifting views are strongly correlated with domestic political ideologies. Left-leaning voters tend to view China more positively, whereas right-leaning voters remain the primary supporters of the U.S. within the country.</p>

          <p>President Trump has faced significant criticism from his own "Make America Great Again" supporters after signaling a policy reversal to allow 600,000 Chinese students into the United States. This move, described as important for ongoing trade talks, marks a sharp departure from his administration's previous stance of aggressively revoking visas for Chinese students. Prominent allies, such as Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, have publicly questioned the decision, expressing concerns about potential loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and the displacement of American students. The controversy highlights a growing rift within Trump's base over his evolving China policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the federal government will now seek capital punishment for any murders committed within Washington, D.C., a jurisdiction that abolished its own death penalty in 1981. The directive is part of a broader federal crackdown on crime, which the president is framing as a strong preventative measure. This policy move challenges the district's local laws, as D.C. has not carried out an execution since 1957. The announcement came during a cabinet meeting where Trump emphasized the policy as a key component of his administration's law-and-order initiatives.</p>

The painting belonged to the extensive collection of Jacques Goudstikker, and its discovery was the result of an investigation by a Dutch newspaper.

The firing is a significant escalation of Trump's public criticism of the central bank and its monetary policy.

This ruling could potentially create a more competitive district, possibly opening a path for a Democrat to win a U.S. House seat in the heavily Republican state.

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has encountered significant public criticism and a nearly $100 million drop in market value after unveiling a new, modernized logo. The redesign removed the iconic image of "Uncle Herschel," a figure central to the brand's folksy, "homestyle country cooking" identity. Marketing experts have called the move a "flop," arguing that the company abandoned its unique brand story for a generic design that alienated its loyal customer base. In response to the backlash, Cracker Barrel has stated that Uncle Herschel will remain a key part of its menus and in-store branding.</p>

          <p>The Katherine Johnson Technology Magnet Academy in DeSoto, Texas, is dedicating a week to teaching its students about the life and legacy of its pioneering namesake. Johnson was a brilliant mathematician whose critical calculations for NASA were instrumental in the success of America's early spaceflights, a story famously told in the film "Hidden Figures." The school aims to instill in its 600 students the values of hard work and self-confidence that defined Johnson's journey as a Black woman overcoming racial segregation. The lessons are designed to inspire students to understand the profound impact they too can have on the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which is representing the city of Los Angeles in a major homelessness lawsuit, is requesting a $5 million increase to its contract, bringing the total to $5.9 million. The firm was hired to defend the city against claims that it has violated a settlement agreement regarding homeless housing and encampment removals. The request comes after the firm billed the city $3.2 million for work performed through early August, with some attorneys charging over $1,200 per hour. The high legal costs have drawn criticism, with some officials arguing the money would be better spent directly on housing services.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Conflict with the Federal Reserve Raises Concerns Over Central Bank Independence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 12:53:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The escalating conflict between President Trump and the Federal Reserve, highlighted by his move to fire Governor Lisa Cook, is raising significant questions about the central bank's political independence. For decades, the Fed has operated autonomously to set monetary policy, a separation designed to prevent short-term political goals from causing long-term economic instability like uncontrolled inflation. Trump's repeated attacks and attempts to install politically aligned figures on the Fed's board challenge this precedent. Economists warn that eroding the Fed's credibility could rattle global markets and increase borrowing costs for the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Dobson, a child psychologist who became one of America's most powerful and uncompromising leaders of the religious right, has died at the age of 89. Through his organization Focus on the Family, his daily broadcasts reached millions, whom he mobilized into a potent political force advocating for conservative Republican candidates and policies. He was a staunch opponent of feminism, abortion, and gay rights, framing his activism as a "civil war of values." His influential books, such as "Dare to Discipline," promoted corporal punishment for children and traditional gender roles within the family.</p>
