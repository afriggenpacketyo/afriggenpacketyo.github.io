          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the individual suspected of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk has been taken into custody. In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that someone close to the suspect turned them in to the authorities. The president expressed his hope that the perpetrator would receive the death penalty. This announcement came shortly before law enforcement was scheduled to hold a press conference regarding the manhunt, with the FBI having previously released images of a person of interest.</p>

          <p>Millions of Facebook users who filed claims in a $725 million privacy settlement are set to receive payments over the next several weeks. The class-action lawsuit stemmed from allegations that Facebook improperly shared user data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. Approved claimants will receive an email notification before their payment is issued, with the average amount being approximately $29. The final payout for each individual is calculated based on the duration of their Facebook account activity between May 2007 and December 2022.</p>

          <p>England's rugby captain, Zoe Aldcroft, is set to return from a knee injury to start in the Women's World Cup quarter-final match against Scotland. Aldcroft has been sidelined since the tournament's opening game but has been named to the starting lineup as blind-side flanker. Her return is a significant boost for the team as they enter the knockout stages of the competition. England is heavily favored to win, having not lost to Scotland since 1999, and a victory would extend their record-breaking international winning streak.</p>

          <p>A sheriff in Scotland has ordered the eviction of a group calling itself the 'Kingdom of Kubala' from a privately owned woodland near Jedburgh. The group, consisting of three individuals, had been camping on the land for weeks, claiming it was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago. After they ignored a previous instruction to leave, the landowner successfully sought a court order for their removal.

An alternative plan suggests a tiered increase, raising the retirement age only for the top 40 percent of earners while leaving it unchanged for the majority. This approach aims to ensure the program's solvency without placing a heavier burden on more vulnerable retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As demand for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) soars, financial experts are cautioning investors against several common pitfalls. A primary mistake is failing to understand the underlying assets of an ETF, which can lead to unintended risks if a fund is more narrowly focused than perceived. Another issue is 'chasing performance' by investing in trendy or recently successful ETFs without considering long-term goals and risk tolerance. Experts also warn against excessive trading, which can erode the low-cost and tax-efficient benefits that make ETFs attractive for long-term investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Israel's recent airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha demonstrates that U.S. security promises to allies like Qatar are unreliable, especially concerning Israeli actions. The author notes that despite Qatar's significant investments in its relationship with the U.S., including hosting a major military base, the attack proceeded without consequence. The strike is framed as an attempt by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sabotage ceasefire negotiations. This act of aggression on an allied nation's soil ultimately exposes the limits of American influence and protection when confronted with Israel's security objectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread use of student teacher evaluations in American universities is linked to grade inflation and a decline in academic rigor. Research indicates that students often give higher ratings to professors who assign less work and award better grades, creating an incentive for faculty to lower their standards. These evaluation scores can significantly impact professors' careers, including decisions on pay, hiring, and tenure, especially for adjuncts and junior faculty. This dynamic creates a feedback loop where instructors feel pressured to inflate student grades to receive positive evaluations, ultimately compromising educational quality.</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are voicing frustration over the government's handling of Peter Mandelson's appointment and subsequent dismissal as UK ambassador to the U.S. Mandelson was fired after new information emerged about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Prime Minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, is facing increasing blame for the initial appointment and the delay in removing Mandelson. The episode has been described as a 'shambles' by some MPs, compounding a difficult period for the government and eroding trust.</p>

          <p>Following Beijing's announcement of plans to establish a national nature reserve at the Scarborough Shoal, experts anticipate that China will increase its routine patrols in the contested area. This could involve daily deployments of coast guard vessels, aircraft, drones, and uncrewed boats. The move has been strongly condemned by the Philippines, which also claims the territory. Chinese researchers may also begin on-site environmental surveys to create a database for monitoring the shoal's ecosystem, further cementing China's presence in the disputed part of the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Recent online harassment directed at public figures like Princess Kate, singer Nelly Furtado, and politician Annalena Baerbock highlights a persistent trend of sexist trolling. Media experts note that women in the public eye are disproportionately subjected to aggressive criticism focused on their physical appearance, a phenomenon amplified by social media algorithms. This constant scrutiny reinforces unrealistic beauty standards and serves as a method of exerting power and control. The article points out that this behavior is rooted in historical power structures that have long judged women based on appearance rather than competence.</p>

The facility is intended for short-term stays but data shows it frequently holds individuals for much longer.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, while morally repugnant, is being used by prominent conservatives to call for a dangerous expansion of federal government repression. The author notes that figures on the right are framing the attack as part of a war waged by 'the left,' demanding that the government infiltrate, disrupt, and incarcerate their political opponents. This rhetoric, the article warns, conflates all left-leaning opposition with political violence. It risks justifying a broad crackdown that would undermine free speech and democratic principles for everyone.</p>

While major men's leagues attract the most attention, some high-profile investors are also acquiring stakes in women's leagues like the WNBA.

          <p>An analysis suggests that Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado may be supportive of the Trump administration's recent naval deployment to the Caribbean for anti-drug operations. Months before the mission, Machado had expressed a desire for a 'big antinarcotics operation' targeting Nicolás Maduro's regime, which she frames as a criminal enterprise. The administration has since echoed her rhetoric, labeling the Maduro government a 'narco-terror cartel.' While this strategy may be a gamble to pressure the regime, it raises concerns about inviting U.S. military intervention in the region.</p>

The debate featured passionate arguments from both sides, with one peer recounting how his father's painful death from cancer changed his mind on the issue.

This decision pauses a lower court's ruling that had required the government to continue reimbursements. The policy in question, part of a tax bill, aims to defund abortion providers for one year, affecting access to a range of non-abortion health services for millions of low-income patients who rely on Medicaid. Planned Parenthood has stated the ruling puts hundreds of its health centers at risk of closure.</p>
