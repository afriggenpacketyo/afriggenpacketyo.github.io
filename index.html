          <p>New York City socialist political candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing scrutiny after delivering a sermon at a Queens church led by a controversial pastor. The pastor, Rev. Stephen A. Green, has a history of advocating for radical positions such as abolishing the police, implementing reparations, and has made anti-Israel statements. Mamdani, who has previously called to defund the police, referred to the pastor as his "brother and friend," raising concerns among critics about his political judgment and alignment with extremist views as he campaigns on a platform addressing affordability in the city.</p>

          <p>Japan has recorded its highest temperatures ever, with the city of Isesaki reaching 41.8°C (107.24°F), breaking a national record set just a week prior. This extreme heat is part of a broader trend affecting the country and the world, attributed to climate change, which has also led to the earliest cherry blossoms and a delayed snowcap on Mount Fuji. The heatwave is causing practical problems, including water shortages for farmers and increased health risks for the elderly population, prompting widespread warnings from officials for citizens to take precautions against heatstroke.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered the extensive operations of a violent Iraqi-Kurdish gang smuggling people across the English Channel from France to the UK. Posing as a migrant, a reporter gained access to the gang's French hideout and filmed associates collecting cash payments in Birmingham, UK. The investigation identified key leaders and detailed the group's methods, including frequent name changes to evade authorities and subjecting migrants to severe violence. This report highlights the challenges authorities face in dismantling these lucrative and dangerous criminal enterprises, which continue despite deadly incidents.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has announced it will restore and reinstall a bronze statue of Confederate General Albert Pike in Washington, D.C., which was torn down by protesters in 2020. The agency stated the restoration aligns with federal historic preservation laws and executive orders to beautify the capital and reinstate statues. The decision has drawn condemnation from D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who described Pike as a "racist and a traitor" and argued the statue has no place on public land. The monument, originally dedicated in 1901 to honor Pike's leadership in Freemasonry, is expected to be reinstalled by October.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and DNC Chair Ken Martin have publicly joined Texas Democrats who fled their state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. The plan aims to create five new congressional districts favoring Republicans, which Democrats argue is a "corrupt" attempt to disenfranchise Black and Latino voters. By leaving Texas, the Democratic lawmakers have denied the state legislature the quorum needed to pass the bill. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested, escalating a partisan battle over voting rights and political power.</p>

          <p>In a development in Donald Trump's libel lawsuit against News Corp, Rupert Murdoch has agreed to provide sworn declarations about his health to postpone his deposition. Trump sued Murdoch over a Wall Street Journal story about Jeffrey Epstein, initially demanding the 94-year-old mogul testify promptly due to his age and health concerns. According to a court filing, Murdoch will now provide regular health updates, and his deposition will be deferred until after a ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss the case. The lawsuit stems from an article alleging Trump sent a risqué birthday card to Epstein.</p>

          <p>New research from the think tank Third Way reveals a growing economic divide among women in the American workforce based on education. Over the past two decades, the labor force participation rate for college-educated women surged by nine percentage points, while the rate for women without a degree increased by less than one point. The study attributes this divergence to factors like access to flexible work arrangements and better caregiving benefits, which are more common in white-collar jobs. This trend suggests that economic progress for women is not being shared equally, leaving noncollege-educated women, particularly mothers, behind.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has imposed a provisional fine of nearly £46 million on former fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm, Woodford Investment Management (WIM). The penalty relates to the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund, which locked in and caused losses for approximately 300,000 investors. The FCA found that WIM and Woodford made inappropriate investment decisions that increased the fund's holdings in illiquid assets, making it impossible to meet redemption requests. WIM has stated its intent to appeal the decision, arguing the true cause of investor losses was the subsequent liquidation of the fund.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The disappointing results were driven by declining same-store sales in the United States for both KFC and Pizza Hut, which fell by 5% each. Executives cited increased competition and an insufficient value message as key challenges for the struggling brands. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, with same-store sales growing by 4%, although this was still slightly below analysts' projections. The company is implementing leadership changes at KFC to address its ongoing domestic issues.</p>

          <p>A new book by Scott Anderson, "King of Kings," examines the 1979 Iranian Revolution, arguing that its outcome was not a historical inevitability but the result of specific miscalculations and circumstances. The book focuses on the hubris of the Shah, the strategic ignorance and inaction of the U.S. government, and the ability of Ayatollah Khomeini's camp to outmaneuver them. Anderson posits that a combination of factors, including the Shah's illness and the Carter administration's distraction with other global crises, created a power vacuum that the revolutionaries exploited. The analysis suggests the Islamic Republic's rise was more accidental than predestined.</p>

          <p>Students across Scotland have received their exam results, showing a slight increase in pass rates for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications compared to last year. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a narrowing of the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. Over 147,000 candidates received their marks, with a record number of young Scots being offered university or college placements. While some mail deliveries to island communities were delayed by a storm, education officials hailed the results as a positive sign of recovery from pandemic-era disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Israeli media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to propose a full military reoccupation of the Gaza Strip to his security cabinet. An unnamed senior official stated that the decision has been made to pursue the "full conquest" of Gaza to defeat Hamas, even if it means clashing with military leaders who oppose the plan. This potential move has alarmed the families of Israeli hostages, who fear for their loved ones' safety, and would likely draw condemnation from international allies pushing for a ceasefire. The proposal follows the breakdown of negotiations and the release of distressing videos of hostages by armed groups.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer being considered for Federal Reserve chair, as Bessent wishes to remain in his current role. Trump announced he would soon name his pick for an open seat on the Fed's board, suggesting that this appointee could also be his nominee for chair when Jerome Powell's term ends. The president mentioned former economic adviser Kevin Hassett and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as strong possibilities. This comes as Trump continues to criticize the Fed for not cutting interest rates more aggressively amid signs of a slowing economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean Combs' request for release on bail as he awaits his October sentencing hearing. The hip-hop mogul was convicted last month on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In his ruling, Judge Arun Subramanian stated that Combs poses a danger to the community, citing evidence of physical assault presented during the trial, and also presents a flight risk. Combs' defense had argued for his release on a $50 million bond, contending that there was no legal precedent for his detention based solely on the prostitution convictions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023 was preventable and resulted from OceanGate's use of "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight. The 300-page report found that the company operated outside established deep-sea protocols and had a "toxic" safety culture where employee concerns were dismissed. Investigators cited a flawed design and testing process and noted that the vessel's hull had been previously damaged, compromising its integrity. The report largely blames OceanGate co-founder Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, for ignoring warnings and creating an environment where safety was underemphasized.</p>

Police did not confirm their status, citing national guidelines, which prompted criticism from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt remains at historically high levels, financial experts are advising consumers on how to qualify for debt settlement, also known as credit card debt forgiveness.
