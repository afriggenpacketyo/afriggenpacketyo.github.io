          <p>President Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, responding to Newsom's lawsuit against Trump's deployment of the National Guard to address protests. Newsom accused Trump of illegally federalizing the National Guard and acting authoritatively, while Trump defended his border czar's threat to arrest Newsom and others obstructing immigration actions. Newsom responded that Trump's call for his arrest marked an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism, and federal prosecutors have charged a labor leader with felony conspiracy for impeding an officer during a protest in L.A. This conflict highlights the escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, which stemmed from Lively's claims of sexual harassment on the set of 'It Ends With Us' and subsequent retaliation. Lively had filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios in December 2024, alleging sexual harassment and retaliation, detailing the allegations in a New York Times article. Baldoni's suit claimed Lively aimed to ruin his career by falsely alleging sexual assault and orchestrating a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni had not adequately proven that Lively's actions constituted wrongful extortion or defamation, but Baldoni is allowed to amend and refile allegations related to interference with contracts by June 23. </p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl who was groomed and charged with terrorism offences before taking her own life, concluded that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The coroner found a "systems failure" by counter-terror police and Derbyshire County Council, failing to refer Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd, the youngest girl charged with terrorism offences in the UK, was exploited online by an American neo-Nazi and influenced by a former partner of her mother, leading to her fixation on Adolf Hitler. Despite the findings, no organization was blamed for her death, but the inquest highlighted missed opportunities for mental health support and raised concerns about safeguarding vulnerable children. </p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress and the White House are urging lawmakers to swiftly pass President Trump's legislative agenda, citing the ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles as a reason to secure additional border security resources. House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized that the legislation provides essential funding to secure the nation's borders, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the protests demonstrate the need for more immigration enforcement personnel. The bill includes funding for the border wall, Border Patrol agents, and increased fees for asylum seekers, and it is now in the Senate after passing the House. The urgency to pass the bill comes as Trump called for the National Guard to enforce order in Los Angeles, leading to a clash with California Governor Gavin Newsom. </p>

          <p>An Italian referendum aimed at expediting citizenship for certain immigrants and bolstering labor rights failed due to insufficient voter turnout, following calls for a boycott from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other right-wing political parties.

However, voter participation fell significantly below the required 50%, leading to the referendum's invalidation.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw, pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, expressed displeasure with the St. Louis Cardinals' pregame antics, which involved playing a replay of Matt Adams' clutch home run off Kershaw from the 2014 National League Division Series. Kershaw called the act "bush league", suggesting it was disrespectful, although he claimed it didn't bother him. Despite the perceived slight, Kershaw delivered a strong performance, pitching five innings and earning his first winning decision of the season. </p>

          <p>A medical tribunal determined that the failings of a doctor responsible for the care of Martha Mills, who died from sepsis, amounted to "gross negligence" and were "particularly grave". The tribunal found that consultant Prof Richard Thompson failed to recognize the severity of Martha's illness and did not examine her in person or send her to intensive care. Martha's death led to the implementation of Martha's Rule in hundreds of hospitals, granting parents the right to seek a second opinion. The tribunal concluded that Prof Thompson's fitness to practice is impaired, with potential sanctions to follow. </p>

          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that gun-related deaths among children and teens in the U.S. surged after states loosened firearm laws following a 2010 Supreme Court decision. Over 7,000 more children died from firearm-related injuries in the years following the decision, with most deaths occurring in states with more permissive gun laws. The study found a sharp increase in gun deaths among those aged 0 to 17 beginning in 2011, and firearms are now the leading cause of death in children and teens in the United States. Researchers analyzed over two decades of data, comparing trends in gun-related deaths before and after the legal shift, adjusting for background trends and comparing gun deaths to other causes. </p>

The ban includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, and individuals whose entry "serves U.S. national interests".
