          <p>The article details the emerging profile of Jihad Al-Shamie, the 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent responsible for the Manchester synagogue attack. Neighbors described him as a reclusive weightlifting enthusiast who kept to himself, alternating between Western and traditional Syrian clothing. Al-Shamie was not previously on the radar of counter-terrorism authorities, and checks are underway to see if he appeared in any past investigations. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressed surprise at his name, noting that "Jihad" is an uncommon first name for a Muslim.</p>

          <p>Financial experts at a recent forum emphasized that Hong Kong's role as a vital gateway to mainland China solidifies its strength as a global asset and wealth management hub. The city is expected to benefit significantly from China's continued economic opening, attracting more affluent individuals and innovative tech companies. This influx of capital and resources is predicted to create a favorable macroeconomic environment, lowering funding costs and enhancing business opportunities. Hong Kong's unique position within the Greater Bay Area allows it to act as a crucial 'superconnector' between mainland and international markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major victory for conservationists, eleven cheetah cubs were rescued from the illegal pet trade off the coast of Somaliland, a major transit hub for wildlife trafficking. The cubs, found packed in bags on a small boat, were in poor condition, with two dying shortly after the rescue despite intensive care. The Cheetah Conservation Fund is now rehabilitating the surviving animals, highlighting the severe threat the illegal pet trade poses to the endangered species, of which fewer than 7,000 remain in the wild. This incident underscores the urgent need to combat the demand for exotic pets in Gulf countries.</p>

Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, citing a history of violent behavior, while Combs' defense has requested 14 months, arguing he is a reformed man. The sentencing follows a trial where Combs was acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking. In a letter to the judge, Combs apologized for his past actions, while victim impact statements are also expected to be presented in court.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has expressed disappointment that pro-Palestinian demonstrations proceeded after a terror attack outside a Manchester synagogue, calling the decision to continue the protests "un-British." She urged demonstrators to reconsider future marches, citing the need for police resources to be focused on protective security and community reassurance. The comments came after clashes between police and protesters in London, leading to 40 arrests. The UK's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, also called for the government to address the demonstrations, linking the rhetoric on the streets to the synagogue attack.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are unprepared to effectively counter Donald Trump's political style. The author argues that their traditional, methodical communication methods are outdated in an era dominated by spectacle and social media virality. While acknowledging their political skill in a conventional sense, the piece suggests their approach feels tired and fails to energize the progressive base or compete in the current attention economy. The article concludes that without leaders who can match the theatrical and combative nature of modern politics, Democrats risk losing the political narrative.</p>

Retailers like Kroger deny any plans for surge pricing, stating the technology helps manage inventory and lower prices on perishable items. Economic studies suggest the practice could reduce food waste, and so far, there is no evidence of surge pricing being implemented.</p>

However, the legislation is filled with complex exemptions and deferrals for smaller cities, areas with high fire risk, and historic districts, making it difficult to determine its precise impact.

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have identified the two men killed in the terror attack outside a synagogue as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. The attack occurred on Yom Kippur when a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians and then attacked them with a knife before being shot and killed by police. The UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, stated that the attack was the result of an "unrelenting wave of Jew hatred," linking it to a rise in antisemitic incidents since the start of the war in Gaza. The investigation is ongoing, with police probing the attacker's motive and having made three related arrests.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair as a key figure in his 20-point plan for postwar Gaza. Blair, who was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, would serve on a "Board of Peace" aimed at rebuilding the region. However, his selection is highly controversial due to his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has made him a polarizing figure in the UK and internationally. Palestinian officials have offered a cautious welcome to the effort but some, including a Hamas representative, have strongly denounced Blair's involvement, casting doubt on the plan's viability.</p>

          <p>South Dakota Public Broadcasting has been forced to make severe cuts, including slashing its newsroom staff from eleven to four and dropping key public affairs shows, after Congress rescinded federal funding for public media. The loss of $2.3 million, nearly a quarter of its budget, has disproportionately affected the network, which serves a rural state where local news outlets are scarce. While the broadcaster has vowed to maintain coverage of high school sports and state legislature proceedings, the cuts mean more reliance on national programming from NPR and PBS. The situation reflects a nationwide crisis for public media, with layoffs and closures occurring at stations across the country.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are facing long-term unemployment, with 1.9 million people jobless for over six months, the highest level since 2021. As employers slow down hiring, the share of long-term unemployed has risen to 26% of all jobless individuals, a three-year high. The article shares personal stories of experienced professionals and recent graduates struggling to find work, submitting hundreds of applications with little success. Economists express concern that this trend could lead to financial hardship for individuals and may cause discouraged workers to exit the labor force entirely, posing a risk to the broader economy.</p>

          <p>Federally funded community health centers, which provide care to nearly 34 million low-income Americans, are facing a severe financial crisis due to the government shutdown and other funding cuts. The lapse in federal grant money, compounded by upcoming reductions to Medicaid, is forcing many of the 1,500 centers to consider cutting staff and services, with some facing potential closure. Advocates warn this could place additional strain on hospital emergency rooms as patients lose access to primary care. The situation highlights the precarious financial state of a crucial healthcare safety net that serves the country's most vulnerable populations.</p>

Residents and local leaders express a mix of desperation for a solution and apprehension about the deployment. While some, like State Rep. Antonio Parkinson, see it as an opportunity to leverage resources for the city, others worry about the potential for negative consequences and the political motivations behind the move. The city's leaders are trying to maintain cautious optimism, hoping the collaboration can serve as a model for state, federal, and local cooperation.</p>
