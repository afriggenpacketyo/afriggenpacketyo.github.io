          <p>Jimmy Kimmel Live! has returned to ABC after a week-long suspension, with host Jimmy Kimmel addressing his controversial remarks regarding the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel issued a public apology, stating it was never his intention to trivialize a young man's death or assign blame to any specific group, acknowledging that his comments were perceived as ill-timed or unclear by some viewers. The comedian's pre-taped monologue, which also highlighted the importance of free speech in America, was met with a warm reception and multiple standing ovations from the studio audience. His return follows a period of intense scrutiny from President Donald Trump and a decision by some ABC affiliates, including Nexstar and Sinclair, to initially preempt the show's broadcast, further intensifying the political and media landscape debates.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, has announced its plans to reopen next summer, a year after a devastating July flood of the Guadalupe River claimed the lives of 27 girls and counselors. The camp's reopening will strictly adhere to new safety legislation, bravely championed by the victims' families, which prohibits cabins in dangerous flood zones and mandates detailed emergency plans, staff training, and emergency warning systems. A heartfelt memorial will be constructed to honor those lost in the tragedy, which contributed to a total of 136 fatalities across Texas. While the original 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe remains too damaged for immediate use, its sister site, Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, is set to welcome campers, marking a step towards healing and enhanced safety.</p>

          <h2>Colombian President Calls for Trump Investigation at UNGA Amidst Global Discussions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 23:37:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the UN General Assembly, Colombian President Gustavo Petro made a significant call for a criminal investigation into US President Donald Trump. This demand stems from missile strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, which Trump had publicly vowed to "blow out of existence," leading to over a dozen deaths. Petro suspects some victims were Colombian, asserting that Trump should face a criminal process for ordering these "extrajudicial executions." Concurrently, European nations, including Germany, France, and Britain, are intensifying efforts for "last ditch" nuclear talks with Iran to avert sanctions, though German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed skepticism about a swift diplomatic resolution. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meeting with Trump, also surprisingly indicated he would nominate the US President for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully ends the ongoing war with Russia.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced widespread declines, mirroring Wall Street's downturn, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell publicly stated that "equity prices are fairly highly valued" and signaled an uncertain path for future rate cuts, describing the situation as "challenging." This sentiment impacted major regional indexes, with Australia's ASX/S&P 200, Japan's Nikkei 225, and South Korea's Kospi all recording slips. In a significant development for New Zealand, Anna Breman was appointed as the central bank's first female governor. Notably, South Korean defense stocks bucked the negative trend, posting gains following President Trump's recent expression of support for Ukraine and commitment to supplying weapons to NATO, positioning South Korea as a key military equipment supplier.

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding plans to significantly increase its capital expenditures on artificial intelligence infrastructure, surpassing the initially allocated 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over the next three years. CEO Eddie Wu Yongming, who also chairs Alibaba Cloud, announced this ambitious strategy at the Apsara Conference, articulating a vision for Alibaba Cloud to become the "world's leading full-stack AI service provider," from computing power to advanced models. Wu expressed a strong belief that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will usher in a new era, potentially automating 80% of current jobs and empowering "super scientists and engineers" to tackle global challenges in unprecedented ways. This substantial investment mirrors similar strategic moves by major US tech giants, such as Nvidia's recent $100 billion commitment to OpenAI.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has secured a special election victory in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, effectively taking over the congressional seat left vacant by her late father's passing. This win further erodes the Republican's already razor-thin majority in the House. Grijalva, who now holds the distinction of being Arizona's first Latina in Congress, defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the heavily Democratic-leaning district. Her campaign actively criticized President Donald Trump's agenda, particularly the "Big Ugly Bill," and she pledged immediate support for a discharge petition aimed at releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This outcome leaves Republicans with a 219-214 House majority, with two additional vacant seats in Texas and Tennessee still pending special elections later in the year.</p>

          <p>A malfunctioning escalator and a faulty teleprompter at the United Nations headquarters sparked President Trump's frustration, leading the White House to suggest potential intentional sabotage. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly called for an investigation and the firing of any UN staff who might have deliberately stopped the escalator, referencing earlier reports of UN workers joking about such actions. Conversely, a UN spokesman offered an alternative explanation, stating that a videographer from Trump's own delegation likely inadvertently triggered a built-in safety mechanism on the escalator. Separately, a UN official clarified that the White House staff was responsible for operating the teleprompter when it encountered issues during the President's address. The Secret Service is reportedly looking into the matter, which Trump integrated into his speech as a critique of the United Nations' perceived incompetence.</p>

Concurrently, major local station owners Sinclair and Nexstar Media Group confirmed their continued refusal to air "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" despite ABC's reinstatement, which will affect broadcasts in dozens of cities across the U.S. Sinclair had previously demanded that Kimmel apologize to Charlie Kirk's family and make a donation to Kirk's right-wing activist group, highlighting the deep political divisions surrounding the incident.</p>

          <p>Claudia Cardinale, the Tunisian-born Italian film star celebrated for her iconic roles in cinematic masterpieces such as The Leopard, 8 1/2, and The Pink Panther, has passed away at the age of 87. Her illustrious career spanned six decades, during which she rose to international prominence during the golden age of Italian cinema, collaborating with legendary directors like Federico Fellini and Luchino Visconti. The article reveals an early personal challenge: as a teenager, she was sexually assaulted and, upon discovering her pregnancy, was convinced by a mentor to give birth in secret abroad. For several years, she introduced her son, Patrick, as her younger brother. Cardinale also made a significant impact in Hollywood, starring with actors including Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson, leaving behind a profound legacy as a "free and inspired woman and artiste."</p>

          <p>A controversial and unauthorized bronze statue has appeared on the east end of the National Mall in Washington D.C., depicting President Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey Epstein "frolicking" and holding hands. A plaque at its base provocatively celebrates their "long-lasting bond" and includes verbatim quotes from an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, emphasizing that the two had "certain things in common." This sculpture, which has a permit to remain on the National Mall grounds through Sunday, is interpreted as a critical artistic piece aimed at the president. It serves to underscore a persistent and sensitive issue for Trump regarding his past association with the convicted sex trafficker, drawing thematic similarities to previous satirical art installations on the Mall that have been critical of his presidency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made several inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims regarding autism during a recent press conference, asserting a direct link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, and falsely claiming that Amish children, who he suggested do not receive vaccines, also do not develop autism. Medical evidence and numerous studies unequivocally refute these assertions, with health experts stating no direct causal link has been established between Tylenol and autism. Furthermore, autism is indeed diagnosed within Amish communities, though rates may appear lower due to factors like limited healthcare access. The article also debunks Trump's inaccurate statements about children receiving 80 vaccines and his questioning of the necessity for immediate Hepatitis B vaccination for newborns, underscoring the established safety and critical importance of the current pediatric vaccine schedule.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive Canadian investigation has concluded that TikTok's existing efforts to prevent underage users from accessing the app and to adequately protect children's personal data are insufficient, despite the platform's stated age restriction of 13 and over. The probe revealed that hundreds of thousands of Canadian children utilize TikTok annually and that the company had collected sensitive personal information from "a large number" of these children, subsequently using it for online marketing and content targeting. While TikTok disputes some of the findings, the company has agreed to implement enhanced measures to strengthen its platform for Canadian users. This report contributes to the growing global scrutiny surrounding the Chinese-owned app's impact on user safety and national security concerns, with President Trump also engaged in negotiations for a potential takeover of TikTok's US operations.</p>

The Cubs ultimately lost the game 1-0, and Shaw's absence meant the team was unable to bring in a replacement player, as he was ineligible for the bereavement list.

Trump's unexpected comments followed a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who subsequently hailed the "big shift" and expressed belief in an improved relationship with the American leader.

An investigation conducted by NHS Resolution, the health service's litigation arm, determined that the trust had not met the required safety measures, despite previously receiving funds from the Maternity Incentive Scheme. This reversal follows a damning report by the Care Quality Commission, which rated the trust's maternity services as inadequate, warning of "significant risk" to women and babies. The repayment underscores systemic issues within the Maternity Incentive Scheme, as a national analysis revealed 24 trusts have had to repay premiums. Families affected by poor care are now vocally demanding a full, independent inquiry into the Leeds trust's maternity services.</p>

Seattle-based AquaStar is the latest company to voluntarily pull three types of shrimp products, including Kroger and AquaStar branded items, which were sold in grocery stores across 31 states. Although no illnesses have been reported to date, the initial detection of the radioactive isotope occurred in an imported shipment from an Indonesia-based company, triggering this series of recalls. Experts emphasize that such frequent recalls specifically for Cesium-137 are highly unusual, suggesting potential contamination sources like past nuclear accidents, weapons testing, or even the use of food irradiators, though the FDA has previously stated irradiators do not make food radioactive.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh was found guilty by a Florida jury of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in September 2024. Routh, who chose to represent himself during the trial, was convicted on all five charges, which included attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer. A Secret Service agent testified that Routh aimed his rifle at the agent before being shot at, causing him to drop his weapon and flee without firing. Disturbingly, after the verdict was read, Routh reportedly attempted to harm himself, possibly using a pen, and was subsequently tackled by U.S. marshals. This incident marks the second assassination attempt against Trump in 2024. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized that the guilty verdict sends a clear message against political violence, with Routh now facing a potential life sentence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump returned to the United Nations General Assembly, marking a dramatic shift in his relationship with the global body since his last appearance, where he was once publicly mocked. His speech, described as meandering and grievance-filled, forcefully reiterated his "America First" doctrine, belittling the threat of climate change, issuing warnings against excessive immigration, and presenting himself as a global peacemaker despite the escalating wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Trump openly criticized the UN's perceived incompetence, even referencing his own escalator and teleprompter mishaps as metaphors for its failures. He also underscored US withdrawals from various UN agencies and significant funding cuts, which have led to a profound reordering of global alliances and priorities among nations as they rethink their reliance on the United States.</p>

          <p>Legendary pop star Lulu, aged 76, has candidly revealed her decades-long struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing the experience of sharing her story as profoundly liberating. Now approaching 12 years of sobriety, she sought help in 2013 after unexpectedly confiding in her family during her 65th birthday party, subsequently checking into rehab and committing to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu, who maintained the facade of a "highly functioning alcoholic" even during her participation in Strictly Come Dancing, had meticulously kept her problem secret from many, including her own son. She traces the roots of her struggles to a "war zone" childhood marked by an alcoholic and abusive father, expressing hope that sharing her story can help break generational patterns and inspire others.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young people are increasingly finding themselves unable to afford the transition out of their parents' homes, primarily due to the relentless rise in living costs, according to warnings from industry experts. Leoni Clancey, a 21-year-old, shared her personal experience of moving back home after her savings were rapidly depleted by the high expenses of utilities, council tax, and rent. Research conducted by the Skipton Group indicates that a staggering nine out of ten young adults currently living with their parents in the UK would face housing costs consuming nearly half of their income if they were to move out independently. This pervasive trend, which saw 4.9 million adults living with parents in 2021, creates significant financial and social challenges for both the younger generation and their families, impacting independence and future prospects.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a 19-year-old Chelsea forward, has effectively seized a first-team lifeline after a potential £22 million move to Fulham surprisingly fell through on deadline day. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George delivered a starring performance in Chelsea's Carabao Cup comeback victory against Lincoln City, where he scored a fine half-volley and then assisted the winning goal. This vital contribution comes as the academy graduate fights for his future at his boyhood club, especially given the influx of other attacking signings and injuries to key players. George's exceptional dedication, which included extensive personal training from a young age, has helped him disrupt the typical Chelsea academy pathway, positioning him for potential first-team success without the need for an initial loan spell.</p>

          <p>The dismembered body parts of an unknown woman, originally found along Oregon's Willamette River in April 1946, are now believed to be the remains of Oak Grove Jane Doe, marking the state's oldest unidentified person case. This complex investigation went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence, including the victim's remains, mysteriously went missing from law enforcement custody without proper documentation. The body was recently unearthed from a grave marked "Unknown Woman 1946" at Mountain View Cemetery in Oregon City. State police plan to subject the remains to advanced forensic testing and analysis, holding out hope to finally identify the petite white woman, estimated to be between 30 and 50 years old, who was determined to have been killed by blunt force trauma. The goal is to restore her name and identity to history after nearly 80 years.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, identified as the world's most powerful tropical cyclone this year, has severely impacted the region, lashing Hong Kong with hurricane-force winds and torrential rain, while also tragically causing 14 fatalities in Taiwan. In Taiwan, intense heavy rains from the typhoon's outer rim led to an overflowing barrier lake in Hualien county, which sent a devastating wall of water into a town. Hong Kong experienced massive waves that submerged roads and residential properties, prompting the city to issue its highest typhoon signal 10, resulting in widespread business and transport closures and panic buying. The typhoon is expected to maintain its super typhoon intensity as it moves towards the coast of China's Guangdong province, triggering mass evacuations and extensive emergency preparations for tens of millions of people in its path.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike scored the winning goal in a Carabao Cup match against Southampton, securing a 2-1 victory, but was immediately sent off for removing his shirt in celebration, having already received a yellow card earlier in the game. Manager Arne Slot publicly criticized Ekitike's actions as "stupid, not smart," expressing his bemusement that the player likely forgot his previous booking. This unnecessary sending-off means Ekitike will be suspended for an upcoming Premier League game against Crystal Palace, a significant setback given his excellent form since joining Liverpool for £69 million. Ekitike later issued an apology on social media, acknowledging that his emotions got the better of him, while Slot expressed hope that the young player will learn from this "important learning experience" to avoid similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <p>Aakash Singh, a top Department of Justice (DoJ) official who is actively directing aggressive prosecutions of minor crimes in Washington D.C., pleaded guilty to driving under the influence four years ago, according to recent findings. Experts deem his subsequent elevation to associate deputy attorney general, following a relatively brief legal career, as unusual given his criminal history. Singh, promoted under the Trump administration, has faced criticism for allegedly advising prosecutors to prioritize misdemeanor charges and even impanel new grand juries if felony indictments fail, leading to an unprecedented number of "no bills." This revelation raises significant questions of hypocrisy, as the DoJ is typically stringent about criminal backgrounds, especially when contrasted with the recent firing of another DoJ paralegal for a minor incident, highlighting a perceived double standard within the department.</p>

Another medic detailed the dire lack of resources and the long waits for urgent surgeries. The hospital, once Gaza's largest, now lies in ruins, struggling to cope as Israel expands its ground offensive to fully occupy what it calls Hamas's "main stronghold," leading to further displacement and a deepening humanitarian crisis for civilians trapped in the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a pioneering and highly respected scholar of Chinese law, has passed away at the age of 95. For over six decades, Cohen profoundly shaped global debates on China's complex legal system, its trade relations, and human rights issues. As professor emeritus at New York University’s School of Law and the founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, he held the distinction of being the first American to practice law in Communist China. He authored groundbreaking works on Chinese criminal procedure and China's interactions with international law, which remain widely read. Known for his dual role as an advocate for Chinese dissidents and a proponent of continued engagement with Beijing, Cohen leaves a towering and influential legacy in the field, having impacted generations of legal scholars and experts on Asian law.</p>
