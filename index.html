          <h2>China's Export Surge to Southeast Asia Counters US Trade Decline Amid Tariff War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:22:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, driven primarily by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which helped offset a sharp decline in trade with the United States due to recently imposed tariffs. Exports rose by 8.1% year-on-year, while imports saw a slight decrease of 0.2%. Despite this overall growth, exports to the U.S. fell by over 21%, and imports from the U.S. dropped by nearly 14%, according to official customs data. This shift in trade dynamics highlights China's strategy to diversify its export markets amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., as the Chinese government encourages exporters to focus on domestic sales to mitigate the economic impact of tariffs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Multiple news outlets report on the new trade agreement between the US and the UK, noting its potential to alleviate some tariffs imposed by the White House. The agreement includes concessions on car and steel exports for the UK, though a flat 10% levy on most goods remains. The deal also includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim disputed by a government spokesperson. The agreement is described as 'historic' by both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, though some reports suggest its scope is limited and leaves Britain in a worse position than before the trade war began.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article discusses the resurgence of U.S. strategic interest in Greenland, driven by its geographic importance in the Arctic and the implications of climate change. Greenland's location makes it crucial for monitoring routes between Russia and the U.S., especially with the opening of the Arctic Sea due to melting ice. Russia's increasing assertiveness in the Arctic, including military presence and economic cooperation with China, has heightened U.S. concerns. The article suggests a potential resolution to tensions within NATO by applying a model similar to the "Compact of Free Association" used in the Pacific, granting the U.S. military rights in exchange for economic support.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow, a grand celebration of the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany, attended by leaders from over 20 countries, including China and Brazil. The parade is being used to showcase Russia's past glories and justify the war in Ukraine, amidst faltering attempts to end the conflict. Ukraine has increased its attacks on Moscow and surrounding areas in the days leading up to the parade, raising concerns about potential disruptions. The parade symbolizes Russia's shift towards closer ties with countries in the 'global south' as a counterweight to the West.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the impact of the Trump administration's policies on the offshore wind industry, particularly in the United States. A halt to construction of a wind farm off Long Island has sent shockwaves through the industry, leading European executives to reassess their approach to renewable energy investments in the U.S. While Europe remains committed to offshore wind, with expectations of significant growth in the coming decades, uncertainty looms over existing U.S. projects due to tariffs and policy shifts. Companies like Vestas are adapting by geographically diversifying their manufacturing to mitigate the impact of tariffs and other measures.</p>

The administration plans a welcome event for the Afrikaners upon their arrival, highlighting the disparity in processing times compared to other refugees, who often wait years. This move follows Trump's executive order suspending refugee admissions and cutting U.S. aid to South Africa. Advocates criticize the administration's inaction on other refugees, even in the face of court orders, while prioritizing this group.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that tariffs on goods from China may decrease as trade officials from both countries prepare for discussions. Trump stated that the tariffs, currently at 145%, are likely to be reduced, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war. China has also expressed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S. The upcoming meeting in Switzerland is seen as a positive step, though analysts caution that lengthy negotiations are expected. Experts suggest that any tariff cuts resulting from the meeting are likely to be minor, with significant systemic issues remaining between the two nations.</p>

However, it is expected that trade data will gradually weaken in the coming months, pending a trade agreement between China and the US.</p>

          <p>According to a mines developer, developed nations are waking up to the need to diversify their raw material supply sources after three decades of readily available exports from China came to a sudden halt, specifically concerning tungsten. China added tungsten to its export restriction list in February, causing panic in the industry as companies have relied on Chinese raw materials for 30 years. The US defense contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. The element is used in ammunition, armor, cutting tools, drill bits, and clean energy applications.</p>

The sources said a press conference was planned for the group's arrival at Dulles airport, which would be attended by high level officials from the Departments of State and Homeland Security. The sources said it is unusual for refugees to be welcomed at the airport by U.S. dignitaries, and said the process of interviewing them in South Africa and granting them refugee status has been unusually quick.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney for Washington DC. Pirro, a long-time ally of Trump, replaces Ed Martin, who will now serve as director of the 'weaponization working group'. The appointment comes after Trump withdrew his first pick for the job after he lost key Republican support in the Senate. Pirro has been a close ally of Trump for decades. In one of his last actions during his first term, Trump issued a pardon to her husband, who had been convicted of tax evasion decades earlier.</p>

Some analysts criticize the deal for potentially disadvantaging American carmakers and benefiting wealthy consumers. Republicans, however, are celebrating the agreement as a step toward eliminating trade barriers and strengthening supply chains.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for those earning over $2.5 million, taxed at 39.6%.
