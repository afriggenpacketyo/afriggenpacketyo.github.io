The Soyuz MS-26 spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan, marking the end of Pettit's fourth mission and bringing his total time in space to 590 days. Pettit has noted that his return to Earth can be difficult for him, but the crew will undergo testing and rehabilitation to adjust to gravity after orbiting the Earth 3,520 times during their stay.

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to launch at 750 schools across England, offering parents access to half an hour of free morning childcare. The trial program, running until July, aims to provide up to 95 additional hours of childcare per year, potentially saving parents £450. While teaching unions welcome the initiative, concerns have been raised that government funding may be insufficient to cover the full costs. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized that the program aims to break down barriers to opportunity.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have reportedly detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen-based explosive device, creating a large fireball without using nuclear materials. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, utilized a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. When activated, the material released hydrogen gas that ignited into a sustained inferno, triggering devastating chemical chain reactions. The researchers claim the bomb generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for more than two seconds, without using any nuclear materials.</p>
