        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports indicate the FBI is considering a "showy" public arrest of its former director, James Comey, following his indictment for allegedly lying to Congress. An FBI agent was reportedly suspended for refusing to participate in the plan, which sources described as involving agents in full tactical gear to create a public spectacle. This potential move is highly controversial, with critics arguing it undermines the presumption of innocence, a practice Comey himself was criticized for during his time as a federal prosecutor. The situation highlights the escalating feud between Comey and former President Trump, who publicly pressured for the investigation into his longtime adversary.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a railway station in Shostka, Ukraine, has injured at least 30 people, an act Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as "savage" terrorism. The strike is part of a broader Russian campaign targeting Ukraine's rail and power infrastructure ahead of the winter, aiming to disrupt military transport and civilian life. In response, Ukraine has continued its own drone campaign, reportedly striking one of Russia's largest oil refineries near St. Petersburg, which has contributed to fuel shortages within Russia. The conflict also claimed the life of a French photojournalist killed in a separate drone strike in eastern Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Following Nicole Kidman's filing for divorce from Keith Urban after 19 years of marriage, this article examines the history of high-profile relationship breakdowns within her close circle of Hollywood friends. The piece draws parallels between Kidman's situation and the public scandals and heartbreaks experienced by stars like Sandra Bullock, whose husband's infidelity became a major story, and Reese Witherspoon, who recently divorced. It also notes the recent divorce of longtime friend Hugh Jackman from Deborra-Lee Furness. The article suggests that while Kidman and Urban's split is making headlines, navigating public relationship turmoil is a familiar experience for her and her peers.</p>

          <p>The Chinese military has disclosed a past incident where one of its J-16 fighter jets successfully intercepted and expelled two foreign stealth fighter jets from its coastal airspace. A pilot involved in the encounter described performing aggressive maneuvers, including a barrel roll, to get into a superior position just meters away from one of the foreign aircraft. After achieving a weapons lock on both jets, the foreign aircraft reportedly departed the area. The report did not specify the nationality of the stealth fighters or the exact date of the incident, but noted that this type of aircraft has not been seen near China's coast since.</p>

          <h2>Speaker Johnson Delays Swearing-In of New Arizona Democrat Amid Speculation Over Epstein Files Vote</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly elected Democratic Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona was not sworn into office by House Speaker Mike Johnson this week, preventing her from beginning her congressional duties. Grijalva and her supporters speculate the delay is politically motivated, as her signature would be the final one needed on a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move Johnson and Donald Trump oppose.

          <p>This opinion piece discusses new research showing that prosecutors in 16 states have charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes in the two years since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Most cases involve low-income women and allegations of substance use, with some prosecutions using laws intended to protect children, not fetuses, thereby advancing the concept of "fetal personhood." The author expresses concern that this trend could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals' behavior. The article draws parallels to El Salvador's total abortion ban and its severe consequences for women who experience pregnancy complications, suggesting a worrying direction for the U.S.</p>

As the court's most frequent dissenter last term, Jackson has consistently challenged the conservative majority's decisions on issues like abortion, voting rights, and presidential power.

Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon, then just a bookstore, would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000 by expanding into numerous product categories. The opportunity to be part of such rapid, foundational growth proved irresistible, and Amazon ultimately surpassed Bezos's revenue prediction a year ahead of schedule.</p>

          <p>The Urenco USA facility in New Mexico, the only commercial uranium enrichment plant in the United States, is expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This renewed interest is driven by projected electricity needs from AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing, coupled with a looming ban on Russian uranium imports by 2028. The plant, which currently supplies about a third of U.S. demand, is increasing its capacity by 15% but faces broader supply chain bottlenecks, particularly in uranium conversion.

Internal critics point to a lack of pace and public engagement from Badenoch, while supporters urge patience, comparing her to a young Margaret Thatcher.

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter as an ideal time to conduct a thorough review of personal finances. With most of the year's financial data available, individuals can make informed decisions for year-end tax planning, which is especially important this year due to changes from President Trump's recent tax bill. These changes include a temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Experts also advise creating a budget for the upcoming holiday season to avoid starting the new year with financial stress, as a significant percentage of Americans typically take on debt for holiday spending.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly halted its offensive military operations in the Gaza Strip, a move intended to allow Hamas to organize for the release of hostages as part of a ceasefire proposal from President Trump. An Israeli official clarified that this is not an official ceasefire and that the military will respond if its troops are targeted. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to begin in Egypt, which will test the seriousness of Hamas's recent positive statements about the deal. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the developments and called for an immediate commitment to a complete ceasefire and the release of all hostages.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that the UK will withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if her party wins the next election. The decision follows a party legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs migration reform and leads to the legal persecution of military veterans. This policy marks a significant shift for the party, which has been internally divided on the issue, and is seen as a move to counter growing pressure from the right-wing Reform UK party. Labour criticized the announcement as a sign of weakness, arguing Badenoch adopted a policy she previously opposed.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly embracing science fiction and speculative fiction as a tool of soft power, aiming to challenge the dominance of Western narratives about the future. Academics note that the genre has historically been shaped by Euro-American perspectives, often projecting dystopian and pessimistic capitalist futures. By fostering its own speculative fiction, China seeks to present alternative visions and critique the present from a different ideological standpoint. This cultural push is part of a broader strategy to stake a claim on how the future is imagined and discussed on a global stage, moving beyond traditional economic and military influence.</p>

          <p>Dr. Debra Houry, the former chief medical officer of the CDC, has raised alarms about the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., describing his approach as a "hostile takeover" of the agency. In testimony and an interview, Houry stated that Kennedy avoided meetings with top health experts even during deadly outbreaks and pushed for unprecedented, scientifically unsupported changes to the childhood immunization schedule. She claims she was never able to brief the secretary and only learned of major policy changes, like restricting COVID vaccines, through social media. Her account paints a picture of an agency where scientific expertise is being systematically dismantled.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, some Black, brown, and queer college students are voicing concern over his sudden deification and the negative repercussions for their communities. Students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have faced racist threats and unauthorized visits from conservative activists, while some students of color at other schools have been disciplined for mocking Kirk's death. These students express frustration that they are being unfairly blamed for his death and that the focus on Kirk ignores the hateful rhetoric he directed at marginalized groups.

The company, which has already completed 8 million deliveries, is working with partners like the Co-op and Grubhub. While facing competition and regulatory hurdles that vary by location, Heinla is confident that robotic delivery is on the cusp of widespread adoption, arguing it will meet burgeoning demand rather than replacing human jobs.</p>

          <p>A new progressive party in the UK, provisionally named 'Your Party,' has been plagued by public infighting just as it attempts to launch, revealing deep internal divisions. Co-leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, both former Labour MPs, are at odds over the party's direction, culminating in Corbyn publicly disavowing a membership drive initiated by Sultana's faction. The dispute reflects broader disagreements over strategy, with some factions focused on grassroots activism and others on electoral politics. This turmoil, combined with the UK's first-past-the-post system, presents significant obstacles for the party's goal of challenging Labour from the left without inadvertently helping right-wing rivals.</p>

          <p>The creation of 'Tilly Norwood,' a hyperreal AI-generated actress, by a UK production company has triggered a significant backlash from actors and unions in Hollywood. SAG-AFTRA condemned the move, stating that creativity should remain human-centered and opposing the replacement of performers with synthetics. While the creator claims AI is a tool, not a replacement, prominent actors have called the development "terrifying," and major talent agencies have publicly stated they will not represent a synthetic client. The controversy highlights the industry's deep-seated anxiety over generative AI, particularly its potential to replace background and voice actors, which was a central issue in the recent actors' strike.</p>

These detentions have intensified since the 2024 election, with critics accusing the Maduro regime of using these individuals as political hostages to extort concessions from foreign governments.

Daulby was reportedly killed accidentally by an officer's bullet as congregants tried to barricade the entrance. The attacker, who was out on bail for an alleged sexual assault, may have been influenced by "extreme Islamist ideology," according to detectives.

          <p>Director Lou Ye's latest movie, 'An Unfinished Film,' offers a rare and honest portrayal of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, following a film crew quarantined near Wuhan in 2020. Though censored in mainland China, the film has received international acclaim, not for its simple plot, but for its courage in tackling a sensitive subject. The review notes that the film captures the chaos of the initial lockdown but conspicuously omits the mass infections and deaths that followed the abrupt end of the 'zero-COVID' policy. This silence reflects a broader societal reticence, making the film an essential but incomplete processing of collective trauma.</p>
