          <p>A Los Angeles judge has scheduled a resentencing hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez for May 13 and 14, following numerous postponements and legal challenges. The Menendez brothers have been incarcerated since 1990 for the shotgun murders of their parents in 1989. The brothers allege years of sexual assault by their father, with their mother complicit. The upcoming hearing will consider whether they should be eligible for parole, with family members and correctional officials expected to testify about their rehabilitation. District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes resentencing, arguing they haven't fully acknowledged their crimes. The judge rejected Hochman's request to withdraw the resentencing petition, and the hearing will proceed.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is actively exploring the possibility of suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge the legality of detention, in cases related to illegal immigration. Miller argues that the Constitution allows for such suspension during times of invasion, reflecting the administration's view of undocumented migrants. This consideration comes amid pending civil cases challenging the deportation of undocumented immigrants, raising concerns about the legal and constitutional implications of such a move.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As home equity levels rise, homeowners are increasingly using HELOCs as a financing source, which offers lower interest rates than other borrowing options. A key component to HELOC success is having a solid payoff strategy, as the home serves as collateral. The article highlights strategies for HELOC borrowers, including taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest, monitoring the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and strategically using the HELOC for home repairs and renovations to potentially gain tax deductions. Homeowners should speak with a lending expert to develop a personalized repayment strategy, as the best approach will depend on individual budgets and long-term financial goals.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a brief radar outage, exacerbating concerns about safety and technological reliability at the busy airport. The outage, lasting about 90 seconds, affected communications and radar displays at a Philadelphia facility. This incident follows a similar outage the previous week, which caused significant disruptions and staffing issues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to modernize the air traffic control system, but the latest outage has intensified pressure on officials to act quickly and address the ongoing technical problems. United Airlines, which heavily relies on Newark as a hub, has expressed frustration over the airport's capacity and called for a reversal of a 2016 decision that loosened flight restrictions.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from environmental activists. While many religious figures lauded Mr. Zeldin's public display of faith, environmentalists argued that his actions contradict the Jewish value of tikkun olam, the obligation to repair the world, given his efforts to weaken environmental regulations. Mr. Zeldin defended his policies as being based on law and science, while critics argue that his decisions prioritize corporate interests over environmental protection. The event has ignited a broader discussion about the intersection of faith, environmental stewardship, and political responsibility.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the shingles vaccine may have unexpected benefits for heart health, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease for up to eight years. The study, analyzing data from over 1.2 million people aged 50 or older in South Korea, found a 23% lower risk of heart issues, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary artery disease, among those vaccinated. The benefits were more significant for younger individuals and those with unhealthy behaviors. Researchers propose that preventing shingles may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation that can lead to heart disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess the effectiveness of different types of shingles vaccines across diverse populations.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), was fired by President Trump after he and two other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. Trumka claims his dismissal is illegal and plans to challenge it in court. He argues that DOGE's involvement would undermine the agency's life-saving work. Consumer Reports has condemned the firings and called for the commissioners to be reinstated, emphasizing the importance of an independent product safety watchdog. The White House contends that the CPSC falls under the executive branch, granting the president the authority to fire employees.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt case. Fortnite was removed from iPhones in 2020 after Epic Games circumvented Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website. The recent ruling prohibits Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, potentially paving the way for Fortnite's return. However, Apple, which is appealing the ruling, still has the option to reject Fortnite's submission.

The test, developed by Teal Health, involves vaginal swabbing and is designed to detect HPV, which causes almost all cervical cancer cases. Patients can order the test online, consult with a telehealth provider, collect the sample, and mail it for testing. A positive test result will require a follow-up appointment for a Pap smear or colposcopy. Experts believe this at-home option could increase screening rates and help eradicate cervical cancer, but it should not be seen as a complete replacement for regular gynecological exams.</p>

          <p>A former model testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, alleging that he sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and forcibly performed oral sex on her years later. Kaja Sokola told the court that Weinstein made her touch his genitals in 2002 and forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. Weinstein's lawyers sought to discredit Sokola's allegations, pointing out that she did not mention the 2006 assault in previous lawsuits. Weinstein, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for a 2022 sexual assault conviction in California, has pleaded not guilty to all charges and denies sexually assaulting anyone.</p>
