          <p>President Trump has criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This attack came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled against Trump's tariffs, leading to a clash with some conservative legal theories. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming they provided poor advice on judicial nominations and are under Leo's influence. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the federal courts. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration had threatened to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the tariffs were not reinstated quickly.

The appeals court's pause provides temporary relief as the case continues. </p>

          <p>Nika Melia, a key figure in Georgia's largest opposition group, Coalition for Change, has been detained by police, accused of insulting law enforcement officers. This is the second such detention in recent days, following the pre-trial detention of another Coalition for Change leader, Zurab Japaridze. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of mimicking authoritarian tactics and steering the country away from Europe and towards Russia. The government denies these allegations, though membership of the EU remains a popular goal among Georgians. </p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an Oval Office press conference with Elon Musk, marking the end of Musk's official role in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's government service is ending due to the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. DOGE has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though Democrats in Congress have criticized Musk's influence. Tesla shares rose following news of his return to the private sector. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is ending after 129 days marked by significant spending cuts and controversy. DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various measures, though a BBC analysis found some evidence lacking. Musk's presence in the White House, given his business interests, raised ethical questions and concerns about potential conflicts of interest. His work led to the elimination of most USAID programs, reflecting an "America First" approach, and his promotion of conspiracy theories has been criticized. </p>

          <p>U.S.-China trade talks "are a bit stalled," requiring direct communication between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Despite a recent agreement to roll back tariff increases, the U.S. has maintained tech restrictions on Beijing, while China has yet to ease restrictions on rare earths. Bessent believes that the complexity of the talks necessitates involvement from both leaders. Analysts suggest China will only agree to a call if there is certainty of no surprises from the U.S. during the conversation. </p>
