          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM," identifying itself as a technology company rather than a traditional bank. Chime generates revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases made using its debit and credit cards, reporting $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue for the March quarter, with a 32% revenue growth. The company offers various services, including free tax filing and early access to earned pay, and states that around two-thirds of its members use Chime as their primary financial relationship. However, the IPO plans were delayed due to market volatility following tariff announcements.</p>

          <p>Representative Adam Schiff, along with other Senate Democrats, has called for the Department of Defense's Inspector General to investigate the Trump administration's potential acceptance of a luxury jet from the Qatari government. The letter expresses concerns that the DOD might be used to facilitate an impermissible gift and place the burden of retrofitting the plane on U.S. taxpayers, ultimately transferring it to President Trump's library for personal use. The senators requested a comprehensive audit into potential fraud, waste, and abuse related to the transfer, along with details on the costs and timelines for retrofitting the plane to meet Air Force One standards. This request comes amid concerns about constitutional limitations on accepting foreign gifts without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Two juvenile males, aged 12 and 13, have been arrested and charged with capital murder in Austin, Texas, following the death of 20-year-old Anthony Salas. The suspects allegedly shot Salas and struck him with a vehicle during a carjacking incident that occurred on May 3. Police reports indicate that the suspects had been burglarizing multiple vehicles in south and east Austin prior to the incident. The Travis County Sheriff's Office initially received a call about a stolen vehicle, followed by a report of a person hit by a vehicle near Del Valle Elementary School, leading to the discovery of Salas's death.</p>

          <p>During Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, a narrative strategy emerged that seeks to reinterpret historical events related to World War II. Chinese and Russian officials emphasized the roles of China and the Soviet Union in bearing the primary burden of defeating fascism, while downplaying the contributions of the U.S., Britain, and other Allied nations. This narrative aims to position China and Russia as inheritors of the anti-fascist tradition and challenges the foundations of the post-World War II global order. The goal is to reshape the world order established after 1989, which currently operates under U.S. influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is cutting an additional $450 million in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns that the institution has become a "breeding ground for virtue signaling and discrimination." The federal antisemitism task force claims Harvard will lose grants from eight federal agencies, adding to the $2.2 billion previously frozen by the administration. University President Alan Garber has disputed the government's allegations, insisting that Harvard is nonpartisan and has taken steps to address antisemitism on campus. Harvard is suing to block the federal funding freeze, calling the sanctions an unlawful attempt to control the university's operations.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has announced the reinstatement of Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. This policy change means bans will expire upon death, allowing Rose and Jackson to be considered for induction as early as 2028. Rose, who agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, now have the opportunity for posthumous recognition. The Hall of Fame's board will consider the candidacies of those affected by Manfred's ruling.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reported that as few as three radar controllers were monitoring Newark's airspace on Monday night, despite a target of 14, due to a national shortage of air traffic controllers. This staffing shortage comes as Newark Liberty International Airport faces technological issues, worker shortages, and runway construction, leading to flight cancellations and delays. The FAA has slowed arrivals and departures to ensure safety, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that these measures are to guarantee safety, not to annoy or delay travelers. Management of flight traffic at Newark was moved to Philadelphia last summer, and the FAA is working to address the challenges.</p>

Douthat argues that both right-wing and left-wing perspectives can capture aspects of reality in a non-propagandistic way, citing V.S. Naipaul's novels and the "Star Wars" series "Andor" as examples. He concludes that politically themed art succeeds not through conversion, but through unsettling viewers and readers with unexpected truths, fostering sympathy for differing perspectives.</p>

          <p>A recent article assesses Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) as a leading pharmaceutical stock amid President Trump's efforts to incentivize domestic manufacturing. With pharmaceutical production shifting overseas, Trump's executive order aims to streamline the process for pharmaceutical companies to build new U.S. production sites. The order directs the FDA to expedite reviews, remove unnecessary requirements, and increase inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants. This initiative seeks to reduce reliance on foreign pharmaceutical imports and bolster national security by encouraging domestic production.</p>

          <p>Three key House committees are meeting to advance President Trump's budget package, which addresses defense, energy, and tax priorities, with Republican leaders aiming for a floor vote next week. The committees are debating proposals that include changes to Medicaid and food stamps to fund tax cuts, but significant divisions remain among Republicans, particularly on Medicaid overhauls and expiring tax deductions. The bill faces pushback from both moderate and conservative Republicans, as well as strong opposition from Democrats, who criticize the proposals as harmful to low-income individuals and beneficial to the wealthy.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit alleging racial bias against Black employees, covering approximately 4,000 employees in California and New York. The lawsuit, filed by former Google worker April Curley, claimed Black employees were hired for lower-level jobs, paid lower wages, subjected to hostile comments, and denied promotions. Google maintains it did not violate any laws but has agreed to analyze pay and correct differences based on race for the next three years. The company will also maintain transparent salary ranges and methods for employees to report concerns, and will not require mandatory arbitration for employment-related disputes through August 2026.</p>

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Medicaid, but the House Republican bill to fund his agenda aims to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. Despite his promises, Trump urged Republicans to "UNIFY" around the bill, which proposes to slash Medicaid spending through work requirements, frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to undocumented immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposal would save $715 billion over the next decade but result in at least 8.6 million more Americans becoming uninsured. This contrasts with Trump's past statements, where he claimed he would "Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts."</p>

The vote passed by 70 to 56, marking a significant step forward for the bill, which now requires two more phases of parliamentary scrutiny before becoming law. The bill has garnered support from various MSPs, who cited powerful testimony from family members and constituents, while opponents raised concerns about safeguards for vulnerable people. The Scottish government remains officially neutral on the matter, with First Minister John Swinney acknowledging that significant issues would be raised at the next stage.</p>

Civil liberties groups argue that this demand does not comply with federal laws and could lead to government surveillance on an unprecedented scale.

This situation leaves them in a difficult position, as they are hesitant to remain on the sidelines and miss potential gains, yet wary of the economic impact of the remaining tariffs.
