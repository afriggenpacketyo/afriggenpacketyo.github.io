          <p>A man has been arrested after driving a car into a crowd of people outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 individuals, with at least five reported to be in critical condition. The suspect, identified as Fernando Ramirez, was apprehended after fleeing the scene on foot and faces potential attempted murder charges. The incident, which also involved a taco truck and a valet stand, is now under a large-scale investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department.

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reports that Israeli forces have killed at least 67 Palestinians who were waiting for aid trucks in the northern part of the territory. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated they fired warning shots to disperse a crowd that posed an immediate threat and disputes the number of casualties. This incident is part of a pattern of deadly events near aid distribution points, exacerbating a dire humanitarian crisis. Concurrently, the IDF has issued new evacuation orders for parts of central Gaza, causing panic among displaced residents and families of Israeli hostages.</p>

          <p>Employment experts suggest that many companies are using vague terms like 'restructuring' or 'optimization' to obscure the fact that recent job cuts are directly linked to the adoption of artificial intelligence. While firms like IBM and Klarna have been more transparent, most are hesitant to explicitly state they are replacing human workers with AI, fearing public and employee backlash. Experts note that roles in customer service, HR, and content creation are particularly affected. This strategic silence allows companies to reshape their workforce through automation while managing public perception during a period of significant technological transition.</p>

          <p>In the race for New York City mayor, independent candidates Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo are publicly criticizing each other to appeal to voters who oppose the far-left Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani. At a recent event, Cuomo indirectly criticized Adams's leadership, suggesting the city has lacked a competent mayor since 2013. In response, Adams accused Cuomo of creating messes like bail reform that he had to fix. Both candidates are positioning themselves as the viable alternative to Mamdani, attacking his progressive policies to court moderate and conservative support in the election.</p>

Drawing from his experience learning to surf with his politically opposite brother-in-law, Litt argues that shared activities can foster friendships and meaningful discussions despite deep disagreements. He posits that focusing on something other than differences allows people to connect on a human level, building a foundation for more constructive dialogue. This approach, he suggests, is a practical way to navigate a society where nearly every topic has become politicized.</p>

The incident, which occurred on the opera's closing night, drew a mixed reaction from the audience, with some supporting the performer's 'brave' gesture and others feeling it overshadowed the performance.

Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence.

Amid conflicting data from government and private sources, the author contends that the rise of the 'over-employed,' side gigs, and remote work means 'income' is a more relevant measure than 'jobs.' The piece calls for a new system that tracks how many Americans earn above a certain threshold from all sources, adjusted for inflation.

Local leaders and business owners are planning events, historical tours, and new amenities to attract the anticipated flood of visitors for the centennial.

According to personality scientist Shannon Sauer-Zavala, consciously changing one's patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving over time can lead to fundamental personality shifts. This approach involves forcing oneself to act contrary to natural inclinations, which, while difficult, can be a powerful tool for personal growth and improving mental health.</p>

          <p>In an interview about her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her trailblazing career and the political challenges facing the nation. She recounts facing racism, including from Senator Jesse Helms, and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in American politics. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is 'walking around in a daze' in its response to Donald Trump. Despite recent backsliding on civil rights, she remains optimistic that Americans value democracy and will ultimately reject authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the complex and often contradictory history of Oklahoma as a microcosm of the American experience, built on land theft, racial violence, and reinvention. The author reflects on growing up with sanitized historical narratives, like re-enacting land runs that dispossessed Indigenous nations, and the state's embrace of 'Sooners' who cheated to claim land. The article also highlights the forgotten dream of Edward McCabe to create an all-Black state in the territory. Ultimately, the author argues that grappling with this difficult past is essential to understanding the nation's present-day political and cultural conflicts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. This shift corresponds with a perception that the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. The poll also reveals continued public concern over the economy, with most Americans wanting the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. While Trump's base remains strongly supportive, his overall approval has slipped, particularly among Hispanic Americans and independents.</p>

          <p>A recent study analyzing Census Bureau data found that major U.S. cities, led by New York City and Los Angeles, are experiencing the highest net loss of residents aged 60 and over. In 2023, nearly 24,000 more seniors moved out of New York City than moved in. Many of the cities with the largest outflow of retirees are in states with a high cost of living, like California and New York, where over $1 million is often needed for a comfortable retirement. While reasons for moving vary, the financial burden of living in these expensive urban areas appears to be a significant factor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece, written by a naturalized U.S. citizen, expresses fear and uncertainty over the Trump administration's pledge to 'maximally pursue' denaturalization cases. The author argues that this policy, combined with rhetoric questioning the citizenship of political opponents, undermines the principle that all citizens have the same permanent rights. The essay reflects on the U.S. civics test, questioning whether its promises of constitutional protections and the rule of law still hold true. The author warns that even a few denaturalization cases could have a chilling effect on the free speech of millions of naturalized Americans.</p>

          <p>A naturalized U.S. citizen who works for the U.S. Commerce Department has been blocked from leaving China for several months after being detained upon arrival in April. The individual, who was on a personal trip to visit relatives, is reportedly subject to an exit ban on national security grounds. One report suggests the detention is due to a failure to disclose his U.S. government employment on his visa application. This incident highlights the ongoing risk of exit bans in China, where foreign citizens, particularly those of Chinese descent, can be held for extended periods without formal charges.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has vowed to remain in his position despite his ruling coalition losing its majority in the upper house of parliament in Sunday's election. The defeat, driven by public frustration over inflation and political scandals, critically undermines his government's ability to pass legislation. Ishiba cited the need to lead critical trade negotiations with the United States as his reason for staying on. The election also saw a surge for the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which gained momentum with its anti-immigration and 'Japanese First' rhetoric, adding a new layer of complexity to the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists believe they have identified the 300-year-old wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as 'La Buse.' The ship, found near Madagascar, was laden with treasure that would be worth over $100 million today. This discovery could be a key piece in solving the mystery of La Buse's legendary hidden treasure, which he cryptically alluded to with a note thrown to the crowd before his execution. For centuries, adventurers have searched for the pirate's fabled riches, and this shipwreck may provide vital new clues.</p>

          <p>In a significant archaeological find at the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, a previously unknown tomb has been discovered directly beneath the iconic Khazneh, or 'Treasury.' A team led by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman used ground-penetrating radar to locate the tomb before excavating. Inside, they found the articulated skeletal remains of 12 individuals dating back over 2,000 years, along with various artifacts. Unlike many tombs at the site, this one had not been looted, providing a rare opportunity for scientists to learn more about the Nabataean people who built the magnificent city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States' recent trade arrangements with Southeast Asian nations represent a strategic shift away from mutual partnership toward a transactional, 'rent-seeking' model. Instead of fostering integration, Washington is allegedly monetizing access to its market by imposing higher tariffs and demanding mandatory purchases from ASEAN members. The author contends that this approach may secure short-term gains for the U.S. but ultimately undermines the economic competitiveness and sovereignty of the region's countries. The article points to dramatically increased tariffs on exports from countries like Vietnam and Indonesia as evidence of this new strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Lowy Institute think tank indicates that China's influence in Southeast Asia is set to increase as the U.S. and European Union significantly cut their foreign aid budgets. With the West pulling back tens of billions in funding, China is solidifying its position as the region's largest infrastructure financier, enhancing its strategic leverage. The report notes that while traditional donors combined still outspend Beijing, China is well-positioned to regain dominance in development finance. This shift is occurring as China deepens infrastructure ties, such as high-speed rail projects with Vietnam and Thailand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in the southern Syrian city of Suweida following a week of deadly clashes between local Druze fighters, Bedouin gunmen, and government forces. The fighting, which erupted over the abduction of a Druze merchant, has reportedly killed over 1,000 people and displaced more than 128,000. According to a UK-based monitor, the Bedouin tribes have withdrawn and government forces have closed roads to contain tensions. The city now faces a severe humanitarian crisis, with hospitals overwhelmed and a critical shortage of medical supplies.</p>
