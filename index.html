          <h2>Trump Insists on 'Substantial' Concessions from China to End Tariff War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated that he will not reduce tariffs on China unless they offer something 'substantial' in return, emphasizing his desire for China to open its markets to U.S. businesses and products. He expressed frustration that a previous deal, which would have allowed the U.S. to sell its goods in China, was abandoned by the Chinese. Trump suggested that he might not even pursue this open market agreement as he is unsure if China is willing to comply. This stance underscores the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries. Optimism is tempered by the lack of concrete progress and the potential for continued economic friction.</p>

Bondi dismissed accusations that the Trump administration is intimidating judges, asserting that the government is focused on protecting citizens and ensuring public safety.

          <p>Cardiff kept their United Rugby Championship play-off aspirations alive with a thrilling comeback win against Munster, ending a 12-game losing streak against Irish teams.

Tries from Gabriel Hamer-Webb, Harri Millard, and Johan Mulder, along with a penalty try, propelled Cardiff to fifth place in the standings.

This comes after the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, potentially marking a new era for crypto regulation.

          <p>The U.S. dollar is experiencing its worst performance during the first 100 days of a presidency since the Nixon era, declining approximately 9% since President Trump's return to the White House. Trump's tariff policies have prompted investors to seek assets outside the U.S., weakening the dollar and boosting other currencies and gold. Analysts suggest this shift reflects eroding trust in U.S. institutions and a change in global asset allocation trends. Concerns about a potential U.S. recession and re-accelerating inflation have also contributed to the dollar's decline.</p>

Majorities view the early months of his administration as 'chaotic' and 'scary,' with many not perceiving him as understanding their daily struggles. Trump's approval rating is at 42%, historically low for this stage in a presidency, and confidence in his handling of key issues like the economy and immigration is waning.

          <p>Microsoft's AI assistant, Copilot, is struggling to gain popularity compared to its competitors, with weekly users remaining around 20 million, while OpenAI's ChatGPT has reached as high as 400 million. Despite being integrated into Windows 11, Microsoft 365, and the Edge browser, Copilot has not seen significant user growth. Microsoft's acquisition of Mustafa Suleyman and his team from Inflection AI aims to revamp Copilot and reduce dependence on OpenAI. The initial success of ChatGPT appears to have made a lasting impact, making it challenging for Copilot to attract users.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that creatine, a common weightlifting supplement, may also be effective in treating depression. Scientists have found that creatine helps the brain convert nutrients into energy, and that poor brain metabolism could contribute to psychiatric disorders. Clinical trials have shown that creatine supplements can improve depression when used alongside antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. A recent study in India suggests creatine may be helpful even without antidepressants, offering a potentially cheaper and easier way to treat depression, though further research is needed.</p>

The absence of a chief of staff further complicates efforts to manage the Pentagon's operations, with Democrats and at least one Republican calling for Hegseth's replacement.</p>

          <p>Sellers on Amazon have raised prices on nearly 1,000 products by an average of 30% due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The price hikes affect a wide range of items, from tech accessories to women's clothing. Other e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu have also increased prices after the U.S. closed a loophole allowing duty-free imports under $800. While Trump suggests tariffs on China may fall, uncertainty persists, making it difficult for companies to plan. Economists warn that tariffs could continue to burden companies and the economy.</p>

The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, unlawfully deported to El Salvador, has sparked debate within the party, with some advocating for his due process rights while others worry about reinforcing the narrative that Democrats prioritize foreigners over Americans. The article argues that while standing up for due process is morally sound, Democrats must ensure their messaging remains disciplined and focused on Trump's economic mismanagement.</p>
