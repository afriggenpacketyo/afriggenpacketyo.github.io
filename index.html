          <h2>Astronomers Observe Earliest Signs of Rocky Planet Formation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Using the James Webb and ALMA telescopes, astronomers have for the first time directly observed the initial stages of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. The discovery provides a unique glimpse into the potential origins of our own solar system, showing silicate minerals condensing in a region analogous to our asteroid belt. This breakthrough suggests that the processes which formed Earth might be common throughout the universe, offering new opportunities to study how planetary systems are born.</p>

A high-level delegation visited Beijing to attract investment and promote higher-value exports, including pharmaceuticals and green energy technologies, beyond its traditional commodity sales. While China presents a vital alternative market, observers caution that it may not be a simple replacement for the U.S. due to trade complexities and the risk of over-dependence.

          <p>Severe rainfall across South Korea has resulted in at least 14 deaths and left 12 people missing, primarily due to landslides and flash floods in the country's southern regions. Since Wednesday, some areas have received up to 31 inches of rain, forcing thousands to evacuate and destroying homes. While the rain has subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted, the event highlights the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, which scientists attribute to climate change.</p>

Prosecutors successfully argued it was a deliberate execution, pointing to the fact she shot him twice and her story about "fan-firing" the weapon was physically improbable with the gun she used.</p>

This moral confusion, exemplified by political figures and public denial, allows for the routine targeting of civilians and perpetuates a cycle of violence, making the peaceful settlement of conflicts nearly impossible.</p>

          <h2>United States to Impose New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' on Many Foreign Visitors</h2>

          <p>The U.S. government will implement a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, starting in the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is intended to be reimbursed if the traveler complies with all visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, significant questions remain about the implementation and reimbursement process, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating the fee will generate nearly $29 billion in revenue over ten years, suggesting few refunds are expected.
