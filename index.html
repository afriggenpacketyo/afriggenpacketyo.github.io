          <p>Intel's first-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates, but the company issued disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and revealed plans to cut operational and capital expenses, including potential job cuts, to improve efficiency under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Intel's data center group saw an increase in sales, while its PC chip business experienced a decline. Tan acknowledged that while the first quarter was a positive step, the company still faces challenges in regaining market share and driving sustainable growth, particularly in competing with Nvidia in the AI chip market.

          <p>Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin proposed a neutrality pledge for party officials in primary elections, challenging activist David Hogg, a DNC vice-chair, to choose between his party role and his commitment to unseating incumbent Democrats. This proposal follows Hogg's pledge to spend $20 million to primary "ineffective" incumbents through his organization, Leaders We Deserve. The standoff highlights internal tensions within the Democratic Party as it seeks to rebuild its brand after recent electoral losses.</p>
