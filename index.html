          <p>ESPN is set to acquire NFL Network and its media assets, including the popular RedZone channel, in a landmark deal that gives the NFL a 10% equity stake in the sports network. Following the announcement, longtime RedZone host Scott Hanson confirmed he will return for the 2025 season, easing fan concerns about his future with the channel. Hanson expressed optimism about the new partnership, while the NFL will continue to produce RedZone programming from its own studios, with ESPN handling distribution.</p>

          <p>Louisiana has canceled a major $3 billion project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing coastal wetlands by diverting sediment from the Mississippi River. The project was scrapped by Governor Jeff Landry's administration following strong opposition from local fishing communities who feared it would destroy their livelihoods, despite about $600 million already being spent. Coastal scientists argue the cancellation is a significant setback, as the wetlands provide a critical buffer against hurricanes and their continued loss threatens the region's culture and long-term sustainability.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed its Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic missile (LRHW) system to Australia for the first time, marking a significant military milestone and a demonstration of its advanced capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. The land-based missile, which can travel at over 3,800 mph and strike targets 1,700 miles away, was transported by the Hawaii-based 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force. Analysts view the deployment as a strategic "flexing of military muscle" intended to strengthen defense cooperation with Australia and send a clear message to China.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given the Chinese government two weeks to clarify why plans for its new London embassy, located near the financial district, contain redacted sections. The proposed mega-embassy has sparked significant security concerns, including fears of potential espionage and risks to local residents from protests. The government, which took over the planning decision from the local council, is also questioning a Home Office request for a new "hard perimeter" around the site, with a final decision expected by September 9.</p>

          <p>A recent study by World Weather Attribution scientists concludes that climate change likely made Pakistan's recent monsoon rains 10% to 15% heavier, exacerbating deadly flooding. The report highlights that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall and increasing the country's vulnerability. This year's floods have already caused at least 300 deaths, with rapid urbanization and fragile housing in flood-prone areas compounding the disaster, echoing the catastrophic floods of 2022.</p>

          <p>A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) indicates that inner London boroughs are poised to be the biggest losers in a government plan to overhaul council funding formulas. Some boroughs could see funding drop by up to 12% once the changes, set to be phased in from 2026, are implemented. The new system aims to redirect funds to areas with more lower-band council tax properties and redistribute business rates, benefiting urban areas outside the capital and some outer London boroughs.</p>

          <p>A 62-year-old British man has been charged with attempted second-degree murder after allegedly trying to drown his 33-year-old daughter-in-law in a swimming pool while on holiday in Florida. The incident occurred at a rental home in Davenport, reportedly following an argument about his grandchildren. According to the Polk County Sheriff's Department, the man repeatedly held the woman underwater and only stopped when neighbors intervened and called the police, with the victim's nine-year-old daughter also reportedly jumping in to help her mother.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated a potential summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could happen as early as next week, following what he called "highly productive" talks between his special envoy and Russian officials in Moscow. The White House confirmed Trump is open to meeting both leaders, stating his desire to end the war. This development comes as a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face further U.S. sanctions approaches, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned that "many impediments" to a deal remain.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, UCAS, predicts a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their A-level grades. Dr. Jo Saxton stated that uncertainty around international student numbers is making UK undergraduates more valuable to universities, who see them as a source of stability for financial planning. This increased flexibility comes as universities have made more offers this year, making it a particularly favorable environment for local applicants.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani showcased his rare two-way talent, pitching four strong innings and hitting his 39th home run of the season in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Despite his impressive performance, which included a season-high eight strikeouts, the team's bullpen was unable to secure the win, giving up four runs in a 5-3 loss. The article notes that while Ohtani continues to excel on the mound, his offensive numbers have seen a dip since he resumed pitching, raising questions about the demands of being a modern two-way player.</p>

Cramer pointed to heavily-shorted stocks like Palantir and Arista Networks that surged on positive news, while companies like Disney and Honeywell struggled to gain traction despite strong fundamentals, creating a tricky environment for investors.

          <p>The number of empty homes in England is steadily increasing, with over 260,000 properties now classified as long-term empty, causing growing concern for local councils and residents. These vacant properties can become magnets for crime and decay, negatively impacting communities, as exemplified by a resident in Bristol living next to a collapsing, rat-infested house. While the country faces a housing shortage and record homelessness, charities and local authorities are calling for stronger powers to bring these wasted resources back into use.</p>

          <p>Financial markets widely anticipate that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, which would be its fifth reduction since last August and bring borrowing costs to a two-year low. A rate cut would offer some relief to homeowners with variable-rate mortgages but would mean lower returns for savers. The expected move comes despite inflation remaining above the Bank's 2% target, as signs of a cooling labor market and sluggish economic growth appear to be weighing on the decision.

While the president cannot unilaterally repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act, the move signals an escalation in his long-standing criticism of the city's governance and could be pursued through Congress.</p>

          <p>New archaeological research indicates that survivors of the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. This evidence suggests that a precarious settlement, described as a "favela among the ruins," existed at the site until the 5th century. It is believed that some survivors who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, settled in the upper floors of buried homes, salvaging valuable materials from the devastated city. This discovery changes the long-held understanding that the site was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event.</p>
