          <h2>Experts Warn Against Panic Buying Due to Tariff Impacts</h2>

          <p>Experts are cautioning U.S. consumers against rushing into debt to beat potential price increases caused by President Trump's sweeping tariffs. While some consumers are stocking up on goods to avoid higher prices, analysts advise taking a measured approach and considering long-term financial stability. They emphasize that the supply chain is in better shape than during the pandemic and that panic buying could lead to financial strain for households already carrying significant debt. Experts suggest consumers should prioritize their long-term financial goals over short-term savings from avoiding tariffs.&#x20;</p>

          <p>An Iowa family recently had a rare encounter with two deer that appeared to be albino while driving home from a birthday dinner. While it's unclear if the animals were truly albino or piebald deer, the sighting was considered an extreme rarity, potentially a 1 in 400 million chance. Piebald deer, which have varying amounts of white fur, are uncommon, occurring in less than 1% of the population. The family, who recently moved to Iowa, expressed their excitement as wildlife enthusiasts to see such unique animals off the beaten path.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a Republican "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if they trigger a recession. Cruz expressed concern that the tariffs, if sustained and met with global retaliation, could spark a trade war, harming the U.S. economy and costing jobs. While Cruz stated his desire for the administration's trade policies to succeed, he emphasized that success should involve lower tariffs abroad and at home to benefit American workers and businesses.</p>

The strike comes amid escalating conflict and evacuation orders in northern Gaza, with the UN reporting that hundreds of thousands have been displaced.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are criticizing the formula used by the Trump administration to calculate tariffs, calling it misleading and not reflective of global trade economics. President Trump claimed the tariffs were "reciprocal," based on the combined rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, and cheating by other nations, but economists say the calculations are based on dividing a nation's trade deficit with the value of its imports. Experts argue this formula does not align with modern definitions of trade deficits and is unlikely to achieve the administration's desired results.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced a significant downturn as stocks tumbled for a second consecutive day due to concerns about the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the potential for a global trade war. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw their largest one-day drops since March 2020, wiping out trillions in market value. The Nasdaq Composite entered a bear market, and economists downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth, warning that the tariffs could boost inflation and reduce consumer spending.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama called on Americans to resist President Trump's political agenda and defend democratic values, warning of potential sacrifices needed to support those values. Obama expressed concern over the administration's economic policies, including tariffs, and its threats to universities over free speech issues. He urged citizens, colleges, and law firms to stand up against actions that undermine the international order and erode respect for free speech and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic posits that Donald Trump's aggressive desire to acquire Greenland should be taken seriously, despite seeming like the stuff of a political thriller. They argue that unlike his usual floating of wild ideas, Trump means it, and his administration is taking actionable steps. They suggest his actions contravene American and international law, undermining the peace and stability of an allied nation and potentially precipitating a civil-military crisis if he directs the U.S. military to seize Greenland.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic argues that Laura Loomer's growing influence in the Trump administration is a warning sign of the president's shift further to the right. Loomer, known for her racist and extremist views, has reportedly met with Trump and influenced White House decisions. Her prominence highlights how little Trump now cares about associating with individuals who have expressed racist and bigoted ideas, marking a significant departure from his first term.</p>

          <p>China has vowed to take "resolute measures" to protect its interests against President Trump's tariffs, which it deems "suppressive." The Chinese foreign ministry condemned the tariffs as a violation of international trade rules and called on the world to oppose unilateralism and protectionism. This statement follows China's imposition of tariffs on U.S. products in response to Trump's actions, contributing to a significant decline in U.S. stock markets.</p>
