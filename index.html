          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has raised safety concerns over air traffic controllers taking second jobs, such as for Uber, to cope financially during the ongoing government shutdown. He emphasized that these essential employees are working long, high-stress shifts without pay, and the added pressure could compromise aviation safety. Duffy also cautioned the public that flight delays and cancellations are likely to increase as the shutdown continues to strain the system and cause staffing shortages, deliberately slowing traffic to maintain safety.</p>

The project's cost has risen to an estimated $300 million, financed by a list of corporate and individual donors. This development contradicts President Trump's earlier assurances that the project would not impact the existing structure, with the administration now citing structural necessity for the demolition and modernization of the historic wing.</p>

          <p>An advocacy group named Unleash Prosperity has launched a billboard campaign in New York and New Jersey to draw attention to the significant number of residents and wealth moving to Republican-led states like Florida and Texas. The group's founder, a former Trump economic advisor, attributes the migration to high taxes, crime, and dissatisfaction with public schools in the blue states. The campaign argues that this trend is not just a pandemic-era phenomenon but a decade-long pattern with the potential to increase national political polarization.</p>

          <p>On the anniversary of Hungary's 1956 anti-Soviet uprising, Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his main challenger, Peter Magyar, held large, competing rallies in Budapest. Orban framed the upcoming election as a choice between his "peace" agenda and the opposition's alleged "warmongering" in support of Ukraine and the EU. In contrast, Magyar presented himself as an anti-corruption candidate aiming to dismantle Orban's pro-Kremlin system, which he claims has made Hungary the EU's poorest and most corrupt member state.</p>

          <p>A new scientific report has concluded that a record-setting marine heat wave in 2023 caused the "functional extinction" of two critical coral species, staghorn and elkhorn, along a 350-mile stretch of Florida's reef. Researchers found that between 97.8% and 100% of these foundational "reef-builder" corals perished due to extreme and prolonged high sea surface temperatures. This means there are no longer enough of these species to perform their essential ecological roles, marking a devastating and likely permanent transformation of the Caribbean reef ecosystem.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams plans to endorse his former political rival, Andrew Cuomo, in the city's upcoming mayoral election. The endorsement positions Cuomo, a centrist, against the Democratic nominee, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. This move signals a significant reconciliation between Adams and Cuomo, who had engaged in bitter public attacks before Adams ended his own re-election campaign amid a federal corruption case that was later dismissed.</p>

          <p>Three Metropolitan Police officers have been dismissed for gross misconduct after being secretly filmed for a BBC Panorama investigation into behavior at Charing Cross police station. The officers were recorded making racist and misogynistic comments, including being dismissive of a pregnant woman's allegation of sexual assault. During expedited misconduct hearings, the panel chair described the officers' conduct as a "disgrace" and upheld the allegations, leading to their immediate dismissal from the force.</p>

          <p>Melanie Winter, a dedicated environmental activist who fought for nearly three decades to restore the natural state of the Los Angeles River, has died at age 67. As the leader of the nonprofit group The River Project, she championed a vision of removing concrete channels to create natural floodplains and green spaces that could recharge groundwater and reduce flood risks. Her work led to the creation of new riverfront parks and inspired a new generation of advocates to reimagine urban waterways.</p>

          <p>With a small number of mega-cap tech stocks representing nearly 40% of the S&P 500, investors are increasingly seeking to hedge against unprecedented market concentration risk. This has led to a surge in flows into uncorrelated assets like cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrency. Strategists note that this diversification into alternative assets is becoming a new normal as investors look for protection from volatility and acknowledge their heavy exposure to the technology sector.
