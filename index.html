          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula generated a tsunami, prompting warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast. While the most severe risks later subsided in the U.S., some coastal areas experienced minor flooding and dangerous currents. The event triggered a massive international response, with numerous Pacific and South American nations issuing alerts and closing coastal areas as a precaution. This incident highlights the far-reaching impact of major seismic events across oceanic basins.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling short of market expectations primarily due to a 93.8% collapse in its crucial chip division's profit. The company cited inventory value adjustments and the effects of China-related export restrictions as key factors for the downturn in its semiconductor business. Despite the chip struggles, Samsung's mobile division saw an increase in sales and profit, driven by strong demand for its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones. The company plans to focus on high-value AI products in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on South Korean goods, a lower rate than the previously threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for U.S. projects and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. Interpretations of the investment fund's control differ between Washington and Seoul, with South Korea emphasizing its role in helping Korean companies enter the U.S. market. The deal avoids tariffs on U.S. goods entering South Korea and exempts semiconductors from higher global rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Boring Company's plan to construct a 10-mile underground transit loop in Nashville, Tennessee, has ignited a political dispute between state and local officials. The project, supported by Republican Governor Bill Lee, is being fast-tracked with a proposed no-cost land lease, prompting concern from Nashville's Democratic lawmakers over a lack of public input, environmental review, and transparency. The proposed "Music City Loop" would connect downtown to the airport and be privately funded. This development follows community backlash against another Musk venture, xAI, in Memphis over environmental concerns.</p>

His internet search history included queries about undetectable poisons. The defense had suggested Angela's death could have been a suicide. Craig faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the conviction.</p>

          <p>Following an outcry from residents, Los Angeles city leaders have moved to block the construction of duplexes in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which is rebuilding after a devastating wildfire. The decision follows a state-level executive order exempting the high-fire-risk area from SB 9, a state law designed to increase housing density. Residents raised concerns that adding more homes would worsen evacuation dangers in future fires. The move has been criticized by pro-development groups, who argue that officials are using safety as a pretext to block a housing law they have long opposed.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution, civil rights violations, and defamation, claiming he was targeted for political or professional gain. The judge dismissed the case without prejudice due to a lack of significant action, giving Baldwin's legal team 30 days to refile. An attorney for Baldwin stated they have been in good-faith settlement discussions and characterized the dismissal as a temporary non-event while those talks continue.</p>

The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and complex task of rerouting the M25 motorway. The group claims its proposal would be cheaper, less risky, and could be fully operational by 2035, offering a distinct alternative for the UK government to consider.

While the U.S. government has seen a tripling in monthly tariff revenue, the policies have also contributed to a widening trade deficit, partly due to companies stockpiling goods. The tariffs have significantly reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., prompting China to strengthen trade with other partners like India and the EU. Economists are now observing initial signs of rising U.S. consumer prices on imported goods, suggesting the costs are beginning to be passed on to Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the recent Pacific tsunami, experts explain the science behind these powerful ocean waves. Tsunamis are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes, particularly those with significant vertical movement of the seafloor, like the recent 8.8 magnitude quake off Russia. The waves travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, which makes them so destructive. Forecasting remains challenging, but deep-ocean sensors are improving prediction accuracy, providing critical time for warnings and evacuations.</p>

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become the veteran leader, or "Yoda," of a young Los Angeles Rams secondary. At 30 years old, Witherspoon provides a calming and savvy presence for a defensive group that remains unchanged from last season. After playing for the 49ers and Steelers, he joined the Rams in 2023 and became a key starter. Now signed to a new one-year deal, he is embracing his role as a mentor, recognizing that his growth involves not just focusing on his own play but also empowering his younger teammates.</p>

          <p>Shares of Arm Holdings fell after the company's first-quarter report, where revenue slightly missed expectations and a key business segment showed weakness. While the chip designer's overall guidance for the next quarter was in line with forecasts, executives noted that royalty revenue from the smartphone sector was not as strong as anticipated. The company also confirmed it is exploring designing its own chiplets or full semiconductor solutions to provide a better starting point for customers, a strategic shift that could create competition with its current partners. This move introduces potential execution risks but aims to meet evolving customer demands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NBA player Marcus Morris Sr. has been released from a Florida jail after being arrested on felony fraud charges related to outstanding casino markers in Las Vegas. Morris was held for over two days without bail pending extradition to Nevada. His release came after a payment was made to resolve the debts owed to two casinos, which totaled over $200,000. In an Instagram post, Morris stated the "money paid back and lesson learned," but objected to being characterized as a fraud, stating the issue was about a delayed payment, not an inability or unwillingness to pay.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has launched a major recruitment campaign, appealing to patriotism and offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 to attract new deportation officers, investigators, and lawyers. The hiring push is funded by a recent congressional allocation of $76.5 billion to ICE over five years, aimed at expanding detention capacity and staff to meet a goal of one million annual deportations. The campaign recalls World War II-era posters, urging Americans to "DEFEND THE HOMELAND." Critics have raised concerns that a rapid expansion could lower hiring standards and oversight, echoing past issues with Border Patrol's growth.</p>

          <p>Canada plans to officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the third G7 nation to announce such a move recently, following France and the UK. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the recognition is contingent upon the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms and holding elections without the participation of Hamas. The policy shift was prompted by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Israel's foreign ministry criticized the announcement, calling it a "reward for Hamas" that undermines efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage release.</p>

          <p>At the request of President Trump, Texas Republicans are moving forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts five years ahead of the typical schedule. Lawmakers have released a proposed map that could give the GOP up to 30 of the state's 38 House seats, aiming to bolster the party's majority in the 2026 midterm elections. The move has prompted threats of retaliatory gerrymandering from Democratic governors in states like California and Illinois. This potential for a partisan "gerrymandering war" raises concerns about institutional damage and further eroding public faith in the political process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent 8.8 magnitude event off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly limited tsunami damage outside its immediate vicinity. Scientists explain that the tsunami's primary energy was directed into a relatively empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching heavily populated coastlines. This directionality, combined with the timing of low tides in some areas like California, meant that the U.S. West Coast was spared a catastrophic event. The outcome serves as a best-case scenario for a distant, powerful earthquake.</p>

The automaker's second-quarter revenue beat expectations, but it reported a net loss of $36 million due to special charges, including a major vehicle recall. Ford's commercial vehicle division showed strong growth, while its electric vehicle unit, Model e, continued to post significant losses. (not investment advice)</p>
