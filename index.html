          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina being vacated by Republican Thom Tillis. His planned entry into the 2026 race reportedly has the endorsement of the White House. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his candidacy for the same seat. This development follows Lara Trump's announcement that she will not be running, setting the stage for a high-profile contest in the battleground state.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, met with a senior Department of Justice official at a federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida. The meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was arranged following a directive from President Trump to release all credible evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell's attorneys stated they were looking forward to a productive day and that their client would testify truthfully. The meeting occurs as the House Oversight Committee also issued a subpoena for Maxwell to be deposed at the prison in August.</p>

          <p>McDonald's plans to test a new line of beverages, including cold brews, refreshers, and flavored sodas, at more than 500 restaurants this summer. The move aims to attract younger consumers and capitalize on the trend of flavorful, customizable drinks, a strategy influenced by its recently shuttered CosMc's spinoff. This beverage expansion is part of an effort to boost sales, which have been lackluster in recent quarters. The test will initially be limited to locations in and around Wisconsin and Colorado to gauge customer preferences and operational feasibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump is visiting the Federal Reserve headquarters, continuing his public criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The visit follows Trump's recent suggestion that Powell could be fired over the rising costs of a renovation project for the Fed's buildings, which he called "disgraceful." Trump has consistently expressed frustration with Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy. While firing Powell would challenge the Fed's long-held independence and likely unsettle markets, Trump has confirmed discussing the "concept of firing him" with lawmakers.

          <p>AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, known as "the godfather of AI," are cautioning that a simple "kill switch" will not be effective in controlling a potential superintelligent AI. Hinton argues that once AI surpasses human intelligence, its power of persuasion will be its greatest tool, making it capable of convincing humans not to shut it down. Other experts note that any built-in safety mechanisms would simply become training data for the AI to learn how to circumvent them. Extreme measures like bombing data centers are considered impractical and would cause catastrophic humanitarian crises, shifting the focus to ensuring AI is developed to be benevolent from the start.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has finalized a deal with the Trump administration that restores $400 million in federal funding in exchange for implementing new measures to combat antisemitism. The agreement, which will cost the university around $220 million in settlements, has drawn both praise and sharp criticism from faculty and students. Critics argue the deal represents capitulation to "extortion" and will stifle pro-Palestinian speech and academic freedom. Supporters, however, believe it facilitates necessary structural reforms while preserving the university's core principles, highlighting the deep divisions on campus over the issue.</p>

Reynolds said the solution involves building more homes, accelerating the processing of asylum claims, and reducing small boat crossings. The comments follow criticism of the Prime Minister for suggesting there is "lots of housing" available for homeless families, a claim disputed by local councils facing a housing crisis.</p>
