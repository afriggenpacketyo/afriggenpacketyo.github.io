          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, to bolster the economy amid trade tensions. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and the reserve requirement ratio, injecting significant liquidity into the market. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as consumption and elderly care. While analysts note these steps indicate urgency, some suggest their impact on domestic credit demand may be limited, and new fiscal policies might be needed to see concrete economic improvement.</p>

Families of victims have expressed support for the measure, viewing it as a step towards providing peace and justice. The bill also addresses disruptive behavior in court, allowing offenders facing whole life orders to be confined to their cells and stripped of privileges.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a newly-agreed trade deal with India that includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties claim this could disadvantage British workers by making Indian workers cheaper to employ. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds asserts that he would never tolerate British workers being undercut as a result of a trade agreement. The deal extends the Nics exemption from one to three years, meaning individuals on short-term visas will only make social security payments in their home country when working abroad.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has announced a roadmap to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027, but experts warn that new dependencies and internal divisions could hinder the plan. Despite a decrease in overall EU fossil fuel imports from Russia since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) have risen. The plan proposes banning new gas contracts with Russian suppliers by the end of 2025 and phasing out all remaining imports by 2027. However, some countries continue to import Russian LNG, complicating the EU's efforts to diversify energy supplies and reduce overall gas consumption.</p>

Both sides have imposed hefty, triple-digit tariffs on each other's goods, making trade between the world's two largest economies near impossible.

          <p>Minneapolis is experiencing a surge in violence, with multiple shootings resulting in fatalities and injuries, which some attribute to the "defund the police" movement. Jim Schultz, a former Minnesota attorney general nominee, argues that anti-police rhetoric and budget cuts have emboldened criminals. He criticizes the county prosecutor for implementing policies that undermine public safety, including considering race in sentencing guidelines. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office to examine whether its policies illegally consider race in prosecutorial decision-making.</p>

          <p>Bank of America reports that investors have been moving capital out of U.S. equities and into European and Japanese markets due to volatility caused by President Trump's tariffs. U.S. equities experienced significant outflows, while European and Japanese equities saw substantial inflows. The data indicates a risk-taking mood, with inflows into cryptocurrencies and high-yield bonds, and outflows from gold and U.S. Treasury bonds. This shift reflects investor concerns about the impact of trade policies on U.S. market stability.</p>

          <p>Tensions have risen again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades. India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint. Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed to a trade deal aimed at reducing barriers to trade and boosting their economies. The agreement will lower taxes on various goods imported by both countries, potentially leading to cheaper prices and more choices for consumers. It will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India. The UK government anticipates the deal will significantly increase trade volume and positively impact the UK economy, though the benefits will materialize gradually over time.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has cautioned that U.S. restrictions on sales to China will result in a $1.5 billion revenue hit this year. This warning overshadowed an otherwise optimistic outlook for the company. The guidance stems from an export restriction imposed in April that targeted AMD’s MI308 chips. CEO Lisa Su remains confident about overall demand for AI infrastructure and anticipates strong sales growth in the second half of the year with new chip releases.</p>

He also said he feared Europe was going to lose confidence in the “certainty of America and the leadership of America” and that a breakdown of US-Europe relations under Trump “would change the modern history of the world”.</p>
