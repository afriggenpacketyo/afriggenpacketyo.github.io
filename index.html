          <p>Senate Republicans are considering revisions to President Trump's budget package, which narrowly passed the House, due to disagreements over Medicaid, spending cuts, clean energy tax credits, and the state and local tax deduction. Some senators are concerned about Medicaid cuts and the impact on rural hospitals, while others want deeper spending cuts. Disagreements also exist over rolling back clean energy tax credits, with some senators supporting a stable tax framework for domestic energy development. The inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling is also facing opposition from fiscal hawks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have engaged in a public dispute over Trump's domestic megabill, with Musk criticizing the legislation and Trump expressing disappointment in Musk. Musk claimed that Trump would have lost the election without his support, while Trump suggested Musk was upset about the elimination of electric vehicle credits. Multiple administration officials have attempted to reach out to Musk, but their calls have not been returned. Musk's opposition adds to the challenges the bill faces in the Senate.</p>

Non-partisan analyses also show that taxes will not rise by 68% if the bill does not pass, and the Medicaid cuts are not solely targeting waste and fraud.</p>

Mexico had argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border resulted from deliberate practices by U.S. firms appealing to cartel members with their products.
