          <p>Russian forces conducted a large-scale overnight attack, launching approximately 30 missiles and 300 drones across Ukraine. The assault resulted in at least one fatality in the port city of Odesa and caused significant damage to critical infrastructure in Sumy, leading to power outages. While Ukraine grappled with the attacks, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed its air defense systems successfully intercepted 87 Ukrainian drones over its own territory. In a separate development, Australia confirmed it is supplying Ukraine with 49 M1A1 Abrams tanks to aid in its defense against the ongoing invasion.</p>

          <p>An outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease Chikungunya in southern China has led local authorities to implement urgent public health measures. The city of Foshan has seen over 1,100 confirmed cases, which reportedly originated from an imported case detected on July 8. In response, officials in the Shunde and Nanhai districts have urged residents to conduct thorough sanitation and clean-up efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. Health officials have stated that all recorded patients are currently experiencing only mild symptoms from the virus.</p>

          <p>The unresolved history between Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continues to create a significant political challenge for the president, particularly among his own base. For years, right-wing conspiracy theories positioned Epstein's network as a deep-state cabal of Democratic pedophiles, with Trump as the supposed avenger. However, the Justice Department's recent statement that no incriminating "client list" exists has debunked a core tenet of this belief, causing backlash from prominent MAGA figures. This article suggests that Trump's inability to control the narrative has left him haunted by Epstein's ghost, fueling internal conflict and instability within his movement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive tariff strategy is facing scrutiny as consumer prices show a renewed increase, contradicting White House claims of low inflation. Economists warn that the high tariffs, now at their highest average level since 1910, are being passed on to US consumers, contributing to rising costs. This situation has created a standoff with the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates on hold to assess the economic impact. President Trump has escalated his public criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, demanding rate cuts and raising concerns about the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is facing legal and political opposition over its demand for states to hand over the personal data of millions of SNAP recipients by July 30. The agency is requesting names, addresses, birth dates, and Social Security numbers, citing the need to ensure program integrity and verify immigration status. A federal lawsuit filed by recipients and privacy advocates argues the plan violates federal privacy laws and could turn a food assistance program into a tool for mass surveillance.

          <p>Texas has enacted the "Life of the Mother Act" to provide clarity for doctors regarding the state's abortion ban, which only permits the procedure when a patient's life or a major bodily function is at risk. The new law specifies that a patient's death does not need to be "imminent" to qualify for the exception and confirms the burden of proof rests on the state in any legal challenge against a doctor. While supporters see it as a step toward protecting physicians, critics argue it does not go far enough, as it fails to add exceptions for cases of sexual assault, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies.</p>

          <p>To curb impulsive spending and promote financial wellness, experts recommend asking a series of introspective questions before making a purchase. Financial therapist Aja Evans suggests evaluating if the purchase is an attempt to fill an emotional need, such as hunger, anger, loneliness, or tiredness. It is also crucial to consider if spending has become a pattern and whether the desire for an item is driven by a need to impress others. Additionally, Consumer Reports reporter Brian Vines advises conducting research to ensure product quality and price fairness, rather than assuming a higher price guarantees better performance.</p>

Despite the risks, the MoD stated it would "robustly defend against any legal action," citing an independent review that concluded it was "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked list.

Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise is seen by many as a sign of growing political power for communities that have historically been marginalized and subjected to surveillance. His success challenges long-held assumptions about who can represent a major American city, reflecting a broader shift in the Democratic base's priorities.</p>

          <p>Over 250 Venezuelan migrants, who were detained in a notorious El Salvador prison after being arrested in U.S. immigration raids, have been released and returned to Venezuela. Their release was part of a prisoner swap deal that also secured the freedom of ten Americans held by Venezuelan authorities. The migrants' detention was controversial, as the Trump administration claimed they were gang members but provided little evidence. Human rights groups have documented severe abuse inside the prison, and one released detainee described being beaten and held incommunicado for months while his family had no information on his whereabouts.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deceased were identified as detectives Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, all veteran members of the department's Arson Explosives Detail. Senior law enforcement officials indicated the blast may have occurred while the bomb squad was working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a separate location the previous day. The incident marks the largest single loss of life for the department since 1857, prompting a major investigation involving local and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising in Pakistan as a government official warned the sons of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan against participating in planned nationwide protests for his release. Jemima Goldsmith, Khan's ex-wife, accused the government of a "personal vendetta," claiming her sons have been threatened with arrest if they visit Pakistan. Khan's PTI party is organizing the rallies, set to begin August 5, to demand his freedom from jail, where he has been held since August 2023. Analysts are skeptical that Khan's sons, who live in the UK, could catalyze the movement, which faces a government preparing a new national paramilitary force.</p>

          <p>China's top market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), has summoned major e-commerce and delivery companies, including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com, over an intensifying price war. The meeting was intended to enforce regulations, encourage rational competition, and protect the interests of consumers, merchants, and delivery riders. The SAMR instructed the companies to adhere to all relevant laws, including those concerning anti-unfair competition and food safety. This move reflects Beijing's ongoing efforts to assert greater control over the country's powerful technology sector and ensure stable market practices.</p>

          <p>Italy is facing a deepening demographic crisis as its birth rate has fallen for 16 consecutive years, reaching a historic low of just 1.18 babies per woman. This trend is causing towns like Fregona in northern Italy to empty out, with shrinking populations threatening the viability of local services like primary schools. Despite government initiatives such as cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient to offset the challenges of high childcare costs and job insecurity. Experts suggest that more substantial structural changes, including increased immigration and better public services, are needed to address the long-term economic strain.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his second start since returning from the injured list, though the team ultimately lost 2-0 to the Milwaukee Brewers. Glasnow pitched six innings, allowing only one run while striking out six, showcasing increased fastball velocity and a more athletic, less mechanical approach on the mound. This outing is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on the high-priced pitcher to bolster their rotation for the second half of the season. Despite Glasnow's solid start, the Dodgers' offense was stifled by Brewers pitcher Quinn Priester, who recorded ten strikeouts.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China next week. The hearing will focus on strategies for countering what is described as China's "economic coercion against democracies." During Morrison's term, relations between Australia and China deteriorated significantly after his government called for an investigation into the origins of COVID-19, leading Beijing to impose tariffs on numerous Australian commodities. His testimony comes as his successor, Anthony Albanese, concludes a visit to China aimed at warming diplomatic and trade ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The legislation is a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clear rules to legitimize the technology for payments and finance. Proponents, including the Treasury Secretary, argue the law will reinforce the dollar's global status and expand its accessibility. However, critics express concern that the law lacks strong anti-money laundering provisions and could make the U.S. financial system vulnerable to exploitation by criminals.

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and its parent companies over an article detailing his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The report described a sexually suggestive birthday letter allegedly sent by Trump to Epstein in 2003, which Trump vehemently denies writing. The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration faces mounting pressure, even from its own supporters, to be more transparent about the Epstein case. In a related move, the Department of Justice has filed a motion to unseal grand jury transcripts pertaining to the Epstein investigation.</p>
