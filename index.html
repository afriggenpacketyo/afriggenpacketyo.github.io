          <p>Walmart has initiated a recall of specific frozen shrimp products across 13 U.S. states after a shipment from an Indonesian supplier tested positive for Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed that while the single positive sample did not enter U.S. commerce, the recall is a precautionary measure to ensure consumer safety and public health. Consumers are strongly advised to dispose of or return any recently purchased affected products for a full refund, as the company prioritizes customer well-being. This proactive step aims to mitigate any potential long-term health risks, as prolonged exposure to Cesium-137 could elevate cancer risks by damaging living cells, underscoring the importance of rigorous food safety and supply chain vigilance.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm but is still projected to move up the Atlantic Ocean, threatening the U.S. East Coast with dangerous rip currents and high waves. While the storm is not expected to make direct landfall, coastal flooding and mandatory evacuations have been ordered for North Carolina's Outer Banks, highlighting the immediate dangers. Officials warn that ocean conditions will be unsafe for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast, urging the public to heed local warnings and avoid the water. The storm's large size means its effects, including life-threatening surf, will be felt widely, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 20:44:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports plummeted by 2.6% year-over-year in July, marking their steepest drop since February 2021 and exceeding forecasts for a milder contraction. This significant decline was primarily driven by reduced shipments to its two largest markets, the United States and mainland China, impacting key sectors like auto exports. The weak trade data emerged despite stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter, which was previously boosted by a catch-up in automobile shipments. Analysts are now warning of a potential economic recession, particularly due to the anticipated impact of new U.S. tariffs on automobiles, signaling ongoing challenges for Japan's export-reliant economy.

          <p>The UK Space Agency is set to lose its independent status and will be absorbed into the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) by April 2026. This move is part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's commitment to reduce bureaucracy and cut costs by streamlining government bodies. While officials claim it will improve integration and focus, critics, including a leading space scientist, fear it will disrupt the sector and cause the UK to fall behind international competitors. The agency, credited with significant advancements in the UK's space industry, generates an estimated £18.6 billion annually and employs 55,000 people.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the entire southern border wall with Mexico will be painted black, a strategy directly proposed by President Trump. The primary aim of this initiative is to make the metal hotter in high temperatures, thereby making it more difficult for individuals to climb and serving as a deterrent to illegal immigration. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks also noted that the paint would help deter rust, extending the wall's lifespan and maintaining its structural integrity. This plan is part of a broader administration effort to secure the border, funded by recent congressional allocations, despite a reported plummet in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an Afghan man mistakenly deported and then brought back to the U.S. to face smuggling charges, have requested a federal judge dismiss his indictment. They argue the Trump administration's prosecution is "vindictive and selective," retaliating against him for challenging his initial deportation. Abrego Garcia, who had legal protection, was held in a notorious El Salvadoran prison where he claims he was beaten. His defense highlights that the charges only emerged after his widely publicized deportation, suggesting a punitive response rather than a legitimate criminal pursuit, raising questions about due process.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley is witnessing a new trend where major tech companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are acquiring AI talent and intellectual property through high-priced licensing deals, rather than full acquisitions. This practice, seen as a workaround to regulatory scrutiny, often results in significant payouts for founders and top researchers but leaves the remaining company "hollowed out" and in limbo, effectively becoming a "zombie startup." Venture investors are concerned this trend disrupts the traditional path to IPOs or lucrative acquisitions, threatening innovation as talent is siphoned off by industry giants. The deals raise questions about market competition and the future of independent AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

This transformation has shifted the area's focus to outdoor tourism, including whitewater rafting, rock climbing, and zip-lining, providing new opportunities for residents.

Israel retaliated by revoking visas for Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority. This dispute highlights a growing international divide over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its humanitarian consequences, with Australia joining other nations in recognizing a Palestinian state and criticizing Israel's actions in the ongoing conflict.</p>

This article explores why these properties are not being utilized to alleviate the housing deficit, highlighting factors such as lengthy probate processes and difficulties in tracking down owners. Previous government programs successfully reduced empty homes, but their termination in 2016 shifted responsibility to local councils, leading to varied and often ineffective approaches.

          <p>President Donald Trump sparked widespread online mockery after criticizing the Smithsonian Institution for its focus on "how bad Slavery was" and discussing "how horrible our Country is," instead of highlighting "Success" or "Brightness." In a Truth Social post, Trump lashed out at American museums, deeming them "OUT OF CONTROL" for promoting what he termed "divisive ideology." This is not the first time Trump has targeted the Smithsonian over its content, having previously issued an executive order on similar grounds. Critics quickly condemned his comments, asserting that accurate historical representation, including the realities of slavery, is crucial.</p>

Wu asserted that Boston follows the law and criticized the administration for "attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures."

This incident marks one of several Ukrainian assaults on Russian-held territory, with a previous attack in June affecting over 700,000 residents for more than 24 hours. While the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe's largest, remained unaffected, the ongoing conflict continues to disrupt essential services and pose risks to civilian infrastructure in the contested region.</p>

Betts, a six-time Gold Glove winner in right field, has played shortstop full-time this season, a more mentally taxing position that has coincided with a career-low in his offensive performance.
