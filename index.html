          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service is considering further charges against former neonatal nurse Lucy Letby, who is already serving multiple life sentences for murdering seven babies. Cheshire Police have submitted a full file of evidence concerning additional deaths and collapses at hospitals where she worked, including Liverpool Women's Hospital. This investigation, known as Operation Hummingbird, covers incidents dating back to 2012. The potential new charges are separate from the recent arrests of former hospital managers for gross negligence manslaughter.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has swiftly rejected the Dalai Lama's recently announced succession plan, stating that the process must adhere to Chinese law and religious traditions. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader declared that his reincarnation will be determined solely by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a body he established. Beijing countered that any successor must be recognized through a process involving the "golden urn" and approval from the central government. This disagreement signals rising tensions over the future of Tibetan spiritual leadership.</p>

          <p>According to former President Donald Trump, Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, with a formal proposal to be delivered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, its foreign minister indicated majority government support for a hostage release framework. A Hamas official stated the group is prepared to agree if the proposal leads to a complete end to the war.

          <p>Amazon has deployed its one-millionth robot and announced a new generative AI model, "DeepFleet," to optimize its robotic fleet's efficiency in fulfillment centers. The company states that these robots work alongside human employees, handling repetitive tasks and creating new technical roles. However, this expansion comes as Amazon and other tech firms reduce their workforce, raising concerns about job displacement due to automation. CEO Andy Jassy has acknowledged that while AI will create new jobs, it will also automate others, likely leading to a smaller overall workforce in the coming years.</p>

          <p>After narrowly passing the Senate, Donald Trump's major tax and spending bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is now before the House of Representatives. The legislation, which aims to make Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent, faces resistance from factions within the Republican party. Key sticking points include its projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit and the depth of cuts to social programs like Medicaid. Conservative groups like the House Freedom Caucus have threatened to block the bill over fiscal concerns, creating uncertainty about its passage before the president's July 4th deadline.

          <p>This opinion article praises former President Donald Trump for successfully pushing European NATO allies to commit to spending 5% of their GDP on defense, a significant increase. However, the author argues this achievement will be meaningless unless the U.S. rapidly accelerates its own arms production to counter the rearming of Russia and the strategic threat from China. The piece suggests that to truly secure the alliance, the Trump administration must expedite the delivery of new Abrams tanks, fix the Patriot missile shortage, and reform the bureaucratic arms export process.</p>

          <p>A commentary in a Chinese state-affiliated newspaper suggests that China's military is drawing key lessons from recent regional conflicts, emphasizing the superiority of integrated combat systems over individual weapon performance. The article, without naming a specific conflict, described a scenario where a seemingly weaker force used a coordinated system of data links, early warning aircraft, and air defense to defeat an opponent with a disjointed collection of weapons. This indicates a strategic shift in Chinese military doctrine towards prioritizing systemic and networked operational capabilities for modern warfare.</p>

His housing plan includes a rent freeze, which aims to prevent displacement and ensure residents are not priced out by the costs of green building upgrades.

          <p>A veterinarian in Wisconsin successfully saved a severely injured bald eagle by using an innovative procedure involving a fish skin graft. The eagle, named Kere, was found with a deep leg infection, and euthanasia was initially considered the only option. Dr. Kimberly Ammann used sterilized cod skin, provided by the company Kerecis, to repair the wound, a technique more common in human medicine. After a 10-month rehabilitation, the eagle was successfully released back into the wild just before the Fourth of July, a symbolic moment for America's national bird.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Supreme Court's 2025 term concludes that its major beneficiaries were social and religious conservatives, as well as former President Donald Trump. The court issued rulings that burdened public schools with religious opt-outs, weakened federal Medicaid law, and handed a defeat to transgender rights. Concurrently, the justices frequently used the "shadow docket" to reinstate Trump administration policies that had been blocked by lower courts. The article notes that while the cultural right saw significant gains, the Republican party's traditional business and fiscal conservative wings had a less successful term.</p>

The power failure led to thousands of canceled flights and stranded passengers, costing airlines an estimated Â£80-Â£100 million.

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump concerning a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that CBS, a Paramount subsidiary, deceptively edited the interview to favor the Democratic party. While the company is not issuing an apology, the settlement money, which includes legal fees, will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library. The agreement also requires '60 Minutes' to release transcripts of interviews with future presidential candidates, marking another instance of a media company settling with the former president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While both are forms of digital money, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) like China's digital yuan have fundamental differences. The digital yuan is a state-issued currency, controlled by China's central bank and intended primarily for domestic retail payments. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued cryptocurrency tokens, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar and backed by reserve assets held by the issuer. This distinction in control, purpose, and underlying technology is central to the global debate over the future of digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a recent groundbreaking ceremony, significant questions remain about whether the Oakland Athletics' planned stadium on the Las Vegas Strip will be built. Team owner John Fisher has yet to secure the full funding for the project, whose cost has already risen to at least $1.75 billion and could reach $2 billion. Critics point out that Fisher has a large funding gap to fill even after accounting for public subsidies and a loan, and he faces rising construction costs. The complex and financially questionable saga has led many sports industry analysts to be skeptical about the project's eventual completion.</p>

The word itself is derived from the TaÃ­no term "barabicu," which described the wooden frame used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century and adapted the word into "barbacoa," which was first documented in print in 1526. Over centuries, this cooking style transformed and diversified as it spread through the U.S., influenced by various immigrant cultures to create the many regional varieties known today.</p>
