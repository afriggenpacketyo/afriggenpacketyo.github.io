          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Kilmar Ábrego García, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, were returned to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.  Noem defended the administration's actions, despite a unanimous Supreme Court order to facilitate Ábrego García's return and accusations of bad faith.  The article highlights the ongoing legal battle and the administration's repeated characterization of Ábrego García as a gang member, despite lacking criminal record.</p>
