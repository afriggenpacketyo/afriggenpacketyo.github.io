            <p>Swedish rookie Ingrid Lindblad secured her first LPGA victory at the JM Eagle LA Championship, finishing one stroke ahead of Japan's Akie Iwai. Iwai, an LPGA rookie herself, missed a crucial putt on the final hole, preventing a playoff opportunity. Fellow Japanese golfer Miyu Yamashita tied for third, while Nasa Hataoka finished sixth after a strong final round surge. Iwai expressed frustration with her performance on the final hole but remains optimistic about future tournaments.</p>

            <p>An industry expert suggests that tariffs may incentivize consumers to explore the secondhand clothing market. This shift could occur as new clothing becomes more expensive due to increased import taxes. The expert did not provide any investment advice, but rather made a statement regarding consumer behavior in response to tariffs. The secondhand clothing market may see growth as consumers seek affordable alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

This warning comes as the Trump administration reportedly plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure US partners to limit their dealings with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that China will not accept any deals made at its expense and will resolutely take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry also cautioned about the risk to all countries once international trade returns to the "law of the jungle."</p>

            <p>Shohei Ohtani rejoined the Los Angeles Dodgers lineup after taking time off for the birth of his daughter, going 0-for-3 with a walk in a 1-0 win against the Texas Rangers. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts speculated that Ohtani may have been overly aggressive at the plate after his leave. Ohtani announced the birth of his daughter, his first child with wife Mamiko, via Instagram on Saturday. Roberts joked about Ohtani's 'dad strength' potentially leading to even harder hits.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines landed back at Boeing's US production hub due to tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. Trump's tariffs have raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to impose a 125% tariff on US goods. This makes the delivery of a Boeing jet economically unviable, given a new 737 MAX's market value of around $55m. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airlines deferring deliveries rather than paying duties.</p>
