        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Olympic fencer Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of a doping allegation after a sports tribunal accepted her defense of contamination through kissing. Thibus tested positive for the anabolic substance ostarine in January 2024 but argued it came from her partner, American fencer Race Imboden, who was using a product containing the substance. The Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency, citing scientific evidence that ostarine could be transferred via saliva. This ruling allows Thibus, a silver medalist, to continue her career without a potentially career-ending ban.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon officials have adjusted the electronic line-calling system to prevent future human errors after a controversial incident during a fourth-round match. The change removes the ability for Hawk-Eye operators to manually deactivate the ball-tracking technology. The issue occurred when the system was mistakenly turned off for a game, leading to a missed call that prompted umpire Nico Helwerth to replay a crucial point. While the All England Club supported the umpire's decision, the incident has sparked debate about introducing a video review system similar to those used in other major tournaments.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced he would impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The threat was posted on Truth Social as the BRICS summit, a forum for major developing economies, was underway. The group's leaders had issued a joint statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures, seen as a swipe at Trump's tariff strategies. The policy did not specify which BRICS policies are considered anti-American, creating uncertainty about how such alignment would be assessed by the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics from both progressive and Republican sides question the involvement of an architect of what they describe as a failed foreign policy. Sullivan's tenure included the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal and policies on Ukraine and the Middle East that drew fire. While some Democrats defend him as a unifying figure, others argue the party needs fresh perspectives to redefine its platform ahead of the 2028 election, rather than relying on established insiders.</p>

          <p>New data from the National Weather Service explains the catastrophic flooding in Texas, revealing that over 20 inches of rain fell in some areas over the holiday weekend. The deluge, fueled by remnant moisture from a tropical storm, caused the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The Texas Hill Country's dry, packed soil contributed to the rapid runoff, overwhelming the river's forks and leading to the disaster.

          <p>An investigation into impeached former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has reportedly uncovered evidence that he ordered military drone flights over Pyongyang. Prosecutors allegedly have audio recordings of Yoon ordering the incursions in October 2024. Analysts suggest the move was intended to provoke a military reaction from North Korea, which could have been used to justify Yoon's subsequent declaration of martial law in December. The plan failed when North Korea protested but did not retaliate militarily. Yoon is already facing criminal charges for insurrection over the martial law decree.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has recorded over 1,277 measles cases this year, marking the most severe outbreak since 1992 and resulting in the first measles-related deaths in a decade. The spread is attributed to declining vaccination rates among children, creating new risks as summer camps and family travel increase transmission opportunities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging summer camps to verify the vaccination status of attendees. Health experts emphasize that the MMR vaccine is highly effective and the best defense against the dangerous virus, which can cause severe complications like pneumonia and encephalitis.</p>

Competing with what was effectively a B-team, the USMNT rediscovered its intensity and fight, with several younger, less-proven players making a strong case for future roster spots. The performance of players like Malik Tillman and Diego Luna has created new competition for established stars. While Mexico remains the top team in the region, the US team's growth and competitive spirit against a full-strength Mexican squad suggest a positive trajectory.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized a Department of Justice memo which concluded there was "no credible evidence" of a "client list" used by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to blackmail prominent individuals. Calling the finding "the final straw," Musk used social media to mock the Trump administration's handling of the case. The DOJ/FBI memo also reaffirmed that Epstein died by suicide and stated that no further investigations into third parties would be launched. Musk's comments represent an escalation in his public feud with the administration since his departure from a White House advisory role.</p>

Navarro stated that Cook has been asking for more time to shift production since the first Trump term, calling it the "longest-running soap opera in Silicon Valley." The criticism comes as the Trump administration continues to pressure Apple to move iPhone production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs. Analysts maintain that a complete relocation of the complex iPhone supply chain to the United States would be practically impossible. (not investment advice)</p>

HTS, led by the new Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, severed its ties with al-Qaeda years ago and played a key role in the offensive that overthrew the Assad regime.

Apple argues that the EU is mandating confusing business terms that are bad for both developers and users.
