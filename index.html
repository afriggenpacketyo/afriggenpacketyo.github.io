          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released 33,295 pages of documents from the Department of Justice related to Jeffrey Epstein. While the committee leadership touts this as a major step towards transparency, Democratic members have pointed out that approximately 97% of the material was already public. The newly disclosed information reportedly includes less than 1,000 pages of flight logs for Epstein's private plane from 2000 to 2014. Following a meeting with victims, Committee Chairman James Comer stated his intention to broaden the investigation to ensure accountability for Epstein's crimes and his network of associates.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has found rapper Cardi B not liable in a $24 million assault lawsuit brought against her by a former security guard. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, alleged that the artist spat on her and cut her with a fingernail during a 2018 confrontation at a Beverly Hills medical building, causing physical and emotional harm. Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, testified that Ellis had been filming her and invading her privacy after she requested space. The jury sided with the rapper, clearing her of all claims and any financial damages in the case.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that its deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines in Los Angeles for law enforcement purposes was a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic policing. The judge's opinion stated that the administration knowingly circumvented the law by claiming a broad "constitutional exception" to protect federal functions, an argument the court found to be without legal or historical basis. This ruling blocks further such deployments in California and highlights concerns about the administration's expansive view of presidential power.</p>

          <p>Cities across the world, including Mexico City and various locations in Spain, are experiencing a surge in protests against "overtourism," with residents expressing anger over rising costs and strained infrastructure. Demonstrators have been seen with signs like "Gringos leave" and have engaged in acts such as damaging property and blocking tourist areas. Experts note that the pandemic offered a brief respite, but the return of tourism to pre-pandemic levels has intensified local frustrations. While these protests raise awareness, their long-term effectiveness is debated, with many calling for better policy solutions like managed tourism and community involvement in planning.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly opposed President Trump's announcement of plans to send federal agents and potentially National Guard troops to Chicago. Pritzker labeled the president's remarks as "unhinged" and stated he would not request such assistance, expressing concern that the administration would use the deployment to "raid Latino communities." The governor believes the administration is staging forces from agencies like ICE and Customs and Border Patrol, similar to recent controversial deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

          <p>President Donald Trump has confirmed that the U.S. military conducted a strike in the southern Caribbean, destroying a vessel he claimed was transporting narcotics from Venezuela. In a social media post, Trump stated the operation killed 11 "Narcoterrorists" affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and released a video of the strike. The action represents a significant escalation in the Trump administration's confrontational stance toward Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of leading a drug cartel. The move follows the recent deployment of U.S. warships to the region, which Maduro has condemned as a threat of intervention.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old Houston man, Gonzalo Leon Jr., has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting and killing an 11-year-old boy, Julian Guzman. The child was reportedly participating in a "ding-dong ditch" prank, ringing doorbells and running away, when he was shot on Saturday. According to police, Guzman was running from a house just before the incident occurred, and authorities stated there was no evidence to suggest the shooting was an act of self-defense. The suspect was initially detained and released but was later arrested by a SWAT team and booked into the Harris County Jail.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has won the leadership of the Green Party of England and Wales in a landslide, signaling a potential realignment within UK left-wing politics. His blunt, digitally-savvy style presents a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other figures on its left flank like Jeremy Corbyn. Polanski's victory raises questions about the Green Party's future direction, as it may shift away from the broader coalition that recently won it seats in both urban and rural conservative areas. The development could lead to either collaboration or competition among various left-leaning factions as they vie for the same voter base.</p>

          <p>President Trump has recently claimed credit for ending six or seven wars, suggesting he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for these efforts. A White House official identified conflicts involving Israel-Iran, Rwanda-DRC, and India-Pakistan, among others. However, foreign policy experts note that while the administration has helped broker some ceasefires and agreements, several of these situations were not full-scale wars, and many of the underlying disputes remain unresolved. For instance, tensions between Israel and Iran persist, and violence has continued between Rwanda and the DRC despite a peace deal. The analysis suggests the president's claims of settled wars are premature or exaggerated.</p>

          <p>The annual Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert was marked by several strange and serious events, including a homicide investigation and a surprise birth. Authorities are investigating the death of a man found in a pool of blood at a campsite, with no arrests made yet. In a more positive turn, a woman who was unaware she was pregnant gave birth to a baby girl at the event with the help of other festival-goers who were medical professionals. The festival also faced a major dust storm that caused injuries and damage, and drew online commentary from former attendee Nicole Shanahan, who questioned if the event was demonic.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle this week. Initially, the vehicles will be operated manually by human safety drivers to validate the technology and map the new environments before any transition to fully autonomous services. This expansion follows the company's successful commercial launches of its driverless ride-hailing service in cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin. The test fleets in both new cities will consist of a mix of all-electric Jaguar I-PACE and Geely Zeekr vehicles, as Waymo continues its push to scale its robotaxi operations nationwide.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to introduce a new law in England that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The ban would apply to all retail points, including shops, cafes, vending machines, and online sales. This move addresses growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative health impacts of these drinks on children, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. While many supermarkets already have a voluntary ban, this legislation would make the restriction mandatory, though it would not affect lower-caffeine soft drinks, tea, or coffee.</p>

Lowell has a long and prominent career defending high-profile clients from both political parties, including Hunter Biden, Jared Kushner, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Known for challenging government overreach regardless of the administration in power, Lowell has framed the case against Cook as another instance of the Trump administration weaponizing federal agencies for political retribution.

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged a tow truck driver with theft of government property for allegedly driving off with a federal agent's vehicle during the arrest of a TikTok influencer in Los Angeles. The incident occurred as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were arresting Tatiana Mafla-Martinez, whose arrest was captured on a viral livestream. Authorities claim the driver, Bobby Nunez, interfered with the arrest, hooked up the agent's unoccupied vehicle, and drove away while laughing and recording the pursuing officer. The government vehicle contained a firearm locked in a safe at the time of the theft.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a federal judge has ordered Google to implement significant changes to its search business but stopped short of the harshest penalties sought by the Department of Justice. Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google must end its exclusive contracts that make it the default search engine on many devices and must share some of its search data with competitors. However, the judge rejected the DOJ's demand to force Google to sell its popular Chrome web browser, calling such a divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." The decision aims to restore competition while avoiding a dramatic breakup of the tech giant.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has authorized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to use Graphite, a powerful spyware tool developed by the Israeli-founded company Paragon. The software can hack into mobile phones and access encrypted applications like Signal and WhatsApp. A contract for the technology was initially put on hold by the Biden administration pending a compliance review, but that pause has now been lifted. Civil liberties advocates have expressed alarm, warning that providing such an invasive surveillance tool to an agency like ICE poses profound threats to privacy and free speech, especially given the spyware's history of being used against journalists and activists globally.</p>

          <p>Air Lease Corp., a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo and asset managers Apollo and Brookfield. The acquisition, valued at about $28.2 billion including debt, reflects a continuing trend of consolidation within the aircraft leasing industry. The sector has benefited from a shortage of new aircraft, which has pushed rental rates to record highs. This deal will significantly expand the scale of the acquiring companies in a market where lessors own over half of the world's passenger jets. (not investment advice)</p>

The fatal confrontation occurred after Serbeck went to Hannah's home to confront Hannah's 17-year-old son for allegedly assaulting his daughter. Prosecutors allege that both Hannah and his son struck Serbeck with a metal bat and a large flashlight during the brawl. Serbeck's family described his final act as an attempt to protect his daughter. The grand jury declined to indict Hannah on murder charges, opting for the lesser charge of manslaughter instead.</p>
