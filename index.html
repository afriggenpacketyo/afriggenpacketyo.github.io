          <p>The first group of 49 white South Africans, granted refugee status by the US, arrived after President Trump's claims of "racial discrimination" against the Afrikaner minority. South Africa disputes these allegations, stating they don't meet international refugee law thresholds. Tensions between the US and South Africa have risen, with the US criticizing South African land policies and accusing the government of seizing land from white farmers without compensation. The US has also criticized South Africa's stance against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Max du Preez called the claims of persecution a "total absurdity".</p>

Alexander, a New Jersey native serving in the Israel Defense Forces, was captured from his base near the Gaza frontier. Israeli security officials implemented a temporary pause in combat in the release area. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his assistance and instructed a delegation to negotiate in Doha, while Hamas described the release as part of ceasefire efforts, but the U.S. did not secure the remains of the four dead American hostages.</p>

          <p>Stock market futures experienced a significant surge after the U.S. and China agreed to suspend steep tariffs for 90 days, signaling a truce in their trade war. The U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese imports to 30%, while China lowered tariffs on American goods to 10%. This agreement followed negotiations in Switzerland involving U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese negotiators. While analysts view this as a positive surprise, some caution that uncertainties remain regarding the long-term resolution of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan after days of missile and drone strikes, both countries are experiencing shifts in domestic support for their respective governments. In Pakistan, the military's image has been bolstered after initially facing criticism, while in India, Prime Minister Modi's image as a strong leader is reinforced. However, experts caution that the conflict will likely lead to further restrictions on civil rights and economic strain for the common people in both countries. The ceasefire was brokered by the U.S. amidst heightened nationalistic fervor on both sides.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order seeking to lower U.S. drug prices by aligning them with lower prices in other countries, a move praised by some but criticized by the pharmaceutical industry. The order targets nations with greater negotiating power over drug prices and aims to cut out middlemen, allowing patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at "most favored nation" prices. The policy could help patients by lowering prescription medication costs, but the industry argues it could hurt profits and research. HHS Secretary Robert F.

This action undermines Trump's dominance theater and challenges his negotiating tactics. Other entities, such as Columbia University and the pharmaceutical lobby, have found that submission to Trump's demands often leads to further exploitation, while defiance can sometimes yield better results. The article suggests that Trump's behavior is driven by a need for submission rather than a genuine desire for positive-sum engagement.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields increased following the U.S. and China's agreement to reduce tariffs, signaling investor optimism about avoiding a recession. The 10-year Treasury yield rose by 5.8 basis points to 4.431%, while the 2-year Treasury yield jumped more than 10 basis points to 3.983%. Economists had been concerned that high tariffs could push the U.S. and the global economy into a recession. The likelihood of a near-term rate cut from the Federal Reserve has also decreased as the U.S. potentially avoids a recession.</p>
