          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the more than $500 million penalty imposed on Donald Trump and other defendants in his civil business fraud case. The court ruled the monetary penalty was an "excessive fine" that violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, though it upheld the non-monetary injunctive relief. The case, brought by NY Attorney General Letitia James, found Trump had significantly overvalued his assets on financial statements. Both sides have the option to appeal this new decision to a higher court.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has indicated it will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. A letter from a DOJ attorney urged Fed Chair Jerome Powell to fire Cook, an action Powell does not have the authority to take, as Fed governors can only be removed by the president. The allegations and the specific nature of the investigation have not been detailed. This development introduces significant political pressure on the Federal Reserve's leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are advancing legislation to create a new, more partisan congressional map designed to counter a similar Republican-led effort in Texas. The proposal aims to turn five GOP-held districts into Democratic-leaning ones, directly responding to Texas's new map which favors Republicans. This move is part of a broader national struggle for control of the House of Representatives, with both parties engaging in mid-decade redistricting to gain a political advantage. The effort has drawn support from former President Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, a woman sentenced to 31 months in prison for inciting racial hatred on social media following a stabbing attack in Southport, has been released. Her post called for mass deportations and setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers. Her release has intensified a debate in the UK over free speech and the severity of her sentence, with critics like Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch arguing it was disproportionate compared to punishments for physical rioting. Proponents of the sentence maintain the importance of prosecuting incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the growing "revisionist" narrative that pandemic-era restrictions like lockdowns and mask mandates were known to be ineffective and harmful from the start. It pushes back against recent books arguing this point, stating that the pre-pandemic consensus actually supported such non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce viral transmission. The author contends that while mistakes were made, particularly with prolonged school closures, the revisionist view dangerously overcorrects and could undermine public health responses to future pandemics by promoting nihilism about sensible protective measures.</p>

          <p>While certificate of deposit (CD) yields have slightly decreased from their 2023 peaks, they remain historically high, offering a stable investment option in the current inflationary environment. This article outlines the potential interest earnings on a $25,000 deposit across various CD terms, from three months to five years. For example, a one-year CD at 4.30% could earn approximately $1,075, while a five-year CD at 4.20% could generate about $5,250. CDs provide fixed rates, protecting savers from market volatility and offering predictable returns. (not investment advice)</p>

Through intimate portraits and interviews with 14 individuals and couples in Los Angeles, the project reveals that this life stage is not a singular experience of loss. Instead, it is a period of profound transition marked by a mixture of grief, relief, loneliness, and newfound freedom. The stories illustrate how parents are rediscovering their identities, navigating new relationship dynamics, and reimagining their lives and homes in this mutable phase.</p>

          <p>A recent fundraiser for FarmKind, an organization supporting anti-factory farming charities, has popularized the idea of "moral offsetting" for meat-eaters. The concept, likened to carbon offsets, suggests that individuals who feel guilty about eating meat but are unwilling to go vegan can donate money to effectively reduce animal suffering elsewhere in the food system. While this pragmatic approach has raised millions and offers a new way for people to engage, it also sparks an ethical debate about whether it absolves personal responsibility and adequately addresses the core issues of factory farming.</p>

In states served by grid operator PJM Interconnection, residents have seen dramatic increases, with some New Jersey customers facing a 17-20% rise in their monthly bills. While President Trump had promised to slash prices, the current surge is causing voter frustration, with polls showing blame being cast on utility companies and politicians. This affordability crisis is expected to heavily influence upcoming races. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 61% of U.S. college students believe they will be personally affected by the changes to federal student loans set to begin in July 2026 under a new bill signed by President Trump. The legislation introduces new borrowing caps, eliminates Grad Plus loans, and reduces the number of available repayment plans. In response, a significant number of students are reconsidering their educational paths, with many contemplating reducing their course load, changing majors, or even forgoing graduate school due to the anticipated financial strain.</p>

          <h2>New Study Questions the Effectiveness of Wolf Hunting in Protecting Livestock</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study analyzing data from four Western U.S. states suggests that public wolf hunting has a negligible impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers found that killing one wolf saved only about 7% of a single cow, meaning roughly 14 wolves would need to be hunted to prevent one cow's death. The findings challenge a key justification for regulated wolf hunts in states like Montana and Idaho. The study's authors suggest that if the primary goal is to reduce livestock predation, hunting may not be the most effective management tool.</p>

She also spoke out against the stigma associated with these popular drugs, stating that using them is not "the easy way out" but rather a form of self-care that requires courage.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with Kremlin thinking, Russian President Vladimir Putin's current peace proposal demands that Ukraine completely cede the remainder of the eastern Donbas region. In a potential compromise from previous demands, Moscow would halt front lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson rather than demanding the entire territories. The proposal also requires Ukraine to renounce NATO ambitions, remain neutral, and prohibit any Western troops on its soil. These terms remain far from what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated is acceptable for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Donald Trump's main objective in brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is the personal prestige of winning a Nobel Peace Prize. This motivation, the article contends, makes a complete "sellout" of Ukraine unlikely, as any deal would require the willing participation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders to be seen as legitimate by the Nobel committee. The author suggests Trump has weakened his own leverage through unilateral concessions to Russia, while underestimating the coherence of European leaders and Ukraine's own agency in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has reportedly won the race to sign England international and Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze, making a late bid after rivals Tottenham Hotspur had already agreed to terms. The move was allegedly prompted by a potential knee injury to Arsenal's Kai Havertz, leading the club to act on its long-standing interest. Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan who was in their academy, reportedly favored the move to the Emirates Stadium. The transfer is seen as a major coup for Arsenal, strengthening their attack with a creative player capable of breaking down defenses.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as an act of terror with "no military logic," noting its timing just days after peace talks between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.
