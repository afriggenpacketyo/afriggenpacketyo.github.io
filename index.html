          <p>President Trump has delayed his threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US following a conversation with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen announced a tariff delay to July 9, providing more time for negotiations.

This delay aims to allow both sides to reach a new trade agreement and de-escalate tensions between the US and EU.</p>

The increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems, which rely on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback. The majority of fake reviews fall into the categories of boosting and member fraud, while paid reviews are a smaller but more pernicious issue.

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner in China, has advocated for lowering the country's annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years. This adjustment accounts for the potential of a prolonged rivalry with the United States and the necessity to address deep-seated structural issues within China. Xu emphasized that achieving 4% annual GDP growth would be beneficial if it leads to expanded employment and controlled debt ratios. He believes it's inappropriate to set a higher target considering the complex international environment and domestic difficulties like property issues and weak market confidence.

          <p>An American expatriate living in Spain reflects on her decision to leave the U.S. due to political and social issues, including the election of Donald Trump and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While she enjoys greater autonomy and access to healthcare in Spain, she expresses concern about the potential global impact of U.S. political decisions. She fears Trump's potential re-election could embolden far-right movements in Europe and negatively impact the global economy. She notes the growing influence of misinformation and nationalism in the U.S., making it difficult for Americans to understand perspectives from outside their bubble.</p>

The prevailing view is that current AI models are not conscious, but continued advancements and research could change that.</p>
