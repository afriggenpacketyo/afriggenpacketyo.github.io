            <p>South Korea has announced a substantial $23.25 billion support package for its semiconductor industry in response to potential U.S. tariffs on imported semiconductors. This funding will be used to subsidize the construction of underground power transmission lines, increase infrastructure funding for industrial complexes, and offer low-interest loans to semiconductor companies. The U.S. Department of Commerce is also investigating the national security implications of semiconductor imports, adding to the uncertainty. South Korea, home to major chipmakers like Samsung and SK Hynix, relies heavily on semiconductor exports, with the U.S. being its second-largest export destination. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration claims it lacks the authority to force El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, despite court orders stating otherwise. Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, and President Nayib Bukele has stated he will not voluntarily return him. The Department of Homeland Security argues it cannot forcibly extract an individual from the custody of a foreign nation. This situation has sparked controversy, with the administration facing criticism for its handling of the deportation and its apparent inability to rectify the error.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in an antitrust trial defending the company against allegations of operating a social media monopoly through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argues that Meta unfairly dominated the market and seeks to break up the company by forcing a spinoff of either Instagram or WhatsApp. Zuckerberg argued that Meta improved Instagram over the years and acquired it for its camera technology, not its social network. The FTC cites Zuckerberg's past emails as evidence that Meta acquired the apps to neutralize competition.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen over $2 billion in federal funds for Harvard University after the institution rejected a list of demands aimed at combating antisemitism and ideological bias on campus.

            <p>Britannia Jinky Jersey, the owner of Pontins holiday parks, has been charged with corporate manslaughter following the death of a guest at Pontins Brean Sands. Wendy Jones died after an air conditioning duct collapsed on guests in the entertainment center, injuring eighteen people. The incident occurred in February 2019, and Jones spent six months in the hospital before passing away. The company will appear in court next month.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated firmly that he will not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S., despite the man's mistaken deportation to a high-security prison in El Salvador. During a meeting with President Trump, Bukele dismissed the idea as preposterous, referring to Abrego Garcia as a "terrorist." This decision complicates the situation, as the Trump administration had acknowledged the error and the Supreme Court had ordered them to facilitate his return. The incident has raised questions about deportation practices and international relations.</p>

            <p>Harvard University decided to defy the Trump administration's demands for federal funding, citing the importance of independence over money. The administration threatened to revoke $9 billion in federal grants if Harvard agreed to conditions like screening foreign applicants for American values. By rejecting these terms, Harvard seemed to have learned from Columbia's compliance, which didn't yield the return of funds. This decision highlights the ongoing tensions between academic institutions and political pressures.</p>

            <p>President Trump's rhetoric and actions toward Canada, including mentions of it becoming the "51st state" and imposing tariffs, have raised concerns about his intentions. Border disputes, access to natural resources, and trade disagreements contribute to the strained relationship. Some analysts suggest that Trump's actions reflect a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy, prioritizing a continental fortress and control over key resources. The situation has led to broken trust and uncertainty about the future of the U.S.-Canada relationship.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, potentially leading to tariffs on both sectors based on national security concerns. The investigations will assess the impact of these imports and could result in tariffs under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Drugmakers argue that tariffs could increase shortages and reduce patient access, while the US relies heavily on chip imports from Taiwan. This move could reshape trade relationships and domestic manufacturing strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
