          <p>Myanmar is experiencing a scramble for rare earth minerals, leading to environmental damage and deaths in Kachin State. According to DW, the in-situ leaching technique used to extract these minerals poses significant risks to the environment and local villagers. Chinese companies are sourcing rare earths from Myanmar, which are used in products made by global auto giants and wind power firms. Activists are calling for responsible mining and more public oversight of safety at the operations.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, initial hopes for change have largely gone unfulfilled, particularly in the U.S. According to DW, while the Black Lives Matter movement raised awareness globally, progress has been limited, with Trump's administration rolling back police reforms and DEI programs. Despite this, some positive changes include increased dialogue about racism and bans on the knee-to-neck maneuver used on Floyd. The police killed at least 1,260 people in the US in 2024, and Black people are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by police than white people.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's death, the right-wing narrative is being reshaped, with some conservatives calling for a pardon for Derek Chauvin. According to The New York Times article, facts that were once universally agreed upon are now being disputed, with conservatives packaging misleading details to build a case that Mr. Chauvin was railroaded. Prominent Trump supporters have joined the defense of Mr. Chauvin, and misinformation has circulated, leading to a shift in the narrative and a focus on undermining police reform.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis' police chief, Brian O'Hara, is working toward change within the department. According to CBS News, O'Hara is focused on implementing changes that lead to safer streets and more positive interactions with Minneapolis police. While shootings are trending down, violent crime has not improved much since 2020, and the police department continues to face an officer shortage. O'Hara is determined to make a difference with the resources he has and has focused on "getting back to the basics."</p>
