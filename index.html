          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a 77-year-old former member of the Manson family, has been recommended for parole after being convicted of seven counts of murder in 1971. A California panel determined that Krenwinkel, who was part of the infamous Manson crew, poses a minimal risk of reoffending if released. This recommendation marks a significant step in her potential release after decades of incarceration. The decision reflects the panel's assessment of her rehabilitation and current risk level.</p>

Kesha emphasized the importance of living in alignment with her integrity and recognized that AI should be used as a tool, not a replacement.

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that the government will face "unavoidable" difficult decisions regarding public spending in the upcoming Spending Review. The IFS suggests that the amount of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly influence whether cuts are made in other unprotected sectors, such as transport, net-zero initiatives, schools, and the criminal justice system. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' commitment to avoiding additional borrowing and tax increases intensifies speculation about potential spending cuts. The government's strategy of front-loading spending in the initial years of the parliament term will now require confronting the consequences of slowing down spending.</p>

          <p>The sale of single-use disposable vapes is now prohibited across the UK, aiming to safeguard children's health and protect the environment. While shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping. Retailers violating the ban in England and Wales could face fines, while health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping. Vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, but long-term risks are still unknown, according to the NHS.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, has warned that Chinaâ€™s quantum satellite, Micius, could be hacked due to tiny time delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers to compromise the quantum key distribution, which is meant to be theoretically unhackable. Miller's analysis of communication data between a ground station and Micius revealed the distribution of quantum keys was insecure.
