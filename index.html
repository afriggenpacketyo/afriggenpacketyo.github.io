            <h2>Attorneys Claim Venezuelan Migrants Face Imminent Deportation to El Salvador Under Alien Enemies Act</h2>

            <p>Attorneys for several Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas assert their clients are at immediate risk of deportation to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority used to remove non-citizens with limited due process. The ACLU filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order after attorneys reported ICE officers informed their clients they would be deported, even without signing papers. The administration argues the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a "hybrid criminal state" justifying the deportations. This action follows the Trump administration's recent invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador, raising concerns about due process and human rights.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who was wrongfully deported due to an "administrative error," according to the Justice Department. President Trump criticized Van Hollen's visit, asserting that Abrego Garcia has a bad record and alleging MS-13 gang affiliation, claims disputed by Abrego Garcia's family and attorneys. The Supreme Court and a Maryland federal judge ordered the U.S. government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. The meeting occurred after Van Hollen was initially blocked from entering the prison where Abrego Garcia is held, highlighting the complexities and political tensions surrounding the case.</p>

            <p>A Florida elementary school teacher, Karly Anderson, has been placed on administrative leave after attending a "white lie party" where underage drinking, marijuana use, and a gun were present. The party, held at the home of a former principal, involved approximately 200 kids, including students from several area schools. Anderson, initially charged with felony child abuse, now faces misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and intoxication. The superintendent of Brevard Public Schools deemed Anderson's behavior unacceptable and initiated a further investigation after police body camera footage revealed her yelling at an officer at the scene.</p>

It also criticizes Dr. Anthony Fauci and the mainstream media for discrediting the lab leak theory.

The author argues that conservatives should be wary of expanding administrative authority in this domain, citing concerns about potential for reprisal and the case being a poor fit for modern textualists.

            <h2>Why Australia is Euthanizing Koalas from Helicopters</h2>

            <p>The Australian government has shot and likely killed several hundred koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park due to starvation and suffering following a massive bushfire. The government says the program is intended to end the koalas’ suffering from burns and starvation, while advocates cite logging, development, and commercial plantations, making the koalas move to the park. Experts are skeptical that shooting the animals from helicopters is the best approach. Habitat loss and climate change are key factors in making wildfires more frequent and damaging, creating challenging decisions for wildlife management.</p>

            <p>Power has been restored to nearly all customers in Puerto Rico after an island-wide blackout earlier this week. The outage, which affected more than 1.45 million customers, was caused by a transmission line failure. Authorities are investigating whether a series of breakers failed or if overgrown vegetation is to blame. Outages have been a chronic problem for Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria in 2017, highlighting the fragility of the island's power grid.</p>

The camp, home to 700,000 internally displaced people, was ravaged by an intense ground and aerial assault. Those fleeing recount being robbed, attacked, and separated from family members. Medical charity Doctors Without Borders reports treating numerous people with gunshot wounds, including children, and warns of overwhelmed facilities. The RSF has denied reports of atrocities, and has taken over the camp. The ongoing conflict in Sudan has forced many to embark on yet another testing journey, with many having to flee to the town of Tawila.</p>

            <p>Approximately 10,000 pages of previously unreleased records related to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy have been made public. The release, ordered by President Trump, aims to provide transparency regarding the investigation into Kennedy's death. RFK's son, Robert F.

The files had not been digitized and sat for decades in storage facilities maintained by the federal government.

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering plans to end most of its routine food safety inspections, effectively outsourcing this oversight to state and local authorities. The agency would focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. Some FDA employees have been working on this possible shift for years, which could free up resources. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico. The agency is responsible for the safety of much of the U.S. food supply distributed over state lines.</p>

Patients taking the medication are urged to check their dosage and contact their GP or pharmacist if they have been prescribed 10mg tablets.

            <p>Ukraine has imposed sanctions on three Chinese companies, a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused China of supplying weapons to Russia, an accusation Beijing has denied. The sanctions mean the companies will not be able to do business with Ukraine and any assets they have in the country will be frozen. Zelenskyy announced the sanctions on an aeronautics firm and two industrial component companies, all registered in China. Analysts say Ukraine has been moving away from its studiously neutral stance towards China.</p>

            <p>In-N-Out, a popular burger chain, faces ethical scrutiny regarding its beef supply, specifically concerning the use of antibiotics in cattle. While In-N-Out emphasizes the absence of fillers and additives in its beef, it remains silent on the issue of antibiotics. The use of antibiotics in animal agriculture has raised concerns about humans developing antibiotic resistance. In 2018, In-N-Out's beef received an "F" grade from consumer advocacy networks due to the use of antibiotics, contrasting with Shake Shack's "A" grade for antibiotic-free meat.</p>
