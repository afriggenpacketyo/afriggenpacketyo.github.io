          <p>With persistent inflation challenging savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to earn returns that outpace inflation. Locking in high rates for the CD's term provides a safe investment option, generally insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. Currently, short-term CDs (six months to one year) have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Strategies like CD laddering can help savers take advantage of these high rates while also saving for the long term (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>With a national average savings account interest rate of 0.42%, high-yield savings accounts offer significantly better returns, ranging from 4.10% to 4.40%.

However, escalating tariffs between the U.S. and China in April had previously led some Chinese airlines to refuse Boeing plane deliveries.

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations have reconvened in Istanbul for another round of peace talks brokered by the U.S., despite recent escalations including a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's bomber fleet. Ukraine is seeking a full 30-day ceasefire, but Russia has refused, maintaining maximalist war goals. President Zelenskyy outlined Ukraine's priorities for the meeting, including a ceasefire, prisoner release, and the return of abducted children. The talks occur amid heightened military activity and mutual accusations of sabotaging peace efforts. </p>

          <p>European Union member states are expected to vote to restrict access to the bloc's procurement markets for Chinese medical device manufacturers. This move responds to China's refusal to open its tenders to EU firms and marks the first use of the bloc's international procurement instrument (IPI). The decision follows a European Commission investigation that found clear evidence of China unfairly limiting EU medical device producers' access to government contracts. The restrictions could be implemented within weeks, potentially adding tension to EU-China trade relations. </p>

          <p>Japan's revenue from the departure tax collected from travelers in fiscal year 2024 has hit a record high due to a surge in visitors.

The government imposes a 1,000 yen International Tourist Tax on each traveler leaving the country. The increase in visitors is attributed to a weaker yen and more flights, prompting discussions about raising the departure tax to further promote tourism. </p>
