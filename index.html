          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 13% in extended trading after releasing its first quarterly earnings report since its initial public offering. While the company's revenue of $249.6 million slightly surpassed expectations and grew 41% year-over-year, its third-quarter revenue forecast implies a slowdown in growth. Despite the stock drop, Figma reported a net income of $846,000, a significant improvement from a loss in the previous year, and maintained a strong net retention rate of 129%. The company also continues to invest in AI features and strategic acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has voided the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was illegal. The court determined that the administration's move was retaliatory, stemming from Harvard's refusal to comply with demands that infringed upon First Amendment protections. Judge Allison Burroughs noted that the administration's focus on antisemitism as a reason for the freeze appeared pretextual, as the decision was made before any real inquiry into the issue on campus. The ruling bars the administration from enforcing the funding freeze against the university.</p>

          <p>Legal experts have raised significant concerns that a recent U.S. military strike in the Caribbean, which killed 11 alleged drug traffickers, may have violated international human rights and maritime law. The White House stated the vessel, operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel, was destroyed in international waters, but specialists argue the use of lethal force without an immediate threat could be considered an extrajudicial killing. Critics contend that designating the cartel as a terrorist organization does not automatically make its members lawful military targets outside of a formal armed conflict. The Pentagon has not yet detailed the legal authority it used to justify the strike.</p>

          <p>Minnesota's Democratic Governor, Tim Walz, is facing backlash from conservatives for comments made at a Labor Day event that appeared to allude to President Donald Trump's health. Walz remarked that people wake up "thinking there might be news," a statement widely interpreted as a reference to recent unfounded online rumors about the president's demise. Critics on social media condemned the comments as inappropriate and disrespectful, particularly given recent assassination attempts on the president. This incident is part of a pattern of Walz adopting a more confrontational tone against Trump in recent months.</p>

          <p>A historic funicular streetcar in Lisbon, Portugal, derailed, resulting in at least 15 fatalities and injuring 18 others, with several in serious condition. Preliminary information suggests a safety cable on the electric tram, known as the Elevador da Gloria, may have broken, causing the tragic accident. In response to the incident, the mayor of Lisbon has declared a three-day period of mourning, and Portugal's Prime Minister's Office announced a national day of mourning.

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced the state's intention to eliminate all childhood vaccine mandates, a move that would make it the first in the nation to do so. This policy would affect long-standing requirements for vaccines against diseases like measles and polio for children attending public schools. The announcement was met with strong criticism from medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warned that removing these mandates is dangerous and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases. Dr. Ladapo defended the decision, framing it as a matter of personal freedom and parental rights.</p>

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office has announced that no criminal charges will be brought against the four Pocatello police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism.

The officers were responding to a 911 call about a male with a knife and were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities at the time of the incident. The family's attorney expressed disappointment but not surprise at the decision and plans to proceed with a civil wrongful death lawsuit.</p>

Survivors of Epstein's abuse criticized the president's "hoax" characterization, with one calling the comment deeply hurtful.

Concerns over security, economic strain, and the rise of far-right parties have led many countries, including historically welcoming nations like Sweden, to adopt more restrictive policies. This analysis details how the continent has moved from open arms to building fences and outsourcing border control to non-EU countries.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on Guangzhou Tengyue Chemical, a China-based company, for allegedly manufacturing and distributing fentanyl precursor chemicals and other illicit opioids into the United States. The sanctions also target two of the company's representatives. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to combat the opioid crisis by targeting the sources of the deadly synthetic drug. The State Department accused China of playing a central role in the crisis by not only failing to stop the flow of these chemicals but by actively sustaining the business.</p>

          <p>Key Republican senators on the Banking Committee have stated they will not consider a replacement for Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook until her lawsuit against President Trump is resolved. Trump recently attempted to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies and is challenging in court. Senators Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis indicated that they will let the judicial process play out before considering any new nominee for her position. Their stance creates a potential roadblock for the administration, as Republican unanimity on the committee is needed to advance a new Fed pick.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares fell 4% in after-hours trading after the company provided a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, despite beating earnings and revenue estimates for its fiscal second quarter. The company's revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $10.24 billion, but its guidance for the third quarter fell slightly short of analyst expectations. While Salesforce raised its full-year earnings outlook, its continued single-digit revenue growth has caused the stock to underperform compared to other large-cap tech companies this year, as it has yet to see a major lift from the AI boom.

          <p>Nvidia's stock showed signs of stabilization this week, suggesting a recent pullback may be easing after the company maintained its full-year outlook despite investor concerns about weaker sales in China. Wall Street analysts view the company's long-term prospects as strong, driven by sustained demand for data center and AI infrastructure, with major cloud providers placing orders that provide visibility for multiple quarters. While China remains an area of uncertainty due to U.S. restrictions on chip shipments, robust demand from the U.S. and Europe is expected to offset some of the risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy, Julián Guzman, was fatally shot in Houston after playing "ding dong ditch," a prank involving ringing a neighbor's doorbell and running away. The suspect, 42-year-old Gonzalo Leon Jr., a U.S. Army veteran, allegedly fired two shots as the boy and his cousin fled, striking Julián in the back. Leon has been charged with murder and his bond was set at $1 million. Prosecutors argue that self-defense laws do not apply in this case, as the child posed no threat. The incident highlights a tragic trend of violent responses to the age-old prank, which has seen a resurgence due to social media.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, a major display of national pride and military strength, has drawn varied reactions from Western leaders. U.S. President Donald Trump described the event as "very, very impressive" but expressed concern that the United States was not acknowledged for its historical role in helping China. In a social media post, Trump also appeared to accuse Chinese President Xi Jinping of conspiring with the leaders of Russia and North Korea against the United States. The parade and the reactions to it underscore the complex and often tense geopolitical relationships between the global powers.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window saw clubs spend a record £3 billion, widening the financial gap with other European leagues and raising concerns about competitive balance within English football itself. Experts note that Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) are creating a "glass ceiling," forcing aspirational clubs to sell homegrown talent to comply, often to the league's elite teams. This trend has led to calls for rule changes to prevent a growing polarization between a few dominant clubs and the rest of the league. The spending also highlights the increasing financial disparity between the top flight and the lower divisions.</p>

          <p>The national conflict over congressional redistricting is intensifying, with new fronts opening in Missouri and Maryland. In Missouri, Republicans are advancing a map that would likely eliminate the state's only majority-Black district, represented by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who has vowed a legal challenge. In response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states, Maryland Democrats are considering a plan to eliminate their state's single Republican-held congressional seat. These moves reflect an escalating tit-for-tat strategy between the two parties as they seek to maximize their advantages ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into allegations that the LA Clippers circumvented the league's salary cap through a $28 million payment to star player Kawhi Leonard from a third-party company. A media report detailed that Aspiration Partners, a firm partially funded by Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, contracted Leonard for a sum far exceeding typical endorsement deals, with little evidence of work performed. The Clippers have strongly denied the claims, stating their relationship with Aspiration ended years ago and they were unaware of any improper activity. If found guilty, the team could face significant fines and the loss of draft picks.</p>

He reiterated demands for Ukraine to remain outside of NATO and to cease what he terms discrimination against ethnic Russians. The comments were made amid ongoing efforts by U.S. President Trump to broker an end to the full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.</p>
