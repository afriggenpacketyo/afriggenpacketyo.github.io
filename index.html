          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the UK's intention to recognize a Palestinian state by September, contingent on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a long-term peace process in Gaza. This significant policy shift aims to alleviate the severe suffering of Palestinians and secure the release of hostages, expressing hope it will affect the situation on the ground. The decision has drawn mixed reactions from opposition parties, with some advocating for immediate recognition and others criticizing it as ill-timed political posturing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the move, stating it rewards "Hamas's monstrous terrorism" and would lead to a "jihadist state."</p>

          <h2>EPA Revokes Landmark Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, Citing Cost Savings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 22:26:58 EDT</div>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," a landmark scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Administrator Lee Zeldin presented this as the largest deregulatory action in U.S. history, claiming it would save Americans $54 billion annually by repealing related vehicle and engine regulations. This move comes despite the EPA's own regulatory impact report projecting trillions in net benefits from limiting emissions over 30 years. Critics, including scientists and environmental groups, decry the move as "criminal negligence" and a dangerous disregard for climate science, vowing immediate legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting widespread tsunami warnings and advisories across the Pacific. Hawaii and parts of Alaska received tsunami warnings, while Japan issued an alert, with potential waves of 1 to 3 meters in several coastal areas including Chile and the Solomon Islands. Authorities urged immediate action, stressing that danger could persist for hours as subsequent waves arrive. The quake caused significant shaking in nearby Russian cities, and this event underscores the ongoing seismic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials are pushing for an ordinance to prohibit law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from concealing their identities while on duty in public. This move follows recent federal immigration raids where agents wore masks and refused to display identification, sparking widespread fear and criticism among residents. The proposed measure mandates officers to visibly display identification and agency affiliation, with limited exceptions for medical protection or undercover operations. While aiming to increase transparency and accountability, the county acknowledges that enforcing this against federal agencies like ICE may ultimately be decided by a court.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 5-3 comeback victory over the Cincinnati Reds, overcoming a multi-run deficit with clutch hits in the late innings. Will Smith delivered a go-ahead, two-out RBI double in the ninth, scoring James Outman from first, after he and Freddie Freeman had tied the game in the seventh. Despite an earlier struggle with runners in scoring position and a disappointing four-plus-inning, four-run start from pitcher Tyler Glasnow, the Dodgers' bullpen held strong, allowing the offense to rally. This hard-fought win marked a significant turnaround for a team that has faced offensive struggles this month, improving their overall score.</p>

          <p>Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), announced it would maintain its monetary policy, despite projecting a moderation in economic growth for the second half of 2025 from its strong first-half pace. The MAS cited global trade concerns, particularly from the Trump administration's tariffs, as a key factor impacting its export-dependent economy. While Singapore avoided a technical recession in the second quarter with 1.4% growth, the central bank indicated that trade-related sectors are likely to see some pullback. Economists suggest the MAS remains open to future policy adjustments, especially if U.S. tariffs significantly impact growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta suggested a "legal pathway" for Democrats to present new congressional district maps directly to voters on a statewide ballot, bypassing the independent redistricting commission. This strategic move aims to counter Republican efforts to gerrymander districts in conservative states like Texas, potentially securing several additional seats for Democrats in the U.S. House. The measure would ask voters to temporarily rescind the commission's power, allowing the state Legislature to draw new boundaries for a special election.

This data, lower than economists' expectations, significantly strengthens the case for a potential RBA interest rate cut at its upcoming August meeting. Despite the favorable inflation figures, the RBA had previously kept rates steady, citing stronger-than-forecast indicators and a tight labor market. Analysts now anticipate a 25-basis-point cut, influenced by weaker global growth and rising unemployment, signaling a potential shift in monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top officials from the U.S. and China concluded "constructive" trade talks in Stockholm, agreeing to continue efforts to extend their 90-day tariff truce, which is set to expire next month. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that any extension hinges on President Donald Trump's approval, while downplaying escalation risks. The discussions covered each other's economies, implementation of terms previously agreed by Trump and Xi Jinping, and rare earths, a key sticking point. Both sides acknowledged the importance of safeguarding stable trade relations amidst broader geopolitical tensions, with the U.S. pressing China on dealings with Russia and Iran.</p>

          <p>A sexual assault crisis charity, Survivors' Network, is launching a new support service exclusively for biological women, following a legal dispute over the inclusion of transgender women in its existing groups. The decision comes after a woman, "Sarah," sued the charity, citing discomfort discussing her trauma in the presence of a transgender woman. This new 12-month pilot group, funded by the Office of Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner, will run alongside current meetings that include trans and non-binary individuals. The move reflects a UK Supreme Court ruling on single-sex services and aims to provide a space imperative for some biological women's healing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hours after his term was extended by the Trump administration, L.A.'s top federal prosecutor, U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli, moved to dismiss charges in two highly controversial criminal cases. These include a $47 million "sham loan" scheme against a Trump donor and an excessive force case against a sheriff's deputy already convicted and sentenced. The dismissals have sparked outrage and triggered prosecutor resignations, with allegations that Essayli linked case outcomes to his permanent appointment. Critics decry the moves as a "travesty of justice," questioning the integrity of the legal process and the appearance of political influence in the justice system.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with a 51-47 party-line vote. Nominated by President Trump, Monarez, who holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor, has been praised for her commitment to rebuilding public trust. During her confirmation hearing, she affirmed vaccine efficacy and the safety of fluoridated water, directly refuting some past criticisms from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Her role will be crucial in guiding public health policy and maintaining scientific independence within the agency, despite political pressures.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how online platforms have fragmented and distorted political and cultural discourse, using a recent Sydney Sweeney advertisement as a case study. It argues that online interactions often involve individuals issuing statements rather than engaging in genuine dialogue, stripping context and fueling widespread outrage. The piece highlights how various actors, from political figures to content creators, exploit these moments for attention, reducing complex issues to simplified, often cynical, narratives. Ultimately, it suggests that this "algorithmic grist" creates widespread upset without productive resolution, leaving society feeling both victorious and defeated in the digital sphere.</p>

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey indicates a tight race to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett emerging as leading contenders. While President Trump has frequently criticized Powell, the survey suggests he is unlikely to fire him before his term ends in May 2026. Respondents believe Trump's pressure for rate cuts is having the opposite effect, making them less likely. The outlook also notes a modest boost in economic outlook but continued caution regarding the stock market, with 84% of respondents seeing stocks as somewhat or extremely overvalued.

          <p>Two senators have introduced a resolution aimed at preserving the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, following reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might disband its current members. The Task Force, composed of voluntary, independent medical experts, provides evidence-based recommendations for primary care, which are tied to health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Supporters argue that disrupting this process would be detrimental to American health and could lead to unproven interventions. The resolution serves as a strong message to the administration to maintain the Task Force's independent, scientific foundation and prevent partisan interference.</p>

          <p>An ophthalmologist has issued strong warnings about common habits that can severely damage eyesight, particularly emphasizing the dangers of sleeping or showering with contact lenses. This practice significantly increases the risk of corneal ulcers, which can lead to permanent vision loss or even necessitate an eyeball removal in severe cases. The doctor also cautioned against using tap water to rinse or store lenses due to contamination risks, advising to discard lenses if solution is unavailable. She stressed the importance of consistent eye protection during activities that could cause injury, and advised against self-removing foreign objects from the eye.</p>

Tamura's note referenced CTE and blamed the NFL for concealing its dangers. While CTE can only be diagnosed posthumously, a 2017 study found 88% of examined former players had it, and it's associated with violent mood swings and suicidal thoughts.
