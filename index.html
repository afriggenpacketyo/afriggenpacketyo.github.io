        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has finalized the signing of Swedish striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record fee of £125 million, which could potentially rise to £130 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old completed his medical and signed a six-year contract, expressing his motivation to "create history and win trophies" with the club. The deal was announced on the final day of the transfer window, concluding a lengthy negotiation process after an initial £110 million offer was rejected in August. Isak's arrival at Anfield marks a major acquisition for the Premier League team.</p>

The 24-year-old reported stomach pain at the team facility and was advised to undergo immediate surgery. Coach Dave Canales has described Ekwonu's status as "day-to-day," and he did not participate in Monday's practice. Ekwonu, a former first-round draft pick, has been a durable starter for the team, and his potential absence could lead to backup Yosh Nijman stepping into the starting role for the upcoming game.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's planned transfer for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi has collapsed on the final day of the transfer window. A £35 million deal had been agreed upon, and the 25-year-old was undergoing a medical when Crystal Palace withdrew from the arrangement. The club's decision was reportedly due to their failure to secure a suitable replacement after their target, Igor Julio, chose to sign with West Ham instead. Despite the setback for Guehi and Liverpool, he will now return to Palace, where he remains a key player, though his long-term future is uncertain as he enters the final year of his contract.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has successfully completed a season-long loan deal for Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho. The agreement stipulates that Villa will cover at least 80% of Sancho's significant weekly wages, with bonuses expected to cover the full amount for Manchester United. The 25-year-old England international, who joined United for £73 million four years ago, has not played for the club since August 2024. This move follows previous loan spells at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, and it provides Sancho with a new opportunity to play in the Premier League after turning down a move to Roma earlier in the transfer window.</p>

Maduro claims the deployment, which includes multiple U.S. military vessels, is the "greatest threat" the continent has seen in a century. The U.S. government states the increased maritime presence is aimed at combating drug trafficking operations from Latin American cartels. This escalation in rhetoric follows Washington's accusation that Maduro leads a drug cartel and comes amid ongoing political tensions and the U.S. not recognizing his presidency.</p>

The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores the crisis in Kerr's life following his first professional loss, which triggered struggles with substance abuse and personal relationships. Johnson's performance, supported by facial prosthetics, is a central focus of the film, which also co-stars Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend.

          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has decreased by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year, reflecting the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies. This decline affects key sectors like agriculture, construction, and services, where immigrants constitute a significant portion of the labor force. Economists note that the slowdown in immigration could strain regional labor markets and complicate economic signals for policymakers. The trend is attributed to increased deportations, reduced legal protections, and a drop in border crossings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 800 people and causing widespread destruction in remote mountain villages. Survivors in the hard-hit provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar have described scenes of shock and despair, with entire villages reduced to rubble. Rescue efforts are being hampered by the region's difficult terrain and blocked roads, forcing reliance on helicopters. Eyewitnesses report that many residents are too shocked to speak, while volunteers and officials work to dig graves and pull injured people from collapsed homes, highlighting the scale of the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the United States are facing significant financial challenges. Stations are launching emergency fundraising drives, cutting jobs, and reducing local programming to cope with the budget shortfalls. While public response has been strong in some areas, many smaller and rural stations are struggling to fill the gap. National networks are reducing dues to help, and philanthropic efforts are underway, but the long-term viability of some stations remains uncertain as they navigate this new financial reality.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized comments reportedly made by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding plans for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine. Von der Leyen had suggested that "precise plans" were being developed for post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius called the public discussion of such topics "completely wrong" before negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have even begun. He emphasized that the EU lacks the jurisdiction for troop deployments and urged caution, while acknowledging that deliberations about potential future scenarios are ongoing behind the scenes.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has confirmed that his team for the upcoming event at Bethpage will feature 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. However, he warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" performance, emphasizing that playing on American soil presents a different challenge requiring a new strategy. Donald noted that Europe has not won a Ryder Cup in the U.S. since 2012 and that he will adapt pairings and lineups accordingly. He also urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to protest a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The move comes after her classic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was removed from some school libraries under a new provincial directive to eliminate materials with "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story sarcastically describes perfectly chaste characters to critique the policy and its supporter, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. This action is part of a growing resistance to the ban, which has affected numerous classic works of literature in the province's schools.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains at the start of the month, driven by positive developments in the defense and healthcare sectors. A significant £10 billion warship export deal between the U.K. and Norway caused shares in defense companies like BAE Systems to rise. In pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk shares increased after trial data suggested its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than its competitors. These corporate news items contributed to a positive trading session, while U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over her past purchase of a flat in Hove. Conservatives have accused Rayner of hypocrisy and called for an investigation after reports she may have saved on stamp duty by declaring the property her main home for tax purposes while classifying it as a second home for council tax. Starmer defended Rayner, highlighting her background as a story of British success and dismissing the criticism as a mistake. A spokesperson for Rayner has stated that she paid all relevant taxes entirely properly.</p>
