          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. This move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory issues, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company has shown strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a growing base of high-value customers. The IPO is seen as a positive sign for the tech market, which has seen renewed activity after a prolonged slump.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new law that significantly expands its ban on smoking to include most public areas like beaches, parks, and spaces near schools and libraries. The move aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, and combat the high rate of tobacco-related deaths in the country. Violators of the new rules face fines starting at 135 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While smoking has been illegal in indoor venues like restaurants since 2008, café terraces remain one of the last public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>The University of Pennsylvania has agreed to prohibit transgender women from competing on its women's sports teams as part of a resolution with the U.S. Department of Education. The agreement settles a federal civil rights case that found the university had violated the rights of female athletes, a case that centered on swimmer Lia Thomas. As part of the settlement, Penn will restore records and titles to female athletes who competed against Thomas and must adopt "biology-based" definitions of sex. This decision reflects the Trump administration's broader policy efforts regarding transgender athletes in sports.</p>

          <p>A revamped advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has voted to recommend against the use of flu vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. This recommendation, which the CDC must still approve, targets a long-standing concern of the anti-vaccine movement, despite numerous studies finding no evidence of harm from the substance. Public health experts worry that removing the few remaining multi-dose vials with thimerosal could reduce vaccine availability and reinforce unfounded fears about vaccine safety.

Speaking at a migrant detention center, Trump stated that even citizens "born in our country" should be removed if they commit serious offenses. This follows a memo from a Trump-appointed Justice Department official granting U.S. attorneys discretion to pursue denaturalization. Legal scholars note that denaturalization is typically reserved for rare cases like treason or fraud during the naturalization process, not for unrelated crimes.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, President Donald Trump threatened potential legal action against two political figures, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Trump called Mamdani a "communist," questioned his citizenship, and said he would have to be arrested if he interfered with federal immigration enforcement. He also suggested he would have the current Homeland Security Secretary "take a look at" prosecuting Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House in 2024 but acquitted by the Senate. These comments came shortly after Trump publicly feuded with Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska provided a critical vote to help pass President Trump's massive tax-and-spending bill, enabling it to clear the Senate. Murkowski, who had expressed reservations about the bill's cuts to social programs like SNAP, ultimately voted in favor after securing last-minute benefits for her state. These included a boost in funding for rural hospitals and a two-year exemption for Alaska from certain SNAP cuts due to its high error rate. While she stated she did not like the bill overall, she defended her vote as necessary to protect Alaska's unique interests.</p>

Fiscal conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have already expressed concern that the Senate's changes increase the deficit, while centrists remain worried about cuts to social programs.</p>

The piece connects this to similar rhetoric aimed at other opponents, like NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. It warns that such threats could silence dissent among the 25 million naturalized citizens in the U.S.</p>

While MLB players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values due to longer terms, NBA players consistently earn higher average annual salaries because of smaller roster sizes.

          <p>The Republican spending bill passed by the Senate would cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, which could leave nearly 12 million people uninsured by 2034, according to the CBO. A large portion of the savings comes from establishing a strict national work requirement for many beneficiaries and capping provider taxes that states use to help fund their Medicaid programs.

          <p>Three Republican senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina—broke with their party to vote against President Trump's major spending bill. Senator Collins cited the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid, which she argued would threaten healthcare access and rural hospitals in her state.
