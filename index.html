            <h2>House Conservatives Oppose Senate GOP Tax Cut Framework</h2>

            <p>House conservatives are expressing strong opposition to the Senate-approved budget framework for the Trump tax cut and spending cut package, arguing it doesn't sufficiently reduce spending. Despite President Trump's desire for the House to accept the Senate's plan, at least 5-10 House Republicans are firmly against it, potentially jeopardizing its passage. The framework is crucial for enabling the Senate to use budget reconciliation, avoiding a filibuster and requiring alignment between the House and Senate before proceeding with the tax cut bill. Speaker Johnson has scheduled a House vote for Wednesday to address the issue, while concerns grow about the debt ceiling and potential market volatility.</p>

            <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to advise the CDC to cease recommending fluoride in drinking water nationwide and is forming a task force to address the issue. This announcement coincides with the EPA's review of scientific data concerning potential health risks associated with fluoride in drinking water. Utah recently became the first state to ban fluoride in public water systems, a move praised by Kennedy, who has previously labeled fluoride a dangerous neurotoxin. The CDC currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water to prevent tooth decay, a practice considered a major public health achievement for decades.</p>

            <p>President Trump is digging in on his tariff plan, threatening even stiffer levies on China as trade tensions deepen, creating further market turbulence. Despite rumors of a possible pause, Trump denies any consideration of altering course, stating negotiations will proceed bilaterally with individual countries, with no guarantee of success. He intends to escalate trade war with China after Beijing retaliates with tariffs of its own, and would add another 50% tariff increase on Chinese imports, and is also negotiating with countries including Israel and Japan. The president's mixed messages have caused concern among investors and allies, with some warning of a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Construction is slated to begin this year and be completed by 2027, including the development of coal terminals on both sides of the border.

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer acknowledges the likelihood of an impending economic recession due to President Trump's new tariffs, but advises investors to remain calm and avoid panic selling. While the tariffs pose a significant threat to the U.S. economy, Cramer does not anticipate a second Great Recession, citing the strength of financial institutions. He suggests that Trump could alleviate market concerns by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate trade deals. Cramer believes that Trump will need to balance inflation, trade negotiations, and employment to make the tariffs successful, otherwise, he will declare victory and reverse them, making select stocks potentially present buying opportunities.

            <p>A false post on X, formerly Twitter, regarding a potential pause on tariffs triggered multi-trillion-dollar market swings on Monday. The rumor originated from an obscure finance-focused X account and was amplified by verified accounts, leading to erroneous reports by news organizations like Reuters and CNBC. The White House quickly denied the report, causing markets to reverse course, but not before significant volatility occurred. Experts highlight the dangers of social media's role in spreading misinformation, particularly with changes to verification policies that make it harder to discern trustworthy sources.</p>

            <p>Governor Ron DeSantis is responding after a federal judge temporarily blocked a new Florida law that makes it a state crime to be here illegally. DeSantis attacked the judge calling her an “activist judge”. The Governor said he was fully anticipating the legal challenge, and that the state won’t “take the pedal off the gas” in addressing illegal immigration. The judge’s order is just days after Florida Immigrant Coalition and the Farmworkers Association of Florida filed suit against the state, claiming the law is unconstitutional.</p>

The article also addresses the economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, warning of a potential recession and highlighting the disconnect between Trump's supporters and the consequences of his policies.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily halted a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to return a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Justice Department argued that the order was an overreach and that the government no longer had jurisdiction over Garcia, who is in Salvadoran custody. Garcia was deported despite a protective order, and the Trump administration acknowledged the deportation was an 'administrative error.'

            <p>Events since the start of the year have reignited the downward spiral in relations between mainland China and Taiwan following Democratic Progressive Party leader William Lai Ching-te’s election victory last year. Beijing fears being boxed out of its political position that both sides of the strait belong to one China and thus responds forcefully to political signalling of strengthened ties between the US and Taiwan. Meanwhile, the US fears that Beijing will use force to resolve the Taiwan issue, thus responding to Beijing’s military signals with political support. This downward spiral must be examined and discussed at high levels to bring stability to the Taiwan Strait.</p>
