          <p>Famed retired money manager Howard Rubin, 70, has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts. The indictment alleges that from 2011 to 2019, Rubin, with the help of an assistant, operated a trafficking network, spending over $1 million. The encounters, some of which allegedly occurred in a specially outfitted Manhattan apartment, involved conduct that went beyond the women's consent, causing physical harm and fear. Rubin, previously known for his role in a major trading loss at Merrill Lynch detailed in the book "Liar's Poker," is accused of using non-disclosure agreements to intimidate victims.</p>

          <p>Virginia's Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, publicly condemned transgender bathroom policies as "nonsense" during a campaign stop outside a Fairfax County Public Schools board meeting. Her remarks address recent local controversies, including an incident where a male student allegedly used the girls' locker room. Earle-Sears emphasized the need to protect female students and criticized her political opponent, Abigail Spanberger, for not taking a clear stance on the issue. In response, Spanberger advocated for a case-by-case approach that was previously in place and shifted focus to Virginia's educational performance under Earle-Sears's tenure as lieutenant governor.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new series of significant tariffs on a range of imported goods, set to take effect on October 1. The measures include a 100% tariff on branded pharmaceuticals, a 50% tariff on cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks. The administration stated the tariffs on home goods are to counter unfair "flooding" of products into the U.S. market for national security reasons. The pharmaceutical tariff includes an exemption for companies actively building manufacturing plants within the United States, a move aimed at encouraging domestic production.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced to reporters that a deal concerning the conflict in Gaza appears to be imminent. While not providing specific details, he indicated the agreement would secure the return of hostages, bring an end to the war, and establish peace in the region. This statement comes amid recent reports suggesting a plan that would involve former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair leading a temporary administration in the Gaza Strip. The President's brief but optimistic announcement suggests a significant development in the long-standing conflict, although the full scope and feasibility of the proposed deal remain unclear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, President Donald Trump asserted that the charges are about "justice" and not political retribution. Speaking to reporters, Trump claimed that Comey had lied to Congress and predicted that others would also face charges, referring to them as "corrupt, radical left Democrats."

The President's comments follow his long-standing public criticism of Comey and his recent calls for the Justice Department to take action against his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Shares of Boeing experienced a significant surge after the Federal Aviation Administration announced it would ease restrictions on the company's aircraft deliveries. The FAA will restore Boeing's authority to conduct its own final safety certifications for 737 Max jets, a move expected to accelerate production and boost free cash flow. This development is seen as a major step forward for the aerospace giant, which has been under intense regulatory scrutiny. The article also notes that new pharmaceutical tariffs announced by the Trump administration will not affect Club holdings Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb due to their U.S. manufacturing investments.

Kennedy Jr., pointed to observational studies showing an association, not causation, between the drug's use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Medical experts and scientific bodies have expressed concern over the President's comments, emphasizing that acetaminophen is often the only approved painkiller for pregnant women.

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making a false statement and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment stems from his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020, where he allegedly lied about authorizing an FBI official to be an anonymous source for news reports concerning the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The charges were brought just days after President Trump publicly urged the Attorney General to prosecute Comey.

The charges focus on whether Comey was truthful in 2020 congressional testimony about authorizing press contacts in 2017, a matter the author argues is convoluted and difficult to prove as an intentional lie. The prosecution was initiated by a newly appointed U.S. Attorney with no prosecutorial experience after her predecessor reportedly found the case too weak to pursue.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on imported branded pharmaceuticals has raised questions about its impact on global drugmakers and U.S. consumers. The tariff, effective October 1, includes a significant exemption for companies that are currently building or have existing manufacturing plants in the United States. This carve-out may spare many large European pharmaceutical firms that have already invested in U.S. production. However, the distinction between branded and generic drugs remains unclear, creating uncertainty for exporters like India and China, while analysts predict the move will likely lead to higher costs for American patients and potential disruptions in supply chains.</p>

With the EV tax credit set to expire on September 30, this backlog comes at a critical time, forcing some dealers to carry tens of thousands of dollars in costs or stop offering the upfront rebate.

The skull, known as Yunxian 2, was once thought to be Homo erectus but now shows features closer to more modern humans like Homo sapiens. If confirmed, these findings could resolve long-standing debates about our evolutionary history and suggest a more complex, multi-regional origin for the human species.</p>

          <p>The core inflation rate, as measured by the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, held steady at 2.9% annually in August, meeting economists' expectations. According to the Commerce Department's report on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, this stability will likely keep the central bank on track to implement further interest rate reductions this year. The data also showed that consumer spending and personal income grew slightly more than anticipated, indicating economic resilience. The report suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had a limited impact on consumer prices, as businesses have largely absorbed the increased costs or used pre-tariff inventories.

The 178th edition of the event was inaugurated with the traditional tapping of a beer keg by Stuttgart's mayor. The three-week festival features hundreds of vendors, large beer tents, and fairground rides, and hopes to attract over 4 million visitors. Originating in 1818 as a harvest festival, it has evolved into a major cultural celebration, though organizers note that this year's success may be tempered by Germany's sluggish economy and its effect on consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Paccar, the parent company of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, saw its stock price increase by approximately 5% following President Donald Trump's announcement of a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The tariff, set to begin on October 1, is intended to protect domestic manufacturers from what the administration calls unfair foreign competition. According to a Bank of America analysis, Paccar manufactures over 90% of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically. The new tariff is expected to level the playing field against competitors who produce trucks more cheaply in countries like Mexico, placing Paccar in a more advantageous market position.

          <p>The UK government, under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is proposing a mandatory digital ID scheme aimed at curbing illegal employment. The digital ID would serve as authoritative proof of a person's identity and their legal right to work in the country, eventually becoming compulsory for all employers to check. The government claims this will reduce a key "pull factor" for illegal immigration by making it harder for migrants without proper status to find work in the shadow economy. While the plan aims to streamline identity verification, critics question its effectiveness, pointing out that employers in the black economy often bypass such checks entirely.</p>

Similarly, "full retirement age" would become "standard benefit age," and age 70 would be called the "maximum benefit age."
