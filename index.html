          <p>Vance Boelter is facing charges for the murder of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the attempted murder of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. According to the FBI, Boelter visited the homes of multiple lawmakers on the night of the shootings, indicating a planned series of attacks. He is charged with second-degree murder and attempted murder at the state level, and faces federal charges including stalking and murder. The FBI investigation suggests Boelter stalked his targets, researching them and conducting surveillance on their homes for an extended period.

They claim the requirements conflict with federal laws mandating non-discrimination and support for underserved groups.

While providing guaranteed income, annuities have trade-offs, including reduced liquidity and limited potential for higher returns.
