          <p>A New York judge has issued a landmark ruling, permitting the use of advanced whole genome sequencing DNA testing in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer. This decision sets a significant legal precedent, marking the first time such cutting-edge forensic evidence could be admitted in a New York court, with potential implications for future cases across the state. Prosecutors view this as a major victory, as the technology has reportedly connected Heuermann, his ex-wife, and daughter to nine hair strands found on the remains of six victims. Despite defense challenges regarding the lab's licensing and the method's accuracy for degraded samples, the court's decision underscores the evolving role of sophisticated DNA analysis in complex criminal investigations, potentially reshaping how cold cases are pursued.</p>

          <p>Netflix has rolled out an update to its "Moments" feature, enabling mobile users to customize and share specific clips from shows and movies. This new functionality allows viewers to select start and end points for video segments, saving them to their "My Netflix" tab for easy rewatching or sharing. The update coincides with the release of the second part of "Wednesday" season 2, aiming to capitalize on viral content creation, similar to the immense popularity of Wednesday's dance scene from the first season. This move is part of Netflix's broader strategy to revamp its brand, including a redesigned homepage and a TikTok-like vertical video feed, following a period of stagnation.</p>

          <p>Nurse Sandie Peggie has initiated new legal action against NHS Fife, separate from her ongoing employment tribunal related to an exchange with a trans doctor in a female changing room. Peggie's fresh claim alleges harassment and victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, stemming from three senior staff members' opposition to lifting her suspension. The article details how this information emerged during the previous tribunal, where NHS Fife was criticized for releasing a media statement about the case that was deemed "irresponsible and potentially unsafe." Peggie is also considering action against those who authorized the statement, intensifying the legal battle over gender critical beliefs and workplace conduct.</p>

The article emphasizes Reeves's dual ambition to raise funds for public services and implement structural reforms for economic growth, while asserting her authority amid recent personnel changes in Downing Street. Islam notes Reeves's dismissal of the "£50bn black hole" figure and her criticism of tax speculation, highlighting potential tensions with the Office for Budget Responsibility.

          <p>Former Senator John E. Sununu is reportedly considering a bid for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire's 2026 midterm elections, attracting attention from top national Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune. This development comes after his brother, former Governor Chris Sununu, decided against a Senate run earlier this year. Republicans are hopeful to flip the seat, left open by retiring Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, to expand their Senate majority. The article notes the competitive and expensive nature of the race, with other Republicans already in the field, and highlights the broader strategic importance of the New Hampshire seat in the upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>Senior Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Peter Welch, have urged Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ambassador Mike Huckabee to disclose details about the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Concerns are mounting that GHF may be serving as a front for intelligence and political operations rather than solely humanitarian aid. The senators' letter criticizes the State Department's lack of transparency and oversight regarding GHF funding, especially given reports of nearly 1,000 Palestinian deaths near GHF sites. They also highlight GHF's alleged connections to the Israeli government and intelligence services, calling for an immediate halt to its funding and a transfer of resources to established aid organizations.</p>

This complaint follows YouTube's 2019 settlement with the FTC, which mandated content creators to designate videos as "made for kids" to prevent data collection and personalized ads.

          <p>In the three days since global genocide scholars accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, health officials in the Hamas-run territory reported at least 287 additional deaths, bringing the total to over 63,700 since October 2023. The International Association of Genocide Scholars cited the killing of 50,000 children and Israeli leaders' rhetoric as evidence. Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed these allegations, asserting that Hamas is the perpetrator of genocide. The article highlights the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza City, designated a "dangerous combat zone," and the fears of residents facing displacement, with many seeing no safe haven and the prospect of leaving their homes permanently.</p>

          <p>"Phantom energy," also known as vampire energy, refers to the electricity consumed by devices when they are plugged in but not actively in use, accounting for 5% to 10% of home energy use. This hidden drain contributes to climate change by increasing demand for electricity from emission-releasing sources. The article explains that smart devices, like internet-connected TVs, can be significant culprits, consuming up to 40 times more energy in standby mode than regular televisions. Experts recommend simple steps like unplugging chargers and unused appliances, or disabling smart features, to reduce emissions and save money, highlighting the collective impact of individual sustainable actions.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., grand juries have notably rejected multiple Justice Department requests for indictments in recent weeks, a highly unusual occurrence. Former federal prosecutors describe this as "exceptionally rare," suggesting a potential breakdown in the department's credibility with jurors. One prominent case involved Nathalie Rose Jones, accused of threatening President Trump on Instagram, whose indictment request was denied. Other rejections included cases of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent and interfering with an immigration transfer. The article highlights concerns from a D.C. U.S. Attorney about "politicized jury" and a "broken" system, while defense attorneys suggest jurors may disagree with the prosecution's theory of the cases.</p>

The FBI explicitly warns against using its data for city rankings due to numerous influencing variables like population density and economic conditions.

This article compares the affordability of Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, considering interest rates, repayment terms, and fees. While HELOCs currently offer slightly lower variable rates, home equity loans provide fixed rates and predictable payments. Experts note that a potential Federal Reserve rate cut could make HELOCs more attractive, but warn of payment increases if rates tick up.
