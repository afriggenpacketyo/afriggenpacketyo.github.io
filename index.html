          <p>Filmmaker Colin Hanks discussed the insensitive questioning John Candy endured about his weight during interviews, calling it "soul-crushing" and deeply inappropriate by today's standards. This pervasive issue is a central theme in Hanks' new documentary, "John Candy: I Like Me," which also delves into the late comedian's profound anxiety and his dedicated efforts to improve his health before his untimely death at 43. The article highlights how Candy's discomfort was palpable, as he constantly anticipated these personal questions. His son, Chris Candy, further revealed how intense paparazzi scrutiny significantly impacted his father's eating habits and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Martinsburg, West Virginia, a town heavily reliant on federal employment, is experiencing significant hardship due to the ongoing US government shutdown. Veterans like Jonathan Giba face extended waits for essential medical care, while other VA programs, crucial for job placement, have ceased. Federal workers, numbering over 3,300 in the area, are on unpaid leave or working without pay, impacting local small businesses and creating widespread anxiety. Residents express frustration over the political gridlock in Washington, highlighting the severe economic consequences for everyday Americans in this "Trump country" region, with thousands more layoffs threatened if the impasse continues.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump declared the war in Gaza concluded as he traveled to Israel for a hostage release under a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. He expressed confidence the ceasefire would hold and announced plans for a "Board of Peace" to oversee Gaza, which he described as a "demolition site." The agreement involves the exchange of 20 living Israeli hostages and remains of 28 others for approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees, alongside increased aid to the Strip. Trump is also set to co-chair an international peace summit in Egypt, aiming to finalize the comprehensive peace plan and normalize regional relations.</p>

          <p>A driver was arrested in Mason County, Washington, following a reckless pursuit that included driving the wrong way on State Route 3. Deputies observed the driver speeding through downtown Belfair and initiated a chase, which involved an unsuccessful Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT) and the eventual use of stop sticks to flatten the truck’s tires. The driver then abandoned the truck and fled on foot but was apprehended near E Krabbenhoft Road. He admitted to being under the influence of drugs, having a suspended license, and believing there was an arrest warrant for him, leading to multiple felony charges.</p>

          <p>Chinese entities acquiring land near sensitive US military bases are raising significant national security concerns, with former officials warning of potential espionage or even direct attacks. While Chinese ownership constitutes less than 1% of foreign-owned agricultural land, 29 states have already implemented laws to limit or ban such acquisitions. The Trump administration plans to enhance transparency and impose stricter penalties for false reporting, also highlighting the risk of Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining operations near strategic sites, which could be used for intelligence gathering or to sabotage critical infrastructure. This article emphasizes a growing, multifaceted threat to national security.</p>

          <p>Financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that today's AI-driven stock market exhibits worrying similarities to Wall Street before the 1929 crash, leading to the Great Depression. He describes a "new roaring 20s" with soaring stock prices potentially fueled by an unsustainable "sugar rush" of AI investment. Sorkin expresses anxiety about overheated markets and the erosion of post-1929 investor protections, such as less stringent SEC rules and a diminished Consumer Protection Bureau. He predicts an inevitable crash, though its timing and depth remain uncertain, urging caution as guardrails come off amidst increasing speculation and debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to objectively measure stress by detecting temperature drops in a person's nose, a physical response to altered blood flow. This non-invasive method, which turns the nose blue on thermal images during stress, could be a "game changer" for stress research. The article highlights its potential to monitor stress recovery, identify risk markers for anxiety or depression, and assess wellbeing in individuals unable to communicate, such as babies or great apes.

Lawyers claim the companies deceived consumers about their vehicles' environmental impact, leading to higher levels of harmful pollution. The trial's outcome, expected by summer 2026, could set a precedent for nine other carmakers facing similar allegations and determine compensation for affected motorists, potentially marking one of the most egregious breaches of corporate trust.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's foreign minister accused Russia of intentionally severing the external power line to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, allegedly to test reconnection with Moscow's power grid. This move is denounced as an "attempted theft" of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility, raising serious concerns about nuclear safety. The plant, currently not generating electricity, relies solely on emergency diesel generators for cooling fuel, with both sides blaming each other for the outage. The IAEA has repeatedly called on both sides to refrain from actions that compromise nuclear safety, highlighting the ongoing precarious situation.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Warns of New Stock Supply Risk to Market Rally, Not Just China Tensions</h2>

          <p>Jim Cramer identifies a brewing risk to the stock market rally, warning that a potential flood of new stock supply from speculative, unprofitable companies poses a greater threat than US-China trade tensions. He likens the current environment to the dot-com bubble of 2000, where retail enthusiasm for "Denizens of Sherwood Forest" stocks could lead to massive secondary offerings. Cramer advises caution on these highly-valued, loss-making firms, as such an influx of new shares could overwhelm demand, depress prices, and bleed into the broader market, creating widespread instability. He suggests investors should be wary of these speculative stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, demanding answers regarding the collapsed China spy case and accusing his government of being "too weak to stand up to Beijing." Charges against two men accused of spying for China were dropped because the Crown Prosecution Service could not obtain necessary evidence from the government referring to China as a national security threat. Badenoch questions the role of Starmer's national security advisor and alleges an appeasement of China, highlighting concerns about national security and governmental transparency.
