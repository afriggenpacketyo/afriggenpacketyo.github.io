          <p>China and the Philippines are embroiled in a dispute over Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands, with both countries asserting their sovereignty. The Chinese coastguard reported that it addressed six Filipinos who had illegally landed on the reef, while the Philippine coastguard stated its forces conducted maritime domain awareness exercises in the area. The incident follows a prior event where Chinese personnel planted a Chinese flag on the reef. This escalating situation underscores the ongoing tensions in the South China Sea and the competing claims to the region's resources and territories. Optimism score is 30.</p>
