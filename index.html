          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's births fell below 700,000 in 2024, marking a 5.7% decrease from the previous year, underscoring the growing trend of delayed marriages and childbirths. The total fertility rate also hit a record low of 1.15, down from 1.20 in 2023, as reported by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Both figures have declined for nine consecutive years, outpacing government projections by 15 years. While marriages saw a slight increase, deaths reached a postwar high, resulting in a record natural population decrease, highlighting the severity of Japan's demographic challenges.</p>

          <p>European companies are facing production halts due to Chinese government restrictions on the export of rare earth elements, which are vital for manufacturing smartphones and electric vehicles. These measures, seen as retaliation against US tariffs, have overwhelmed China's Ministry of Commerce with export applications. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China reports that some companies have already ceased production because of the delays. Rare earths, consisting of 17 elements, are subject to export controls imposed by Beijing, impacting European industries caught in the trade dispute.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, reigniting concerns about global trade wars and supply chain disruptions. This move increases import taxes on metals used in various products, from cars to canned goods. Critics argue that these protections could harm steel producers outside the U.S., provoke retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American consumers. While the UK has been granted an exemption, the EU and Canada are preparing retaliatory measures, and economists warn of potential job losses in manufacturing and construction sectors within the U.S.</p>

Surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders echoed Musk's sentiments, calling the bill an "abomination" because it provides tax breaks for the wealthy while cutting food aid for the poor. The bill aims to extend tax breaks from Trump's first term, partially financed by cuts in social benefits.</p>

One case involved an operation that went wrong, with the patient experiencing significant blood loss and complications, yet the death certificate attributed the death to pneumonia.

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's support for Nippon Steel's takeover bid of US Steel, workers remain wary of the deal's impact on their jobs and the industry. Trump claims the deal and increased tariffs will revitalize the steel industry, but workers emphasize the need for written commitments and express distrust of Nippon Steel's past trade law violations. Union leaders stress the importance of solidarity and binding agreements to protect workers' interests, while questioning the benefits for workers. Critics like Doug May, a former steel worker, view Trump's promises as a ploy to reward executives rather than support the workforce.</p>

These efforts are now further amplified by U.S. policies, which have inadvertently encouraged more scientists to consider opportunities in China.</p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to exclude the question of Palestine from the national school elections has ignited controversy, with critics arguing it undermines freedom of expression and democratic participation. The speakers of parliament justified the ban by deeming the issue too explosive for classroom deliberation, citing concerns about minority sensitivities and the complexity of the topic. However, critics argue that this decision contradicts Denmark's cultural model of democracy, which typically prioritizes controversial deliberation over protecting sensitivities. The controversy highlights a moral scandal in the West, where leaders selectively apply principles of human rights and international law.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team's choice not to call her to the witness stand in her murder trial is a strategic gamble. The prosecution played damaging interview clips, allowing the jury to hear Read's version of events, but without cross-examination.

The absence of her testimony leaves the prosecution's portrayal of her unchallenged, adding uncertainty to the trial's outcome, which previously resulted in a hung jury.</p>
