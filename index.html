          <p>Firefighters responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, were ambushed by an unknown gunman. The shots originated from the woods, prompting a significant law enforcement response and a shelter-in-place order for the surrounding area. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the fire was deliberately set as a trap to lure first responders to the scene. The FBI is now assisting local law enforcement in what is being handled as an active shooter situation.</p>

Despite a third-quarter surge from the Sparks, fueled by Emma Cannon's season-high 15 points, Chicago's strong fourth-quarter play proved decisive. The halftime ceremony celebrated Parker's legacy as her No. 3 jersey was raised to the rafters.</p>

A new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would increase the national debt by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade and cause 11.8 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage. The legislation, which faces a narrow path to passage, has created divisions within the Republican party, with President Trump pressuring lawmakers to support it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are conducting a nationwide crackdown on authors, predominantly young women, who write and publish gay erotic fiction, known as "danmei," on offshore platforms like Haitang. Dozens of writers have reportedly been arrested or questioned since February for allegedly violating China's anti-pornography laws, which are applied more stringently to homosexual content. The crackdown has sparked a rare online debate about censorship and outdated obscenity laws, though discussions are being actively censored by the state. The writers face both severe legal consequences and significant social stigma.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians living in or having escaped from Russian-occupied Mariupol are contradicting the positive narratives presented on Russian television. Residents describe a city still largely in ruins, with severe water shortages, frequent power cuts, and scarce, expensive essential goods like medicine. They also report that schools are being used to spread Russian propaganda, teaching a distorted version of history to Ukrainian children. Despite the risks, a secret resistance movement continues to operate, gathering intelligence and spreading pro-Ukrainian messages to maintain morale.</p>

          <p>A proposal to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from the Republican budget reconciliation bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced significant bipartisan opposition from lawmakers, conservation groups, and recreation advocates. Lee stated he withdrew the provision due to an inability to add safeguards preventing the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Conservationists celebrated the decision as a victory but remain vigilant about future threats to federal lands.</p>
