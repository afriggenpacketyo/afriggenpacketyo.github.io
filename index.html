          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 18:55:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of southern Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory. The quake occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, leading to evacuations in coastal towns like Seward as a precautionary measure. Officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but do not expect large, widespread inundation, as the event happened in shallow water. The region is part of the seismically active "Ring of Fire," and residents were urged to stay away from coastal areas until the advisory is lifted.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, has been fired by the Justice Department. Comey recently led the prosecution of Sean "Diddy" Combs and previously secured a conviction against Ghislaine Maxwell. As the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, her termination follows reports of President Trump's private frustration over her employment within his administration. This development is the latest significant change in leadership for the prominent prosecutor's office, which has seen several high-level departures in recent months.</p>

          <p>Former ESPN host Samantha Ponder has publicly detailed the circumstances of her firing, linking it to her social media support for female athletes competing against biological women. Ponder stated that after she shared posts about the issue, ESPN executives warned her against discussing the topic and misgendering individuals. She believes that while other factors may have contributed, the timing of her dismissal was almost certainly a result of her continued public stance on the matter. Ponder expressed that despite the controversial nature of her exit, she feels no bitterness and believes she should have spoken up sooner.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has been stalled in the House of Representatives for a second day due to internal opposition from conservative Republicans. Despite an intervention from President Trump to secure support, new objections arose regarding last-minute changes to the proposed legislation. The stalemate has cast doubt on the ability of the House to pass crypto-focused laws, including the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins. The legislative standstill is a setback for the crypto industry, which had anticipated significant progress during what was promoted as "Crypto Week." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's fundraising for his future presidential library is drawing criticism over the lack of transparency and regulation, prompting Senate Democrats to propose new legislation. The bill would cap individual donations at $10,000 during a president's term and require public disclosure, addressing concerns that special interests could use library donations to curry favor. This follows reports that millions from legal settlements and a gifted Boeing 747 from Qatar are being directed to the library fund. Historically, presidential library fundraising has been opaque, a concern that has been raised for past presidents from both parties.</p>

          <p>More than 20 children, ranging in age from two months to 13 years, have been placed in the custody of a California child-welfare agency amid an investigation into a Los Angeles-area couple. The couple, Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan, are the legal parents of all the children, most of whom were born via different surrogates around the country. The investigation began after an infant in their care was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly inflicted by a nanny. Several surrogate mothers have come forward stating they were misled and unaware the couple was simultaneously commissioning other pregnancies.</p>

          <h2>Half of Clergy Abuse Claims in New Orleans Archdiocese Bankruptcy Could Be Dismissed</h2>

          <p>In the bankruptcy case of the New Orleans Roman Catholic Archdiocese, investors are arguing that nearly half of the 633 clergy abuse claims could be thrown out. The church has agreed to a settlement trust of at least $180 million, but the eligibility of many claims, including those filed past a court deadline, is now being questioned. If a significant number of claims are dismissed, it could jeopardize the entire settlement, as a two-thirds approval from claimants is required. The outcome will determine whether the archdiocese resolves its bankruptcy or if victims must pursue their cases individually in civil court.</p>

          <p>President Trump's public statements regarding Jeffrey Epstein have shifted significantly over the years, creating a complex and sometimes contradictory record. In 2002, he called Epstein a "terrific guy," but after Epstein's 2019 arrest, Trump claimed he "wasn't a fan" and had a falling out with him years prior. He has also fueled conspiracy theories, suggesting Epstein may have been killed, while more recently dismissing the entire matter as a "Democratic hoax." This timeline of evolving comments provides context for the current backlash he faces from his own supporters over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>A landmark UK study has confirmed the success of a technique known as mitochondrial donation, resulting in the birth of eight healthy children free from devastating genetic disorders. The method involves combining the nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a female donor's egg, creating an embryo with genetic material from three people. This prevents the transmission of mitochondrial diseases, which are passed from mother to child and can be fatal. While hailed as a major breakthrough, the procedure remains controversial, with critics raising concerns about safety and the ethics of germline genetic modification.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after reports emerged that he had considered the move with Republican lawmakers. While acknowledging the discussions, Trump downplayed the possibility, a reversal that caused stock markets to rebound after an initial dip. The president has been openly critical of Powell for not lowering interest rates, calling him a "knucklehead." Dismissing a Fed chair would be a significant break with precedent and could undermine the central bank's political independence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has commended Beijing for making "big steps" to control the flow of illicit fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that has fueled a deadly crisis in the United States. This positive assessment marks a significant shift in tone from his previous statements, where he has often blamed China for the crisis and used it as a justification for imposing tariffs. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations continue between the two countries. Trump made the remarks while signing the HALT Fentanyl Act, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as highly controlled drugs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported five immigrants to the southern African nation of Eswatini, a country they are not from, signaling a ramp-up of controversial "third country" removals. The men, from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen, and Cuba, were described by DHS as individuals their home countries refused to accept due to serious criminal convictions. The move has drawn criticism as Eswatini is an absolute monarchy with a troubling human rights record, including reports of unlawful killings and torture by the government. This action follows a recent Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for the administration to expand such deportations.</p>
