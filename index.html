          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett revealed his plans to step down as CEO, naming Greg Abel as his successor effective January 1, 2026; Buffett will remain chairman. The market reacted with Class A shares falling 6.2% to around $760,000 and Class B shares similarly dropping to $506.12, both after hitting record highs. Analysts believe shareholders should be confident in the transition, expecting Buffett to continue mentoring Abel while providing guidance on major capital allocation decisions. This marks the end of Buffett's six-decade leadership, transforming Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague dismissed a case brought by Sudan accusing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of supporting genocide in the Darfur region. Sudan claimed the UAE violated the Genocide Convention by providing weapons to paramilitary forces in Darfur. However, the ICJ sided with the UAE, accepting its argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the case. This decision concludes the initial phase of the legal battle, with further developments expected as the situation in Darfur continues to unfold.</p>

The exhibition, inspired by Monica L. Miller's book, explores the use of fashion as a tool for Black people to assert power and identity from the time of enslavement to the present.

He remained at the Capitol during the storming by Trump supporters and presided over the certification of the election after the building was secured.

          <p>The Met Gala has raised a record $31 million, solidifying its position as a leading fundraising event for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. However, the lavish event comes with a seven-figure price tag, raising questions about its cost-effectiveness. This year's exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," marks the first fashion exhibition devoted entirely to designers of color, drawing a diverse array of celebrities. The gala's glamour often overshadows its role as a financial machine, with tickets costing up to $75,000 per person and tables starting at $350,000.</p>
