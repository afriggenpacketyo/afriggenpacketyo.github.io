          <p>The United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, confirming what President Trump called a "spectacular military success" aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities. The strikes involved B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles, with officials stating the action was not intended to pursue regime change. Iran acknowledged the attacks but claimed minimal impact, reserving the right to retaliate while international bodies like the IAEA reported no immediate increase in radiation levels. This action has triggered mixed reactions from US lawmakers and global leaders, highlighting the precarious state of affairs in the Middle East. Optimism remains uncertain amidst escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>In response to US airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran launched a series of missile attacks on Israel, resulting in multiple injuries and damage to buildings across several cities. Israeli defense forces reported that approximately 30 missiles were fired, impacting areas including Tel Aviv and Haifa, while searches were conducted for individuals trapped under collapsed structures. This retaliation marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, which began with Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites earlier in the month. The attacks have prompted heightened security measures and emergency responses in Israel, reflecting the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent nearly two decades in prison, with new evidence and re-examination of the case playing a pivotal role. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new testing revealed inconsistencies and issues with the original evidence, including DNA findings and blood spatter analysis. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office eventually recommended her conviction be overturned, citing the changed DNA evidence. While Dorotik's case was dismissed, unanswered questions remain, and she now advocates for systemic change within the justice system.</p>
