The charges stem from transporting undocumented migrants, including children, across the U.S.  A hearing is pending to determine whether he will remain detained pretrial. The prosecution's case hinges on a 2022 traffic stop and testimony from alleged co-conspirators, while the defense argues the government's evidence is insufficient to warrant pretrial detention.</p>
