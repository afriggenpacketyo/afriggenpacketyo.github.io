            <p>Pfizer has halted the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill, danuglipron, after a patient in a trial experienced a liver injury. The patient's liver enzymes recovered quickly after discontinuing the medication, but Pfizer decided to end the program after reviewing all clinical data and consulting with regulators. This setback adds to Pfizer's challenges in entering the competitive GLP-1 market, which is dominated by injectable medications from companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Pfizer remains committed to developing other weight loss drugs as analysts predict the GLP-1 industry could reach $150 billion by the early 2030s.</p>

            <p>Labour MP Tulip Siddiq has accused Bangladeshi authorities of conducting a "politically motivated smear campaign" after an arrest warrant was issued against her. The warrant stems from allegations that Siddiq illegally received land as part of a broader probe into the regime of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina. Siddiq's lawyers have stated that the allegations are false and have been addressed in writing to the Bangladeshi authorities, who never responded to their correspondence. The UK lists Bangladesh as a 2B extradition country, requiring clear evidence before extradition can be considered.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that over 60% of CEOs anticipate a recession in the next six months, fueled by growing concerns over tariffs. Approximately three-fourths of the surveyed CEOs believe tariffs will negatively impact their businesses in 2025. This apprehension is reflected in a significant drop in CEOs' views on current business conditions, reaching levels not seen since the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. While some CEOs foresee better business conditions in the coming year, a majority project increased costs and decreased profits. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Recent tariff flip-flops by the US president have caused uncertainty and volatility in financial markets, leading investors to dump US Treasury bonds. The article suggests that these actions, while intended to address perceived exploitation by trade partners, overlook the US's long-standing economic dominance and influence in setting global trade rules. The author argues that the US's economic success demonstrates that America's trade partners have failed to exploit the country. The constant changes in tariff policy create confusion and potentially harm businesses invested in international trade.</p>

            <p>Dutch exports to China experienced a significant drop in March, signaling that ASML Holding, a leading producer of semiconductor lithography equipment, has nearly cleared its backlog of orders from China. Restrictions imposed by the Dutch government, under pressure from the US, prohibit ASML from selling its most advanced equipment to Chinese buyers. The trend suggested Chinese buyers were stocking up on the equipment before such sales would be eventually outlawed due to Washington-enforced restrictions. ASML's CEO anticipates a return to more normal trade ratios with China in 2025 after a period of high revenue driven by backlog fulfillment.</p>

            <p>Airlines are increasingly relying on wealthier leisure travelers as economic clouds gather, with some carriers pulling back on growth plans due to weaker demand. Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines have adjusted their outlooks, citing a murky U.S. economic picture and slowing bookings, including corporate travel. While airlines are reducing capacity on off-peak domestic routes, they remain optimistic about expensive international routes and premium seating options. They are banking on wealthier consumers continuing to splurge on pricier seats despite global market turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US military aid to Ukraine is approaching its end, with Biden-era supplies running dry and Trump not approving new packages. This situation leaves Europe to consider how to support Ukraine with its own production, European aid, and US intelligence. Potential solutions include increased risk tolerance in donating equipment, directing resources to Ukraine's defense industry, securing air defense missiles through a deal with the US, and seizing Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine's defense. Putin is planning for this war to continue for at least months longer.</p>

            <p>A recent study indicates that even a small amount of exercise can significantly reduce the risk of developing dementia. The research, involving 10,000 people over two decades, found that "weekend warriors" who exercise once or twice a week were 25% less likely to develop mild dementia than those who don't exercise at all. Regular exercisers (at least three times a week) were 11% less likely to develop the condition. Researchers estimate that 13% of mild dementia cases could be avoided if middle-aged adults exercised at least once or twice a week.</p>

            <p>The article delves into the pervasive issue of maternal fatigue, highlighting that mothers often experience exhaustion despite getting sufficient sleep. Researchers suggest that poor sleep quality, sleep debt, and the overwhelming mental load of motherhood contribute to this phenomenon. Working mothers, in particular, struggle to find time for relaxation and mental rest. Experts recommend that busy mothers take a few minutes each day for "wakeful rest" to help reset their brains and combat fatigue.</p>

Merz indicated he would consider supplying Kyiv with the missiles as part of a wider support package with European allies. The Kremlin argues that such a stance will only lead to further escalation and that European capitals are not inclined to seek peace talks. Germany has been a main military backer of Ukraine, granting roughly 7.1 billion euros in military assistance in 2024 alone.</p>

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the case after the original ruling was rejected due to errors in the trial. </p>
