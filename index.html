          <p>Honda Motor reported a 50% drop in its first-quarter operating profit, falling short of analyst expectations primarily due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a stronger yen. Despite the profit decline, the company's revenue surpassed forecasts, and it raised its full-year profit outlook, anticipating a weaker yen and a reduced impact from tariffs. While its car sales fell globally, Honda's motorcycle division achieved a record quarterly profit, and electric vehicle sales in North America remained robust.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced a 67% surge in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, though the figure slightly missed analyst forecasts. The company is implementing cost-cutting measures and sharpening its commercial focus following a recent stock decline driven by weaker U.S. sales growth projections for Wegovy and its diabetes drug, Ozempic. Novo Nordisk faces mounting competition from compounded drug makers and rival Eli Lilly, as well as potential U.S. government pressure on drug pricing.</p>

          <p>The relationship between the United States and India has soured, shifting from pledges of a new trade agreement to public friction over tariffs and India's oil purchases from Russia. President Trump, who now labels India the "tariff king," has threatened substantial new levies, jeopardizing a partnership that has been strengthening for two decades. Analysts note that while India will prioritize its national interests, shared concerns over China are a foundational element of the U.S.-India relationship. However, the current trade disputes and accusations risk eroding the trust built between the two global partners.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun broadcasting a new series of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were dismissed following an investigation into their conduct. The decision to air the prerecorded series has drawn criticism, though the BBC stated it was the "right thing to do" for the contestants involved. The new episodes have been re-edited to minimize the hosts' presence and banter, and one contestant was removed at her own request. The controversy stems from upheld complaints against Wallace and Torode, which they have addressed publicly.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the eastern German city of Dresden have ordered the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people to facilitate the defusal of a 250-kilogram British bomb from World War II. The unexploded ordnance was discovered during demolition work on the Carola Bridge, which had partially collapsed. The evacuation zone includes hotels and the city's renowned Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), a major tourist landmark. This is the second such mass evacuation in Dresden this year, underscoring the persistent danger of unexploded bombs from the war even eight decades later.</p>

Tapper highlighted the president's tendency to create his own equations for jobs and poll numbers, often citing unsubstantiated data to support his actions while ignoring contradictory evidence. The segment specifically pointed to the recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, after Trump accused her of manipulating jobs data without providing any proof, following a disappointing employment report.</p>

The data, based on Ukrainian Air Force reports, shows a sharp escalation in munitions launched compared to the final six months of the previous administration. This increase has occurred even as the Trump administration twice paused military aid to Ukraine and Russia ramped up its domestic weapons production. The escalating attacks are straining Ukrainian air defenses and increasing civilian casualties.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return from the injured list, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 12-6 victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy's performance provided a much-needed spark for the Dodgers' offense, which had struggled significantly during the month he was sidelined with a knee injury. The game also saw positive contributions from other slumping hitters, including Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernández, who also hit two homers. Muncy's comeback serves as a major boost for the team's lineup down the stretch.</p>

          <p>A U.S. ban on live cattle imports from Mexico, prompted by concerns over the flesh-eating New World Screwworm parasite, is devastating ranchers in northern Mexico. The suspension, the third in eight months, has crippled an export business worth over $1.2 billion last year, compounding the effects of a severe two-year drought. Ranchers in the state of Sonora are being forced to sell cattle on the domestic market at a significant loss and diversify into other ventures to survive. The situation highlights the vulnerability of the cross-border agricultural economy to sanitary and environmental crises.</p>

Roa describes the desperate search and the danger the Abuelas faced, eventually finding her own granddaughter, Claudia, in 2000. Now 87, she vows to never give up the search for the nearly 300 grandchildren who remain missing, a legacy now being carried on by those who have been found.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country in the world, less than three months after announcing the lifting of long-standing sanctions. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the move is highly symbolic and threatens to hinder the country's potential for reconstruction after 13 years of devastating civil war. The steep tariffs are seen as a tool to maintain leverage over Syria's new transitional government. This policy could further destabilize the fragile nation, which is in urgent need of foreign investment and humanitarian support to prevent economic collapse.</p>

To overcome this, Qianfan is now turning to private rocket companies, recently issuing a tender for seven launches to deploy 94 satellites.
