          <p>President Trump suggested imposing a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, citing trade imbalances and difficult negotiations. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, complaining about trade barriers, VAT taxes, and lawsuits against American companies. The proposed tariffs would begin on June 1, 2025, with an exemption for products built or manufactured in the United States. This announcement immediately impacted stock futures, reflecting investor concerns about escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and the EU. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Apple must pay a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones not manufactured in the United States. Trump posted on Truth Social, directing his message to Apple CEO Tim Cook, emphasizing his expectation for iPhones sold in America to be produced domestically. Shares of Apple experienced a decline in premarket trading following the announcement. Some analysts estimate that moving iPhone production to the U.S. could increase the price of the smartphone significantly, with Wedbush estimating the cost of a U.S.-made iPhone at $3,500. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI employees are reportedly facing difficulties in donating their equity to charity despite the company's soaring valuation. Employees receive profit participation units (PPUs) that cannot be transferred without company approval, hindering their ability to make charitable donations. OpenAI has resisted loosening restrictions on equity transfers, citing the need to maintain control over the shareholder base. The company spokesperson stated that OpenAI is not singling out philanthropic donations, and is just practicing good governance. Equity donations via donor-advised funds (DAFs) are a major consideration at high-valued startups because salaries tend to be modest, and a significant portion of an employee's net worth is wrapped up in their options or stock holdings. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased from recent highs following President Trump's announcement of plans to escalate the trade war. Investors are worried about the potential impact of Trump's tax bill, which is expected to increase the fiscal deficit. Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating has further amplified these concerns, raising questions about the safety of U.S. Treasurys. The Supreme Court's suggestion of greater protection for Federal Reserve board members provided some positive news, easing fears about the potential removal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. </p>

          <p>Doctors in England are considering strike action after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems inadequate. The BMA argues that doctors' pay is significantly lower than it was 16 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Health unions reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, including nurses and midwives. While education unions generally welcomed the pay rise, they expressed concerns about partial government funding, which could lead to service cuts and job losses. </p>

          <p>India is emerging as a popular destination for LGBTQ+ tourism, driven by increasing inclusivity and interest from the hospitality sector. Companies like Indjapink and Pink Escapes are catering specifically to the LGBTQ+ tourism market, offering tailored experiences. According to the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association (IGLTA), India has made significant strides in creating a more inclusive environment for the LGBTQ+ community. While same-sex marriage is not yet legally recognized, the decriminalization of homosexuality in 2018 has signaled a broader cultural shift toward acceptance. </p>
