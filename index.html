          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, impacting over 8,000 individuals who were granted work permits and deportation reprieve due to unsafe conditions in Afghanistan. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that Afghanistan's improved security and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return, a claim contested by advocates citing ongoing human rights abuses and economic collapse since the Taliban takeover in 2021. This decision contrasts with the Biden administration's extension of TPS for Afghanistan, which acknowledged the humanitarian crisis and security threats. The move has been criticized by groups aiding Afghan relocation, who argue it will have lasting negative effects.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams addressed the federal corruption case against him, explaining his use of seven different phone numbers as necessary for separating official, personal, and campaign communications, which he states is common practice among New Yorkers. Adams also claimed that the FBI's tactics, including seizing his devices at the 2023 New York City Marathon finish line, were intended to humiliate him, and that his dyslexia prevented him from remembering his primary phone's password. Documents from the case revealed the FBI tracked Adams' location using cellphone data, leading them to seek permission to use a "cell site simulator" to identify other devices he might be using. The charges against Adams were eventually dismissed after the Trump administration intervened.</p>

          <p>The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and several teams within the agency have been reinstated after facing layoff notices, reversing previous cuts to worker safety programs. This reversal comes ahead of congressional hearings with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs. The reinstatements include staff in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. The move will allow NIOSH to resume critical functions such as approving N95 respirators and conducting workplace health risk investigations, though many workers at other CDC divisions remain laid off.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods, resulting from recent talks, are prompting Chinese auto-parts makers to reassess their plans to build production facilities in the US. The US agreed to lower its combined tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30 per cent for 90 days after talks in Geneva, providing a temporary cooling of trade tensions. Despite the reduction, uncertainty remains as the tariffs may jump again after 90 days, making it difficult for Chinese vendors and American customers to strike deals. China shipped almost 100 billion yuan worth of auto parts to the US in 2024, and while American clients still demand these goods, the fluctuating tariff landscape clouds overseas expansion plans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration can invoke the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport criminal illegal immigrant members of the Venezuelan Tren De Aragua gang, although adequate prior notice must be given to those subject to removal. The ruling, confined to Venezuelan aliens who are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents, 14 years or older, and have been specifically designated as part of a Foreign Terrorist Organization, conflicts with other rulings challenging the administration's deportation efforts. Trump issued an executive order on March 14 invoking the AEA regarding the invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua, leading to this legal challenge.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to Iranian officials. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, suggesting a consortium where Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade for civilian use in other Arab countries. This plan aims for permanence, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would involve on-the-ground oversight from representatives of participating countries, including possibly the United States. President Trump has expressed a desire for a deal with Iran to enhance regional safety, but warned that time is limited for Iranian leaders to decide.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office claims that President Trump's tariff policies will reduce state revenues by $16 billion through next year. Despite personal income tax and corporate tax receipts exceeding projections, the Newsom administration predicts overall revenues will be lower due to the economic impact of Trump's tariffs. Newsom is expected to project a deficit for California in the year ahead, citing rising Medi-Cal costs and his policy to provide free healthcare coverage to low-income undocumented immigrants. California has filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump lacks the authority to impose tariffs and will seek a preliminary injunction to freeze the tariffs in federal court.</p>

The administration's focus on white Afrikaners, who claim racial discrimination, contrasts with its broader ban on most refugees and its targeting of legal and illegal immigrants for deportation.

          <p>A team of researchers in China has cautioned against the rapid adoption of DeepSeek's AI in hospitals, citing clinical safety and privacy risks associated with the cost-efficient open-source models. At least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek's large language models (LLMs) for clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek's tendency to generate "plausible but factually incorrect outputs" could lead to "substantial clinical risk," despite its strong reasoning capabilities. They also expressed concerns that healthcare professionals could become overreliant on or uncritical of DeepSeek’s output, leading to diagnostic errors or treatment biases.</p>

          <p>Mariangela Hungria, a microbiologist from Brazil, has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long work on identifying bacteria in soil that can boost crop harvests. Hungria's research focuses on isolating useful strains of bacteria called rhizobia, which inhabit nodules on soybean roots, capture nitrogen from the air, and convert it into a form that feeds the plant. Her work has contributed to Brazil becoming an agricultural superpower, and microbial treatments are now widely used on major crops like soybeans and corn in Brazil. Hungria plans to use the $500,000 prize to fund a new award recognizing women working in agriculture, microbiology, communications, or for the benefit of people with special needs.</p>

          <p>Under the direction of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the FDA is seeking to remove prescription fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing concerns about the impact of ingested fluoride on the human microbiome. The FDA claims that ingested fluoride changes the human microbiome in a concerning way, even though the research it cites is inconclusive. This move contradicts recommendations from the CDC, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and professional medical associations, which recommend low doses of fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water. Critics argue this action removes a choice for medical providers and could harm oral health.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill to fund his agenda aims to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. Despite Trump's promises, the bill proposes work requirements for recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $715 billion over the next decade but would also leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. Trump has countered that his administration is looking for "fraud" and "abuse" in the benefits program.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, reflecting price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The CPI reading for April was the lowest level since February 2021, with housing costs being a major driver of inflation. Economists are watching for signs that President Trump's tariffs are impacting American households, though the impact may not be evident in economic data for a few months. The Federal Reserve is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth. Because of the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S., inflation may not rise as much as earlier anticipated.</p>
