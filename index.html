          <p>Shares of bitcoin miner and data center operator TeraWulf surged over 10% following an announcement that Google increased its stake in the company. This deal raises Google's stake from 8% to 14% and provides up to $1.4 billion in additional financial backstop, bringing the total to about $3.2 billion. The investment is intended to fund the expansion of TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility in New York for advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure. This news follows a recent spike in stock value after the company signed two 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills has significantly increased contraceptive use among people who previously used no method or less effective ones. Researchers found that nearly a third of individuals using the OTC pill, Opill, had previously used no contraception at all. The study highlights that users of the non-prescription pill were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and live in rural areas, suggesting it successfully reduces barriers to access. Experts believe this increased accessibility is a crucial tool for reproductive autonomy.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner humorously recounted her "vile" experience filming a kissing scene with her former "Game of Thrones" co-star, Kit Harington, for their new horror film, "The Dreadful." Turner explained on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" that their close bond, having played siblings for years, made the romantic scenes incredibly awkward. She recalled that after she suggested Harington for the role, he pointed out the script's romantic elements, which she had overlooked. On set, both actors reportedly felt like retching during their first kissing scene due to their brother-sister-like relationship off-screen.</p>

          <h2>Workers Embrace 'Job Hugging' as Economic Uncertainty Curbs Job-Hopping Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:31:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend dubbed "job hugging" is replacing the "great resignation," as workers are increasingly choosing to stay in their current roles due to economic uncertainty. The rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level since early 2016, reflecting nervousness about the labor market. This shift is attributed to a cooling job market, higher interest rates, and slower job growth, which has reduced confidence among job seekers. While providing stability, experts warn that "job hugging" can lead to stagnant wage growth and skill development for employees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advocate for dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a straightforward method for investors to leverage the power of compound interest. Instead of receiving cash payouts, a DRIP automatically uses dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock, including fractional shares. This passive strategy is particularly beneficial for long-term investors who may not actively manage their portfolios, as it ensures their money is consistently working for them. Historical data shows this approach can lead to substantially higher total returns over time compared to simply collecting cash dividends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats have returned to the state capitol, ending a two-week quorum break that had halted legislative proceedings. The lawmakers left the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional district maps mid-decade, a move that could give the GOP up to five additional U.S. House seats. With their return, the Republican majority can now resume its push for the new maps, which Democrats have vowed to challenge in court, calling them discriminatory. This development is part of a larger national political battle, with Democratic-led states like California considering their own redistricting efforts in response.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that the best age for a senior to take out a reverse mortgage depends on individual circumstances, including health, income needs, and long-term financial goals. Generally, waiting until one's early 70s is often recommended, as older borrowers typically qualify for larger loan amounts and have a clearer picture of their retirement needs. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without making monthly payments, but it reduces the equity left for heirs. It can be a useful tool to supplement retirement income or delay taking Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

He was known for his welcoming tone toward the LGBTQ community and his criticism of global financial systems, earning him the title "the People's Pope." His tenure was marked by efforts to make the Church more inclusive and address modern challenges, though he also faced criticism from conservatives.</p>

          <p>The German Foreign Ministry has confirmed that 211 Afghans who had been granted resettlement rights in Germany were deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan. These individuals, including human rights defenders and former local staff for German institutions, had fled to Pakistan after the Taliban takeover and were awaiting transfer. Germany is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to try and facilitate their return to Pakistan. The deportations are part of a broader crackdown by Pakistan on Afghan refugees, affecting thousands who are still waiting for promised relocation to Western countries.</p>

          <p>New York City police reopened Times Square to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic after a temporary closure on Monday morning. The area was shut down for approximately 90 minutes while authorities investigated a report of a suspicious device near West 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue. The closure created an unusual calm in the normally bustling hub of Midtown Manhattan, with police cordoning off several blocks. After a thorough investigation, the area was deemed safe and normal activity was allowed to resume around noon.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is rebranding to MS NOW and will no longer use the iconic NBC peacock logo. The change is part of a larger corporate restructuring where MSNBC, along with other channels like CNBC and USA, will be spun off from parent company Comcast's NBC Universal into a new entity called Versant. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the network. The move comes nearly 30 years after the channel's founding as a partnership between Microsoft (MS) and NBC.</p>

          <p>Several European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, traveled to Washington to participate in talks between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy. Their primary goal is to prevent a U.S.-brokered peace deal that they fear could amount to capitulation by Ukraine and undermine long-term European security. The visit was prompted by concerns that Trump, following a meeting with Vladimir Putin, has softened his stance by dropping calls for a ceasefire as a precondition for talks. European officials aim to ensure any security guarantees extend to the entire continent.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared the ongoing strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants to be illegal and has ordered them to return to work immediately. The ruling came after the union defied a previous government order to end the job action, which began on Saturday and has disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers. The union and the airline have been in negotiations for eight months, with pay and compensation for on-ground work being major points of contention. It remains unclear what consequences the union will face if it continues to defy the board's order.</p>

          <p>As discussions continue regarding international support for Ukraine, an analysis of aid commitments reveals key financial details. According to the Kiel Institute, a German think tank, the United States has committed a total of $130.6 billion to Ukraine between January 2022 and June 2025. In contrast, European nations combined have contributed a larger sum of $165.7 billion over the same period, which includes military, financial, and humanitarian assistance. While the U.S. remains the largest single-country donor, the data contradicts claims that America's financial support vastly outweighs that of its European allies.</p>

This price is less than half of the drug's monthly list price of nearly $1,350 and is aimed at those without insurance coverage. The move comes amid increasing political pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs in the U.S. and follows a similar price reduction for its weight-loss drug, Wegovy. This strategy is also intended to make the branded medication more accessible and compete with cheaper, unregulated compounded versions.</p>
