          <p>South African authorities have arrested nearly 1,000 undocumented foreign migrants working illegally at the Sheba Gold Mine in the Mpumalanga province. The operation, which took almost a week, targeted the widespread issue of illegal mining, known locally as "zama-zamas," in a country with thousands of abandoned mines. Police stated that some of those detained may be underage and will face charges for immigration violations and illegal mining. The mine's owner welcomed the arrests, highlighting the persistent problems of gold theft and the dangers associated with unregulated mining activities.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza's Health Ministry, at least 325 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces over the past week while attempting to access scarce food aid. This occurs amid a worsening humanitarian crisis that UN-backed experts describe as a famine, with deaths from malnutrition rising. Israel's military has stated its troops only fired warning shots in some incidents, while aid agencies report that armed gangs loot most supplies before distribution. The crisis has prompted international condemnation and a visit from a US envoy, though critics have called the visit a superficial attempt to manage public opinion.</p>

          <p>Mel Owens, the new star of "The Golden Bachelor," is addressing public criticism after stating he requested female contestants be between the ages of 45 and 60. The 66-year-old former NFL player explained his preference was based on his personal dating frame of reference, as he had not watched the show and was unaware of its typical age range. Owens said he apologized to the contestants as soon as filming began, calling his comments "unfair" and "insensitive." The article notes that he faced a "brutal" roast from the contestants during a group date, indicating the controversy became a central theme early in the season.</p>

          <p>Following former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to run for California governor, the race has been thrown wide open with no obvious front-runner. Candidates like former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are now jockeying for position, but political strategists note that none currently possess statewide name recognition. The focus now shifts to fundraising, key endorsements, and the candidates' ability to build their profiles across the state. With the Democratic donor base no longer waiting on Harris, the coming months will be critical in determining who can build the momentum needed to stand out in the crowded field.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 15:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has climbed to €3,248, a sum that is increasingly unaffordable for many retirees and is straining the nation's long-term care insurance system. This dramatic rise is attributed to higher wages for nursing staff and an increase in staffing levels, but it means residents must now cover significant out-of-pocket expenses. With Germany's population aging, the system is nearing a breaking point, prompting calls for urgent reforms. Proposed solutions include injecting tax revenue into the system or increasing contributions from higher-income individuals to ensure its long-term viability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it has opened an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into President Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency that enforces restrictions on political activities by government employees but cannot bring criminal charges. Since Smith is no longer a government employee, the potential repercussions of the investigation are unclear, though its findings could be referred to the Department of Justice.</p>

Speakers emphasized the need to combat ongoing racism and properly enforce laws against hate speech, connecting the historical tragedy to current political extremism.

In contrast, the Home Secretary described the award as a "clear signal of our gratitude," noting it is above the current inflation rate.

Earlier, India built a commanding lead of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and surprise half-centuries from Akash Deep and Washington Sundar. Despite the setback, England remains hopeful, as batting conditions have improved significantly, setting up a tense and decisive final two days of the series.</p>

The deal, which includes a player option for the final year, solidifies the 26-year-old as the franchise's cornerstone for the post-LeBron James era. Since arriving in a blockbuster trade from Dallas, Doncic has embraced his role, even helping recruit key free agents this summer. The extension comes as Doncic has made a visible commitment to improving his physical conditioning, signaling his dedication to bringing another championship to Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the Gothamist has reportedly found that over 50 signatures on New York City Mayor Eric Adams's petition to run as an independent were fraudulent, including some from deceased individuals. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the integrity of the petitioning process. The campaign stated it expects the contractors it hired to follow the law and will conduct its own review. The report adds another layer of complexity to the mayoral race, which includes several high-profile candidates running as independents alongside the major party nominees.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week as a series of major economic and political events kept investors on edge. The S&P 500 ended a two-week winning streak after a surprisingly weak July jobs report revived expectations for a September interest rate cut, just days after the Federal Reserve held rates steady. President Trump reacted to the data by firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and also announced new "reciprocal" tariff rates on trade partners like Canada. The week was further complicated by a flood of corporate earnings and a sudden resignation from a Federal Reserve governor, contributing to significant market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain, running in 15 tries in a lopsided match at Welford Road. The win, however, was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer for a clumsy clearout in the second half. The incident means Packer may miss some of England's opening matches at the upcoming Rugby World Cup, pending a disciplinary review. Despite the comfortable win, which showcased England's depth and power, the potential suspension of their captain is a significant concern as they finalize preparations for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO, have uncovered a major corruption scheme involving the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems at inflated prices. According to the agencies, a sitting lawmaker, officials, and national guard personnel were caught taking bribes and receiving kickbacks of up to 30% of a contract's value. This announcement came just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following large public protests against a government move to curb their powers.

Data shows Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers, a public health crisis that advocates are addressing by providing accessible lessons and scholarships. By creating more Black swimmers, these groups also hope to foster a new generation of Black lifeguards and instructors, making aquatic spaces safer and more inclusive for all.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, a first for the state. This growth is not driven by rooftop panels but by large-scale projects from utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on favorable economics and streamlined state regulations for development. With natural gas prices rising, solar has become the cheaper option for new power generation. However, the industry faces headwinds from the federal rollback of tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid, which requires significant investment in storage and infrastructure to maintain momentum.
