          <h2>Major Retailers Adopt Diverse Strategies to Counter Tariff Impacts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 12:29:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three prominent retailers—Five Below, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Best Buy—are employing varied strategies to mitigate the financial impact of new tariffs, reflecting their distinct business models and customer bases. Abercrombie & Fitch, despite diversifying its supply chain, anticipates a substantial $90 million tariff hit, tightening its annual profit forecast. Best Buy, less reliant on China, front-loaded freight in June, while discount retailer Five Below, with high exposure to Chinese tariffs, leverages its inventory flexibility and opportunistic purchasing to manage costs. These differing approaches highlight how companies navigate global trade policies, with experts predicting tariffs will be a bigger headwind in the latter half of the year, with the ultimate impact on consumer price sensitivity remaining a key unknown.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 12:27:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced an increase in the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags, raising it from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag starting in November. O'Leary defended the policy, stating it aims to deter a small minority of passengers from violating bag size limits and ensure faster boarding and fewer flight delays across its European network. Despite an upcoming EU rule change increasing standard carry-on dimensions, the airline maintains strict adherence to its size and weight policies, charging up to £75 for non-compliant bags. O'Leary emphasized that 99.9% of its 200 million passengers comply, and the measure is not intended to "catch people out" but to enforce rules, thereby improving overall operational efficiency and passenger experience.</p>

          <p>An 8-year-old and a 10-year-old were tragically killed, and 17 others, including 14 children, were injured in a mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis during a morning Mass. The assailant, described as a man in his early 20s, fired dozens of rounds through church windows from a rifle, shotgun, and pistol before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Police Chief Brian O’Hara labeled it a "deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping," with investigators actively seeking a motive. This horrific incident during the first week of school has left the community devastated, with officials like Mayor Jacob Frey expressing profound sorrow and emphasizing the need for peace in places of learning and worship.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth in Q2, with sales falling 5%, yet achieved overall growth of 7% due to the exceptional performance of its Hollister brand, which surged by 19%. This strong showing allowed the company to narrowly surpass Wall Street's top and bottom-line expectations and raise its full-year revenue outlook to 5-7% growth. However, the retailer also tightened its earnings outlook, now anticipating a substantial $90 million net tariff cost, nearly double previous estimates, impacting its operating margin. CEO Fran Horowitz expressed confidence in the Abercrombie brand's return to growth by year-end, driven by new categories and strategic partnerships like the NFL, aiming to sustain relevance and sales in a competitive market.

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares rose significantly, recovering previous losses, after the company announced it would abandon its recently introduced logo and revert to its traditional design. The decision followed widespread criticism from social media users and even President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the company to "go back to the old logo, admit a mistake." The proposed redesign, which removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" character and "Old Country Store" phrase, was widely panned as "generic" and "soulless," with a YouGov poll indicating 76% of Americans preferred the old one. The company stated it listened to customer feedback, reaffirming its commitment to its core values and country hospitality, leading to a positive market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reportedly suspended over 20 staff members who signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's drastic overhauls, funding cuts, and alleged interference within the agency. The letter warned of potential "national catastrophe" risks akin to Hurricane Katrina, highlighted concerns over workforce reductions, and perceived "censorship of climate science." FEMA defended its reforms, calling the suspended employees "bureaucrats" resistant to change, asserting its focus on disaster survivors over "broken systems." These suspensions, described as administrative leave, occur amid renewed scrutiny of US disaster readiness following recent deadly flooding in Texas and an expected busier hurricane season due to climate change.</p>

Lebanese journalists condemned his remarks as reflecting "an ingrained colonial arrogance" and a "hollow, patronizing mentality," demanding a public apology and calling for a boycott of his future events.

County Chief Fire Officer Jonathan Dyson described the situation as a "significant wildfire," forcing a "very defensive fire-fighting strategy" and requiring national assistance to manage the spread.

          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, comes with significant and permanent financial risks, despite its appeal for early retirement or immediate income. This decision results in a permanent reduction of monthly benefits, approximately 70% of the full retirement age amount, which also diminishes future cost-of-living adjustments. Furthermore, it means foregoing delayed retirement credits, which could increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, and can also reduce potential survivor benefits for a spouse. The article suggests strategies like tapping retirement savings, considering annuities, or working part-time to delay claiming and maximize benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

While acknowledging the importance of engaging with US presidents as an ally, Davey stated his boycott aims to highlight Trump's personal responsibility for achieving peace and ensuring the suffering in Gaza is not overlooked amidst the diplomatic pomp.

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novartis warned that NHS patients in the UK could lose access to cutting-edge treatments due to skyrocketing costs and an ongoing dispute over drug pricing deals, with talks breaking down last week. Novartis claims the UK market is "largely uninvestable" because of high rebate rates, which have risen to 23.5% compared to 7% in Germany, and outdated assessment methods by NICE that have not kept pace with inflation since 1999. Health Secretary Wes Streeting accused pharma firms of being "short-sighted," vowing not to let them "rip off" taxpayers. The company has already withheld several medicines from the UK, and fears future launches and research investments could be further deprioritized, impacting patient access to vital new therapies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Frum's podcast, featuring classicist Mary Beard, discusses the pervasive misuse of history in contemporary politics, particularly the polemical comparisons often drawn between modern societies and ancient Rome. Beard cautions against cherry-picking historical analogies, emphasizing that while Rome offers lessons, direct comparisons are often flawed due to vast differences in societal structures, knowledge, and economic understanding. The discussion highlights how modern fascism thrives on identifying enemies and cultural flashpoints, using the recent Cracker Barrel logo controversy as an example. Both argue that understanding history accurately, alongside upholding liberty and equality, is crucial for confronting modern challenges, with humor serving as a potent short-term tool against absurdity.</p>

          <p>Patients using the weight-loss drug Mounjaro are struggling to obtain their prescriptions, with many worried about health impacts, ahead of a significant price increase by manufacturer Eli Lilly on September 1. Eli Lilly, which announced a price rise of up to 170% as the drug was "significantly below" prices in other European countries, has asked UK distributors to halt new pharmacy orders to prevent "inappropriate stockpiling." Pharmacies are prioritizing existing patients, expecting supplies to normalize in early September. The National Pharmacy Association urged patients to avoid bulk buying and unlicensed sellers, while some NHS patients with type 2 diabetes, who rely on the drug, also report difficulties accessing the crucial medication, highlighting the widespread concern.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has implemented a sweeping global program of tariffs, which are taxes charged on imported goods, arguing they boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit by countering "cheaters." Tariffs typically add a percentage to a product's value, with companies often passing these increased costs to consumers or importing fewer goods, impacting the US inflation rate. Trump's policy, often volatile and used as a negotiating tactic, has caused global economic chaos, leading the IMF and OECD to downgrade global growth predictions. The article details specific tariffs on goods like steel and cars, and on countries like India and Vietnam, alongside the administration's broader demands for trade partners to address migration and illegal drugs.

This development, first reported by The New York Times, follows a similar inability to indict another individual, Sidney Reid, for allegedly assaulting an FBI agent, leading to misdemeanor charges. The D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office technically has 30 days from Dunn's arrest to seek an indictment or must opt for misdemeanor offenses or drop the case under the federal Speedy Trial Act. The White House had previously publicized Dunn's arrest with a "public relations blitz," even releasing a video of heavily armed agents, despite his attorney's prior offer for a willing surrender.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a bizarre armored dinosaur, *Spicomellus afer*, in Morocco, dating back 165 million years. This "punk rocker" of its time, as described by Professor Richard Butler, is the oldest known ankylosaur and features unique meter-long spikes fused directly onto its bone, a characteristic unseen in any other animal, living or extinct. This discovery challenges existing theories on ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these dinosaurs might have initially developed elaborate armor for display during the Jurassic period, later co-opting it for defense against large predators in the Cretaceous. Researchers estimate the four-meter-long, one-meter-high creature weighed around two tonnes, with its unique features prompting a rethinking of armored dinosaur development.</p>
