          <p>During his sentencing, a federal judge stated that musician Sean Combs has not demonstrated genuine remorse or taken full responsibility for his prostitution-related crimes. Prosecutors argued for a significant prison sentence, highlighting the violence involved beyond just transportation for prostitution, while the defense sought to portray his actions as part of a reckless lifestyle. The judge noted that while sentencing guidelines suggest 5-7 years, he retains discretion and will consider acquitted conduct as relevant context for the crimes of which Combs was convicted. The hearing proceeded without victim impact statements after a witness withdrew.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, both Google and Apple have removed applications from their app stores that allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The move came after Attorney General Pam Bondi demanded Apple take down the 'ICEBlock' app, citing safety risks to law enforcement officers. This action was amplified after it was revealed a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility had used a similar app. The app's creator defended his work, stating it was designed to help immigrants and draw parallels to historical persecution, not to incite violence.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a farm in Ukraine's Kharkiv region ignited a massive fire, leading to the death of approximately 13,000 pigs. The strike, which injured one farm worker, is part of a broader Russian assault targeting Ukraine's natural gas and energy infrastructure ahead of winter. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack as deliberate terror against civilian facilities with no military purpose, aimed at disrupting the heating season. Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed its forces successfully hit designated military-industrial and supporting energy infrastructure targets across Ukraine.</p>

The session was disrupted by two red flags caused by separate crashes involving Mercedes' George Russell and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson. Despite the on-track incidents, drivers like Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso reported positive progress with their car setups. The disrupted running meant teams could not complete their usual race simulations, leaving the competitive order uncertain ahead of qualifying.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has seen record sales of all-electric vehicles in the first nine months of the year, surpassing one million units sold. This surge was driven by consumers rushing to purchase EVs before the expiration of federal incentives of up to $7,500. Tesla maintained its market leadership, though its share decreased to 43.1% as competitors like General Motors gained significant ground, reaching a 13.8% market share. Analysts anticipate a potential drop in EV sales now that the federal credits have ended, a policy change resulting from the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

          <p>Pediatricians are experiencing increasing financial strain and disincentives to offer vaccines, challenging claims that immunizations are highly profitable for them. Doctors face significant upfront costs to purchase and store vaccines, with very slim reimbursement margins and high risks of financial loss from spoilage or unused doses. The Trump administration's anti-vaccine rhetoric and policy changes have created unpredictable demand and insurance coverage issues, particularly for COVID-19 shots. This uncertainty is compelling some practices to order fewer vaccines or stop offering certain ones, potentially worsening workforce shortages and impacting public health.</p>

The plan also outlines a future for Gaza governed by a technocratic committee, with oversight from an international body led by Trump.

          <p>An increasing number of Americans are facing prolonged periods of joblessness as the U.S. labor market shows signs of slowing down. The share of long-term unemployed individuals, those out of work for 27 weeks or more, has risen to 26%, the highest in over three years. Workers with extensive experience and recent college graduates alike are struggling, often submitting hundreds of applications with little success.

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently convened a secret meeting with around 800 senior military leaders, delivering a partisan speech that has intensified concerns about the politicization of the armed forces. During the address, Trump threatened to dismiss generals who disagree with him and suggested deploying the military in major U.S. cities, framing it as a "war from within." While some military insiders were relieved that no immediate purges or loyalty pledges occurred, the event was widely seen as using top commanders as a backdrop for a political rally, blurring the lines between military service and partisan politics.</p>

          <p>A review of Taylor Swift's 12th album, "The Life of a Showgirl," suggests that despite its pop production by Max Martin, the work conveys a sense of weariness and burnout. The article argues that while Swift has achieved immense success, the album's themes of rivalry and cynicism lack the passion and novelty of her previous work. The songwriting is described as resting on familiar tricks and crasser lyrics, failing to convincingly sell the fairy tale of finding happiness. Ultimately, the album is portrayed as the sound of an overworked entertainer who has reached the pinnacle of her career only to find it a charmless chore.</p>

Worshippers and security staff were praised for their bravery in preventing the attacker from entering the building, an act which likely prevented a much larger catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who has worked in the Atlanta area for two decades after fleeing El Salvador, was deported after being held in ICE custody for 100 days. His detention began after he was arrested on minor charges, which were quickly dismissed, while he was livestreaming a protest. Press freedom organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists condemned his prolonged imprisonment and deportation, arguing it represents a threat to media freedoms in the U.S. They contend that the government's actions create a chilling effect on journalists, particularly those covering law enforcement and immigration issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tactical analysis of Florian Wirtz's initial performances at Liverpool suggests his underwhelming start is due to being used in a sub-optimal role rather than poor play. The £116m signing is yet to score or assist, but he has been tasked with dropping deeper to aid in build-up play, a responsibility that reduces his time near the opposition's goal. The article posits that the intensity of the Premier League and the team's physically demanding style have also contributed to his struggles. To optimize his talent, Liverpool may need to adjust their tactics to allow Wirtz more opportunities in advanced positions with space to create.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Bedouin community of Umm al-Khair in the occupied West Bank is facing heightened fear and intimidation following the killing of a resident by a notorious Israeli settler. The settler, Yinon Levi, who was released after claiming self-defense, has repeatedly returned to the village with construction equipment to establish a new illegal outpost, further encroaching on Palestinian land. This activity, protected by Israeli forces, has intensified since the fatal shooting, leaving villagers feeling trapped and powerless.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago transit system improvement projects. The Department of Transportation attributed the freeze to the ongoing government shutdown, which it blamed on Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. The administration claims the shutdown has slowed a review to ensure the projects do not involve "unconstitutional practices" related to race or gender in contracting. This action follows similar funding freezes for projects in New York and climate-related initiatives in states won by Democrats, escalating the political battle over the shutdown.</p>

Her termination is part of a broader series of firings and budget cuts across the Department of Health and Human Services, which critics say is decimating federal health research.</p>

          <p>A weakening U.S. labor market is disproportionately affecting recent college graduates, with many struggling to find their first full-time jobs despite holding degrees and internship experience. Federal data indicates that the unemployment rate for new workforce entrants has reached a nine-year high, and the traditional advantage of a bachelor's degree in the job market is diminishing. This trend is attributed to a "low-hiring" environment and a surplus of degree-holders, forcing many young adults to move back home with their parents and question the value of their education in the current economic climate.</p>

The case is the first of its kind in the UK to establish paternity through commercially available DNA databases when fathers were otherwise unknown. This legal victory now enables the offspring to apply for British citizenship. The ruling highlights the long-term consequences for local communities near the British Army Training Unit in Kenya and may encourage more individuals in similar situations to seek legal recourse.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Shanti Nelson reflects on the sudden and powerful realization at age 55 that she will never have children. She describes this confrontation with finality as a new form of grief, distinct from mourning the loss of her parents but connected to the absence of a maternal bond she will never experience. The author grapples with feelings of remorse for not having actively planned for children, attributing it to naively assuming it would just happen. The piece explores the emotional turbulence of menopause and the process of accepting an unplanned, childless future in midlife.</p>

Speaking at an event, he compared the situation to past bubbles like the dot-com era but emphasized that the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide "gigantic" benefits to society. Bezos argued that while many AI ventures will fail, the intense period of investment and experimentation will lead to significant, lasting innovations from the eventual winners, similar to advancements that emerged from the biotech bubble.
