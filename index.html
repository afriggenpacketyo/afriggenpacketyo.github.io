          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant surge, rising by more than 4%, due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Brent crude futures increased to $69.77 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude reached $68.15. The U.S. is preparing a partial evacuation of its embassy in Iraq because of heightened security risks, and the UK Maritime Trade Operations warned of increased regional tensions that could lead to military activity. President Trump expressed diminished confidence in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, further fueling market anxieties. The optimism score reflects the instability and potential for conflict in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his sexual assault retrial, Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley, but the jury acquitted him of a similar charge regarding Kaja Sokola. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third-degree sexual assault charge involving Jessica Mann, leading the judge to instruct them to continue deliberations. The retrial stemmed from accusations by Haley, Mann, and Sokola, with the verdict coming after days of tense deliberations among the jurors. Weinstein's initial 2020 conviction was overturned, leading to this retrial where he faced accusations of sexual assault from multiple women, and the outcome reflects the complexities and divisions within the jury regarding the different accusations. </p>

          <p>The State Department is ordering the departure of nonessential staff from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad due to increased security risks in the region. This decision aligns with President Trump's commitment to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East. The embassy already has a limited number of nonessential employees, so the order is not expected to impact many individuals, and the U.S. military is not expected to be involved in transporting personnel out of the country unless the situation on the ground changes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's budget deficit increased to $316 billion in May, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.36 trillion. The annual shortfall is 14% higher than the previous year, driven primarily by surging financing costs, with interest on the national debt exceeding $92 billion. Tax revenue has increased, but rising yields have offset some of the gains.

          <p>Miriam Haley, a victim of Harvey Weinstein, explained her decision to testify again in his retrial, stating it was "for the sake of truth." After a New York court overturned Weinstein's previous conviction, Haley initially hesitated to relive the trauma but was motivated to speak out after seeing a podcast aimed at "exonerating" Weinstein. During the retrial, she recounted the details of the 2006 sexual assault, enduring a challenging cross-examination. The jury found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting Haley, and she expressed hope that the verdict would raise awareness about sexual violence and dispel the myth of the perfect victim.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of Americans' rent payments, totaling $1.4 trillion annually, goes unreported to credit bureaus, hindering their ability to build credit. This lack of reporting leaves over 50 million Americans "credit invisible," limiting their access to loans and other financial opportunities. Companies like Esusu are working to change this by partnering with landlords and providing direct rent reporting services for tenants. By reporting on-time rent payments, individuals can significantly boost their credit scores and improve their financial standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA announced major rollbacks to power plant pollution limits, allowing increased emissions of unhealthy air toxins and planet-heating gases. The plan repeals a climate rule aimed at eliminating greenhouse gases from power plants by the 2030s and weakens regulations on hazardous air pollutants like mercury. Critics warn that these rollbacks will lead to significant pollution increases and harm public health, particularly for vulnerable populations. The administration argues that the changes will save households money and defy what they call the "climate change cult," despite scientific evidence of the dire consequences of climate change and pollution.</p>
