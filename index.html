        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wholesale prices in the U.S. experienced a significant and unexpected increase of 0.9% in July, marking the largest monthly gain since June 2022 and fueling concerns about persistent inflation. The rise was primarily driven by a 1.1% jump in services costs, far exceeding economists' forecasts and suggesting that inflationary pressures remain a threat to the economy. This Producer Price Index (PPI) data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions, as it follows a more moderate consumer inflation report from earlier in the week.

          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly in the final stages of securing a new six-year contract for exclusive UK broadcast rights to the US Open golf championship, successfully fending off a competitive bid from Netflix. This deal would solidify Sky's dominance in UK golf broadcasting, as it already holds rights for all other majors and major tours. The move highlights Netflix's growing ambition in live sports, where it is selectively bidding for major standalone events to attract new subscribers, rather than competing for year-round league content.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's takeover of Kabul, Pakistan is facing a severe deterioration in its internal security as militant groups, particularly the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have been emboldened. These groups have intensified their attacks, turning Pakistan into a new hub of militant activity and straining relations between the two nations. Despite recent diplomatic overtures from Islamabad, including eased trade restrictions, the Taliban's failure to take action against the TTP remains a major obstacle to regional stability.</p>

          <p>A cultural analysis delves into the enduring popularity of the classic children's book character Amelia Bedelia, created by Peggy Parish in 1963. The article examines various interpretations of the character, who is known for her comically literal interpretations of instructions that wreak havoc on her employers' home. These views range from seeing her as a figure with autistic traits to a subversive class warrior, but the core of her appeal may lie in her role as a silly adult who upends authority, which is deeply satisfying to children.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will begin suspending flights ahead of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could start as early as Saturday. The union, CUPE, issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations over wages and other core issues reached an impasse. The airline responded with a lockout notice, warning that the disruption during the peak summer travel season could affect 130,000 customers daily and pose a major risk to the company's operations.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of dissent, hundreds of retired Israeli Air Force pilots, including a former military chief of staff, held a protest in Tel Aviv against the government's ongoing war in Gaza. The group, called "555," argued that the war has run its course, is morally corrosive, and endangers the lives of remaining hostages and soldiers. This protest adds a prominent voice to the growing public calls within Israel for an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict, challenging the government's justification for expanding the military operation.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has issued a legal threat to Hunter Biden, demanding a retraction for his comments in a recent interview that falsely linked her to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a letter, her attorney called the statements defamatory and salacious, stating they have caused significant financial and reputational harm to the former first lady. The letter threatens a lawsuit if Biden does not retract the claim that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a narrative the Trumps have long disputed.</p>

          <p>The Monterey Car Week auctions are underway with tepid sales expectations, reflecting a broader slowdown in the classic car market. Experts attribute the trend to a significant generational shift, as baby boomer collectors are aging out while younger millennial and Gen Z buyers show a preference for newer, more practical supercars from the 1980s, 90s, and 2000s. This has led to falling prices for traditional 1950s and 60s classics, with overall sales projected to be down for the third consecutive year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's cuts to federal research funding, this article proposes that individual states can provide a crucial lifeline to university science programs. The author argues that states with strong technology-based economies should create emergency funds to replace canceled federal grants, thereby preventing a brain drain and the shutdown of critical research. This approach would involve partnerships between state governments, corporations, philanthropists, and the universities themselves to bridge the funding gap until federal support is restored.</p>
