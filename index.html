          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old British citizen, has died following a police chase in north London just three months after receiving a royal pardon in Dubai. Fakana was a passenger in a car that crashed after police attempted to stop the vehicle. He had previously been imprisoned in Dubai for a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old girl but was pardoned in July. His lawyer noted that the experience had renewed his focus on his faith and he was looking forward to a positive future, making his sudden death particularly tragic. The 19-year-old driver of the vehicle was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.</p>

          <p>Iran has executed six prisoners who were accused by the regime of conducting attacks on behalf of Israel in the country's southwest region. The executions are part of a significant increase in state-sanctioned killings, with rights groups like Amnesty International reporting over 1,000 executions in 2025 alone. While Iranian state media claimed the men were responsible for killing security forces, human rights organizations assert they were Arab political prisoners arrested during 2019 protests and forced to confess under torture. A seventh prisoner, a Kurd convicted for a 2009 assassination, was also executed, raising further concerns about the use of torture to extract confessions.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian groups to reconsider planned protests, suggesting they will cause distress and divert police resources following a deadly attack on a Manchester synagogue. He urged demonstrators to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews" during this sensitive time. Police leaders in London and Manchester have expressed concern that the protests will strain resources needed for protecting Jewish community sites. Despite these calls, protest organizers have stated their intention to proceed, arguing that cancelling peaceful demonstrations would be letting terror win and that they must continue to advocate for Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter as an opportune time for a thorough financial review, focusing on tax planning and holiday budgeting. With actual income and spending data available, individuals can make more impactful decisions before the December 31 deadline. This year is particularly crucial due to recent tax law changes, such as a temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap.

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a railway station in Shostka, a city in northern Ukraine, has injured at least 30 people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike on civilian infrastructure as an act of terrorism, stating that Russia could not have been unaware it was targeting civilians. The attack is part of a broader Russian strategy to disrupt Ukraine's essential rail network and energy grid ahead of the winter. In retaliation, Ukraine reportedly struck one of Russia's largest oil refineries, continuing the pattern of reciprocal attacks on critical infrastructure between the two nations.</p>

Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the developments, emphasizing the need for a complete ceasefire, hostage release, and humanitarian aid delivery as priorities for achieving lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that the party will withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if it wins the next election. The decision follows a party-led legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs key policies on migration and the protection of military veterans. This policy shift is seen as a move to counter pressure from the right-wing Reform UK party and will likely be a central issue in their election campaign. The Labour Party criticized the move as a sign of weakness, while legal experts warn of serious political and legal repercussions, including potential breaches of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <p>Students of color and queer students across U.S. college campuses are expressing unease about the valorization of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk after his assassination. Many find the portrayal of Kirk as a national hero unsettling, citing his history of rhetoric they consider hateful toward marginalized communities. In the wake of his death, several historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have faced racist threats, and some students of color have faced disciplinary action for not mourning his death. This has sparked a broader conversation among students about free speech, censorship, and the fear of increased political polarization and scapegoating.</p>

The party aims to challenge Labour from the left but faces historical obstacles, including Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system which disadvantages third parties. Critics argue its focus on a single foreign policy issue and its activist-heavy base may hinder its ability to build a broad coalition and could ultimately split the left-wing vote, benefiting right-wing rivals.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Increased Presence of Pro-Trump Media in White House Press Corps</h2>

          <p>The dynamic of the White House press corps has shifted during Donald Trump's second term, with a notable infiltration of reporters and influencers from pro-Trump media outlets. These individuals often ask laudatory, softball questions, which contrasts with the adversarial role traditionally held by the press. The administration has also altered press protocols, such as selecting the reporter pool for Oval Office Q&As itself rather than allowing the White House Correspondents' Association to do so. Critics argue this strategy emulates authoritarian tactics by surrounding the president with sycophants to avoid accountability and disseminate propaganda, while mainstream reporters continue to face a challenging environment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated $7.6 billion in grants for 223 clean energy projects located exclusively in 16 states that voted for Kamala Harris in the previous presidential election. The Department of Energy stated the projects were not economically viable, but the move is being widely viewed as political retribution amid a government shutdown. White House budget director Russ Vought explicitly stated that money for the "Left's climate agenda is being cancelled." Democratic governors and senators have condemned the decision as a vindictive act that will kill jobs and harm their states' economies and energy independence.</p>

          <p>Michele Mulroney, the newly elected president of the Writers Guild of America West, is taking leadership at a critical time for the industry. She plans to address major challenges including studio consolidation, the shift of production overseas, and the impact of artificial intelligence. A key priority for the upcoming 2026 contract negotiations will be securing increased studio contributions to the writers' health plan, which has been strained by a recent industry contraction. Mulroney emphasized the guild's readiness to fight for a fair contract, building on recent victories like the reinstatement of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after writer protests.</p>

          <p>An opinion column argues that criticism of Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny being chosen for the Super Bowl halftime show is nonsensical and rooted in nativism. The author points out that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and that the NFL has a long history of featuring non-American acts like The Rolling Stones and U2. The piece refutes claims by conservative commentators that the Spanish-language singer "hates America," framing the choice as a logical business decision by the NFL to appeal to a global audience. The columnist suggests that instead of fearing a non-English performance, critics should see it as an opportunity for cultural growth.</p>

Three of the alleged attackers, aged 16 and 17, face special allegations of a hate crime.

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer for homeowners unable to get coverage elsewhere, is requesting an average rate hike of 35.8% after incurring an estimated $4 billion in losses from January's wildfires. The insurance pool, which has seen its policyholder numbers swell as private insurers retreat from high-risk areas, says the increase is necessary to cover anticipated claims and expenses. The proposed hike must be approved by the state's insurance commissioner and is facing opposition from consumer advocates. They argue that no increase should be granted until disputes over the plan's handling of smoke damage claims are resolved. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial appearances of a weak negotiating position, the Democratic party's strategy during the ongoing government shutdown might be succeeding. Early polling indicates that the public is placing more blame on President Trump and congressional Republicans for the shutdown than on Democrats. The Trump administration's overt and punitive actions, such as the Office of Management and Budget director publicly cancelling projects in blue states, may be backfiring. Instead of pressuring Democratic leaders, these moves could be perceived by voters as petty and harmful, potentially damaging Republican standing with the electorate, including in key swing districts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) is now at a standstill after another commissioner's resignation left the agency with only two of its six seats filled. The FEC requires a quorum of at least four members to vote on any substantive matters, including opening investigations, issuing penalties, or creating new rules. This lack of a quorum, a recurring issue in recent years, effectively halts the enforcement of campaign finance laws.
