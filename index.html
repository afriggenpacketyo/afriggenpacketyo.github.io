          <p>In a formal court filing, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests. This declaration contradicts previous public statements from White House advisor Stephen Miller, who had mentioned a goal of achieving a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day. The filing is part of an ongoing lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups in California that accuse the administration of conducting unconstitutional immigration sweeps. The administration's lawyers stated that while the figure may have been discussed as a goal, no such policy or directive has been issued to ICE.</p>

          <p>Legendary quarterback Tom Brady, who turned 48, has humorously hinted at the possibility of playing football into his 50s. The seven-time Super Bowl champion shared an NFL post detailing his impressive career statistics by decade, adding the caption "50’s coming soon?" with emojis. While likely not a serious consideration of unretiring for a second time, the post sparked conversation among fans. Brady recently became a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and is also set to begin his role as an NFL broadcaster for Fox.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area. The event caused brief shaking and confusion among residents but resulted in no reported injuries or significant structural damage. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause damage. This tremor comes after a more significant, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled the same region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity can occur on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 unionized workers at Boeing's St. Louis defense facilities are set to strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers stated that the proposal was insufficient and did not reflect the skill and dedication of its members. The strike will impact the assembly of Boeing's fighter jets and the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone. This marks the first strike at the St. Louis defense hub since 1996, affecting a key part of the U.S. military's supply chain.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven largely by economic factors and streamlined state regulations. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the surge, finding solar to be cheaper than natural gas, even without subsidies. This growth has occurred despite the state government removing climate change from its official policy language. However, the industry faces future challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop solar installations.</p>

          <p>After securing victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix, McLaren driver Lando Norris acknowledged that he is "not making life very easy" for himself in the tight Formula 1 championship battle with his teammate, Oscar Piastri. The win, his third in the last four races, closed the points gap between the two drivers to just nine. Norris admitted he needs to improve and be more consistent in the second half of the season to give himself the best opportunity for the title.</p>

          <p>An incredible fourth day of cricket has left the final Test between England and India balanced on a knife-edge. Chasing a record 374, England reached 339-6 before bad weather stopped play, needing just 35 more runs to win the series 3-1. However, with four wickets remaining, India needs to dismiss them to level the series 2-2. The day featured sublime centuries from England's Joe Root and Harry Brook before a late fightback from India's bowlers set up a thrilling conclusion.</p>

          <p>Following a week of poor economic data, Trump administration officials defended the president's policies and his controversial firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett pointed to data revisions as a cause for concern. However, critics, including a former Trump-appointed BLS head and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, condemned the firing as a politically motivated act that undermines the credibility of vital government data.

Responding to plans outlined by CMS Administrator Dr. Oz, she argued the changes create excessive paperwork for providers and patients. Grisham also contended that the associated $50 billion fund for rural hospitals is vastly insufficient to prevent the widespread closure of facilities in her state and across the country, calling the overall $900 billion cut to Medicaid "catastrophic."</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, after being struck by a boat. The collision was forceful enough to nearly capsize the vessel and throw a passenger overboard, though the person was reportedly unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it came to rest on a shallow sandbar. A necropsy is planned to determine the exact cause of death, and boaters are being advised to use caution in the area.</p>

          <p>An informal summer deadline for a new U.S.-Canada trade deal has passed without an agreement, prolonging a six-month tariff war between the two neighbors. While the U.S. has imposed a 35% tariff rate on some goods, the existing Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA/USMCA) provides a crucial buffer, allowing nearly 90% of Canadian exports to cross the border duty-free. This has given Canadian negotiators some breathing room and reduced the immediate economic pressure to accept a deal quickly.</p>
