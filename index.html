          <p>More than 17,000 people in Manitoba, Canada are being evacuated due to raging wildfires, prompting a province-wide state of emergency. Premier Wab Kinew has requested military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney to aid in both evacuation and firefighting efforts. The evacuations include the town of Flin Flon, and residents of remote towns and Indigenous communities are being transported to Winnipeg. This is the largest evacuation in Manitoba's recent history, with 134 wildfires currently burning across Canada. The worst wildfire season in Canadian history occurred in 2023, with only recorded deaths being firefighters.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move has sparked anxiety across US university campuses and could lead to retaliation from China, the origin country for the second-largest group of international students in the US. American universities have long benefited from talented students from China, and many rely on international students' tuition for revenue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked steep reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Trump on scores of countries in April.

The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports.

Trump also commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Gangster Disciples, and pardoned former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland.</p>

          <p>The British government is considering sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The decision follows rising pressure over the suffering of civilians and condemnation of Israel‚Äôs expansion of military operations. While the proposal, first floated by David Cameron, has gained momentum, the recent attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington has caused some officials to pause. Britain is likely to wait to see if Israel allows more aid into Gaza before making a final decision.</p>
