        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in August, falling just 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from the 2.6% drop in July. This resilience was largely driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp increase in exports to Western Europe, which helped offset a steep 13.8% decline in exports to the United States. Despite the softer contraction, this marks the fourth consecutive month of negative growth for the world's fourth-largest economy. The data provides a mixed economic picture as the nation also navigates political uncertainty with the impending resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Hong Kong presents a unique and strategic option for hosting China's proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging Shanghai's front-runner status. While Shanghai offers robust AI infrastructure and strong government backing, Hong Kong's distinct "one country, two systems" framework and independent judiciary could help reassure international partners and mitigate Western skepticism. The article suggests that choosing Hong Kong would be a nuanced move by Beijing to navigate US-China tech tensions. This would position the city at the center of China's AI diplomacy and influence on global standards.</p>

Dan Cooper was motivated to re-report the 2004 assault to police after his experience serving on a jury in 2018 made him realize he needed to pursue justice for himself. The article details the attack, his subsequent diagnosis with complex PTSD, and the long journey to see his assailant, Shaun Gilder, convicted.

          <p>House GOP leadership has introduced a short-term continuing resolution to fund the government until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown ahead of the September 30 deadline. The bill includes current funding levels and an additional $30 million for lawmaker security following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a vote this week, but the measure faces opposition from Democrats, who are demanding an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. With a slim majority, Republicans require near-unanimous support to pass the bill in the House before it faces a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Multiple individuals, including a political analyst, a sports reporter, and a university employee, have been fired or disciplined by their employers for public comments made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for speech that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies, as First Amendment protections are limited in the private sector.

According to her prepared testimony, she believes she was fired for refusing to pre-approve recommendations from a new vaccine advisory panel and for not dismissing career scientists as directed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Monarez will warn that proceeding with the panel's upcoming meeting poses a "real risk" to the availability of children's vaccines.

          <p>The European Chamber of Commerce in China reports that Beijing is maintaining tight control over rare earth mineral exports, causing significant financial losses for foreign companies. At least one member company has reportedly lost millions of euros due to difficulties in obtaining the necessary export licenses, which have become more restrictive despite a brief period of increased approvals earlier in the year. This situation adds to declining foreign business confidence in China, which is already suffering from a sluggish domestic economy. These minerals are critical for manufacturing a wide range of products, from electric vehicles to semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some landlords in the United Kingdom are selling their rental properties in anticipation of the new Renters' Rights Bill, which introduces significant protections for tenants. The legislation will ban Section 21 "no-fault" evictions, give tenants greater power to challenge rent increases, and make it illegal to discriminate against those on benefits. While tenant advocacy groups have welcomed the changes as a means to provide greater security, some landlords express concern that the new rules will make it harder to manage their properties. This has led to fears that a reduction in available rental housing could inadvertently drive up rents.</p>

San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrived shortly after and arrested 29-year-old Rashawn Lee at the shopping center.

          <p>Observers have noted the conspicuous absence of high-ranking generals leading troop formations at China's recent Victory Day parade, a departure from previous major military displays in 2015 and 2019. In past parades, dozens of generals marched alongside their soldiers, a move officially described as setting an example and offering a rare glimpse into the People's Liberation Army's leadership. The lack of visible senior commanders this year has led to speculation, as these events are typically a key opportunity to identify rising stars and understand personnel changes within the historically opaque Chinese military command structure.</p>

          <p>Authorities report that a 71-year-old man, George Zinn, was arrested for obstruction of justice after allegedly making a false confession at the scene of Charlie Kirk's assassination. According to the Utah County Sheriff, Zinn admitted he shouted that he was the shooter to create a diversion and allow the actual gunman to escape. The primary suspect, Tyler Robinson, reportedly referenced Zinn's initial arrest in a text message, noting police had "grabbed some crazy old dude." Zinn is not believed to have colluded with the gunman but now faces separate charges for possession of child sexual abuse material.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has posited that JPMorgan Chase could be the next non-technology company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, a milestone currently dominated by tech giants. Cramer cited the bank's excellence in lending, capital markets, and global reach, along with strong leadership from CEO Jamie Dimon, as key drivers for its potential growth. He also noted that the entire banking sector is experiencing an expansion of price-to-earnings multiples, suggesting Wall Street is increasingly willing to invest in financial institutions.

          <p>New data reveals a significant shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. According to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, this represents a dramatic increase from just over 6% a decade ago. The trend is largely attributed to the growing popularity of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that automatics are often easier for learners, allowing them to focus more on road safety.</p>

          <p>This article provides context on President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which he alleges published false and malicious articles to undermine his 2024 campaign. The lawsuit is viewed as part of a broader strategy to intimidate media outlets and suppress critical reporting. However, the legal bar for a public figure to win a defamation case is extremely high, requiring proof of "actual malice," meaning the outlet knew the information was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. Given that truth is an absolute defense, the lawsuit is considered highly unlikely to succeed on its legal merits.</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported near Mount St. Helens in Washington state after strong winds kicked up volcanic ash from the mountain's 1980 eruption. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry, loose ash is lifted into the air during gusty and arid conditions, which are currently prevalent in the drought-stricken area. The U.S. Geological Survey and National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not due to new volcanic activity. However, they warn that the resuspended ash can be hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Under manager Thomas Frank, Tottenham Hotspur has shifted to a more pragmatic and defensive style, a stark contrast to the attack-focused approach of the previous season. This change was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games. Players and analysts note the team's new emphasis on a "clean sheet mentality" and strong defensive structure. While effective in securing results, this cautious strategy has resulted in fewer shots on target and less of the free-flowing offensive football that fans were previously accustomed to seeing.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the irony of how the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk is being used by some of his political allies to call for crackdowns on dissent and "hate speech." The author argues that Kirk built his career on championing free speech as a tool to spread his controversial ideas, particularly in environments hostile to them. Now that his allies are in power, they appear eager to suppress opposing views, a move that contradicts the very principles Kirk advocated for. The piece warns that this shift represents a dangerous embrace of censorship over open debate.</p>
