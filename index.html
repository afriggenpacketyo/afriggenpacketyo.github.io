          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans might have to "do with less" as a result of the ongoing trade war with China. The article notes that Trump insisted the trade war would be worse for China, which relies on the U.S. as a market to sell its goods. Trump also asserted that Americans don't need many of the goods imported from China, suggesting they could manage with fewer items, even if those items cost slightly more. The president stated that China is the leading candidate for the "chief-ripper-offer," implying they have taken advantage of the U.S. in trade relations.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article details how the Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to expedite immigrant deportations, focusing on the deportation of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The article reveals that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, sought assurances that the deportees had gang ties and requested a list of Salvadoran MS-13 leaders in U.S. custody. Lawyers argue that the deportation operation circumvented due process and swept up individuals who were not gang members. The article also mentions that the U.S. has paid El Salvador millions to imprison the deportees, sparking scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears open to allowing Oklahoma to use government money to run the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The New York Times article examines the legal arguments surrounding the case, focusing on whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor religious charter schools. Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested excluding the school would be discrimination against religion, while Justice Elena Kagan argued the school has many hallmarks of regular public schools. The outcome of the case could affect laws in 46 other states and further blur the line between government funding of private and religious schools.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's promises to cut spending, the federal government has spent over $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same period last year. The article highlights that the government is spending more day-to-day than in nine of the last ten years, excluding 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of Treasury Department reports reveals that rising costs are primarily driven by direct payments to the military, seniors, and increasing interest on the national debt. The administration's cost-cutting efforts, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have focused on smaller targets, with limited impact on the overall budget.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Stars FC have fired their head coach, Lorne Donaldson, after a poor start to the season, with a record of 1-5-0. The article mentions that Masaki Hemmi has been named interim head coach. Donaldson was hired in December 2023 with the hope that he could turn around a franchise that has not won a playoff game since 2021.
