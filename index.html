          <p>An explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in at least one fatality and several injuries, prompting investigations by the FBI and ATF. The incident occurred on North Indian Canyon Drive, affecting nearby health care facilities, including American Reproductive Centers. The American Reproductive Centers confirmed that a vehicle exploded in the parking lot, but assured that their staff, eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials remained secure and undamaged. The U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California indicated the possibility of an intentional act and residents have been asked to avoid the area while authorities continue their investigation. </p>

          <p>The audio recording of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur reveals the former president struggling to recall dates and details, raising questions about his cognitive fitness. The five-hour interview, conducted as part of the investigation into his handling of classified documents, shows Biden's thoughts appearing jumbled and his memory failing him. Hur's report concluded that Biden would be seen by a jury as a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," a conclusion supported by the audio's release. The audio recording puts Democrats in an uncomfortable position as they reconcile the man heard in the interview with the forceful president they previously described.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to speak with Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, describing it as a “bloodbath.” The call will also address trade issues. Following the call with Putin, Trump will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders of some NATO countries. The move comes after fruitless talks in Istanbul between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, though a prisoner swap was agreed upon. Trump previously offered to attend the talks if Putin would also be there.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a high-stakes presidential election between hard-right "sovereignist" George Simion and pro-EU liberal Nicusor Dan, with the EU closely monitoring the outcome. Simion, a fan of Trump and Orbán, won the first round, while Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, is pro-European. The election is seen as crucial for Romania's relationship with the EU and NATO, as Simion's victory could potentially lead to instability and a shift away from established alliances.</p>

          <p>Fernando Alonso qualified fifth for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, marking Aston Martin's best showing this season, following a major car upgrade influenced by new managing technical partner Adrian Newey. Alonso acknowledged that while he was happy with the result, it wasn't close to his or the team's ambitions, which are to win races. He anticipates a tactical race in Imola, emphasizing the difficulty of overtaking and the need for a good start and strategy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the secret to happiness may depend upon individual differences rather than broad, population-level factors. Researchers found that socioeconomic factors, such as health, wealth, and social connections, significantly influence happiness, but individual perspectives also play a crucial role. The study measured associations between life and domain satisfaction at the population and individual level, using data from over 40,000 subjects. The findings highlight possible limitations of population-level happiness research and suggest that a more personalized approach may be more effective in promoting happiness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took U.S. sanctions officials by surprise, lacking specifics on which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. The decision came after months of lobbying from Syria's transitional government, which blames sanctions for its economic struggles. While some work was underway at Treasury for an incremental lifting of sanctions, the broad announcement caught many officials off guard. Relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced that new ceasefire talks have begun in Doha, mediated by Qatari and US officials, hours after Israel launched a major new offensive in Gaza. The offensive, called "Operation Gideon's Chariots," has resulted in significant casualties and prompted condemnation from the UN and some European leaders. The talks are focused on releasing remaining hostages in exchange for a period of calm, but obstacles remain. The intensified military action comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens, with warnings of famine.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is expanding its influence through significant economic and strategic investments. UAE corporations are investing heavily in ports, critical minerals, renewable energy projects, and infrastructure across the continent. With investments totaling $110 billion since 2019, the UAE aims to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and establish itself as a key player in global supply chains. This shift contrasts with the Trump administration's efforts to reduce America’s involvement in Africa.</p>

          <p>Combat sport clubs have been identified as recruitment tools for the white nationalist hate group Patriot Front, according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. These "Active Clubs" serve as smaller networks where members train in mixed martial arts and bond over white supremacist ideologies. Patriot Front uses these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, evading law enforcement and researchers. The report highlights a 14% increase in hate groups since 2023, with Active Clubs present in at least 34 states.</p>
