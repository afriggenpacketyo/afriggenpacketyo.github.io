          <p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) conducted an attack on Iran's Isfahan nuclear site, targeting facilities involved in uranium conversion and enrichment.  The IDF stated the strike dismantled key infrastructure, while Iranian media showed air defenses responding. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed deep concern over the attack, emphasizing that nuclear facilities should never be targeted due to the potential harm to people and the environment. This action adds to a series of Israeli strikes against Iranian nuclear capabilities, escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Wave refraction, the bending of waves as they pass over changing depths, significantly impacts how waves break.  Concave refraction, focusing energy towards the middle of the wave, creates powerful waves like those at Pipeline.  Convex refraction, defocusing energy, is common at point breaks like J-Bay.  Beach breaks are influenced by a combination of factors, including swell period and sandbar interaction, which can result in hollow waves or closeouts.</p>
