        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts will miss games against the New York Yankees due to a fractured toe sustained while walking to the bathroom in the dark, according to reports. X-rays confirmed the fracture, and manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to be day-to-day, though putting on a shoe proved difficult. This injury follows a similar incident involving teammate Freddie Freeman, who missed games after slipping in the shower, as Freeman aggravated a surgically repaired ankle. Betts, the 2018 AL MVP, is having a relatively down year, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs, while the Dodgers beat the Yankees in a World Series rematch powered by Shohei Ohtani's two homers. The team hopes to manage this setback and continue their season successfully. Optimism is cautiously high, as the injury is not expected to be long-term.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated British rival Jacob Fearnley in a French Open third-round match, but the match was disrupted by loud fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium, causing distractions for both players. Norrie secured a 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 victory over Fearnley, who appeared to sustain an injury in the second set, reaching the last 16 of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time. The match was played amidst bizarre circumstances, with almost 50,000 supporters arriving at the Parc des Princes to watch PSG's Champions League final on big screens, resulting in car horns and police sirens. Despite the distractions, Norrie managed to maintain focus, while Fearnley produced a double fault on match point, as Norrie expressed his joy and acknowledged the toughness of the match against Fearnley. The environment was tense, but Norrie's victory brings a sense of accomplishment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses questions about delaying Medicare enrollment, explaining that delaying can result in penalties that increase premiums for life. However, if an individual or their spouse is still working for an employer with 20 or more employees, they can generally opt to keep the employer-provided health insurance and delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying Medicare enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account (HSA), which are no longer allowed once enrolled in Medicare. The article also clarifies the tax laws related to capital gains and home sales, distinguishing between the home sale exemption for primary residences and 1031 exchanges for investment properties.

          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest ceasefire proposal by U.S. Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff, reiterating its key demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and continuous flow of humanitarian aid.

Meanwhile, Israeli forces have reportedly killed at least 60 Palestinians and injured 284 across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The White House confirmed that an Israeli-approved ceasefire proposal was submitted to Hamas, as Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to warn the public to avoid the area. The incident occurred on Weidkamp Road, which was closed to allow beekeepers to assist in re-hiving the bees. Authorities initially reported that 250 million bees had escaped, but later corrected the number with the help of a beekeeper on the scene, and the public was advised to stay at least 600 feet away from the area. More than two dozen beekeepers assisted with the rescue, aiming to save as many bees as possible, as hive boxes were recovered and restored, with the expectation that most bees would return to their hives by morning.</p>

China has responded by accusing the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, while Hegseth emphasized that the U.S. does not seek conflict with China but will ensure its allies are not intimidated. The U.S. aims to forge a strong shield of deterrence with allies, urging Asian countries to upgrade their defenses and partner with the U.S., not depend on it.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. cease-fire proposal for Gaza, with officials stating that Hamas is demanding changes, including guarantees to end the war, which has been a major point of contention with Israel. The militant group says it will release 10 living and 18 deceased hostages still held in Gaza, but there appear to be other details that need to be worked out before a cease-fire is declared. Hamas is seeking a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war, while the U.S. has proposed a deal that includes a 60-day cease-fire. More than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the war began nearly 20 months ago when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing about 1,200.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism is being challenged by scientists who argue that genetics play a more significant role. Kennedy, now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find environmental culprits, despite evidence suggesting that increased autism rates are mainly due to expanding diagnostic criteria and better screening. Experts have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, building a case that genetics are the most important driver, rather than a single environmental toxin. Researchers fear that Kennedy's fixation on external toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies for those with profound autism.</p>

The city's request for federal support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was denied due to restructuring within the Health and Human Services department. The CDC's lead exposure team was laid off, leaving Milwaukee to navigate the crisis independently, despite past reliance on federal expertise for epidemiological investigations. The city has replaced 10,000 lead water service lines but needs additional funding to replace the remaining 55,000, highlighting the challenges of addressing public health emergencies without federal assistance.</p>

The suspension follows the U.S. State Department's revoking visas of several Mexican musicians for playing music that glorifies cartel violence. Grupo Firme stated that the visas of the band and their team are under "administrative review by the U.S. Embassy," making it impossible to perform at the La Onda Fest, and this announcement came shortly after the bodies of five Mexican musicians were found in Reynosa. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico cited visa cases as confidential and could not provide more information, and Grupo Firme has recently taken steps to distance itself from music glorifying criminal groups.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until she undergoes newly mandated genetic sex testing, and the organization announced it will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers. World Boxing cited concerns arising from Khelif's potential participation in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup as the reason for the decision. The testing mandate follows controversy surrounding Khelif after she won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, fueled by claims from the International Boxing Association that she failed eligibility tests, and athletes will now need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and eligibility to compete, starting July 1, 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the pervasive use of corporate buzzwords and their negative impact on workplace communication, as buzzwords are intended to convey pithy meaning but often impede trust and create confusion. Gen Z employees may be particularly vulnerable, clinging to jargon as corporate life rafts, and employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon. The author suggests that buzzwords are used to distract from the primary goal of making money and recommends using real-human-people words instead. The piece concludes with a call to action to avoid jargon and embrace clear, authentic communication in the workplace.</p>

Photos from the Shoah Memorial show paint coating a wall engraved with the names of 76,000 Jewish deportees, and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau expressed his "immense disgust" regarding the acts. The acts come ahead of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, and France's interior ministry had already called for heightened security around Jewish sites due to heightened global tensions, as no suspects have been arrested and no group has claimed responsibility.</p>

Earlier this week, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff proposed the deal, which includes a 60-day ceasefire, and Israel had accepted Witkoff's proposal. Hamas is still seeking other demands, including a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war, and more than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the war began nearly 20 months ago.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing to unveil a major review of the military, the strategic defence review, amidst concerns about a "new, dangerous era" with a malevolent Russia and uncertainty about U.S. commitment to European defense. The review is expected to underline the importance of nuclear weapons and the UK's commitment to NATO, with an emphasis on modernizing forces and adapting to the evolving nature of conflict. The review will stress a greater need for public participation in protecting the country, and it is expected to include announcements about British industry creating more defense kit, expanding the cadet forces, and bolstering the number of men and women in the military reserves. However, critics question whether the review's promises match the increasingly urgent rhetoric about the dangers faced.</p>

The impending solar storm is predicted to be a level 4 out of 5, and the aurora happens when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's magnetic field, creating green, red, pink, purple, and blue colors.
