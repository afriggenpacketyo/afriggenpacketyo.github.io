          <p>The Justice Department has placed a government attorney on indefinite paid leave following a hearing in a lawsuit concerning a man deported to El Salvador in error. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, was reportedly reprimanded for a "failure to zealously advocate" for the government's interests. During the hearing, Reuveni struggled to provide Judge Paula Xinis with details regarding the deportation and the administration's inability to facilitate the man's return to the United States.

          <p>Consumers are stocking up on goods ahead of President Trump's tariffs, which economists expect will increase prices for everyday items. Auto sales surged in March as buyers rushed to beat tariffs on imported cars, and some consumers are purchasing electronics and other goods in anticipation of price increases. Experts caution consumers to avoid going into debt to beat the "tariff effect," advising them to consider their long-term financial situation. While some worry about potential shortages, analysts anticipate the supply chain is in much better shape than during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, in its deportation campaign against Venezuelan immigrants, has relied on tattoos to identify alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang. However, tattoo artists claim that some tattoos used as examples by the DHS have innocent meanings, such as commemorating the birth of a child or referencing the band AC/DC. Experts say that TDA doesn't typically use tattoos for membership, and the ACLU has accused DHS of wrongly deporting people with no opportunity to challenge the claims against them.</p>

          <p>A district court judge awarded over $6 million to four whistleblowers who were fired after reporting Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to the FBI. The judge found that the whistleblowers were fired in retaliation for reporting allegations that Paxton was using his office to accept bribes. Paxton's office intends to appeal the ruling, calling it "ridiculous" and "not based on the facts or the law." Paxton was previously at the center of a federal investigation for bribery allegations.</p>

The administration's demand threatens Title I funding, which supports low-income areas, but state officials maintain their commitment to complying with federal civil rights laws.</p>

          <p>An animal rights group criticized ITV's coverage of the Grand National after Broadway Boy's heavy fall, accusing the broadcaster of a "cowardly refusal" to replay the incident. Initial fears for Broadway Boy's life eased as he got to his feet and was returned to the stables, though jockey Tom Bellamy was taken to the hospital for assessment. The incident sparked debate about animal welfare and the safety of horses in steeplechase racing. The race was eventually won by Nick Rockett.</p>
