          <h2>Singapore-Based Scientist Warns of Potential Hack of China's Quantum Satellite</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientist based in Singapore has raised concerns about the security of China's quantum satellite, Micius, stating that it could be vulnerable to hacking. The vulnerability stems from slight time delays between the satellite's onboard lasers, which could be exploited by eavesdroppers. The scientist, Alexander Miller, analyzed communication data between a ground station and Micius, finding that the distribution of quantum keys was insecure due to these time delays. Quantum communication, which relies on quantum physics-based cryptography, is theoretically unhackable, but realistic devices are susceptible to side-channel attacks that exploit flaws in implementation, according to Miller. The finding raises questions about the security of China's expanding quantum communication network. </p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, indicating a willingness to release hostages but requesting amendments to the plan. The group insists on a permanent truce, a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guarantees for continuous humanitarian aid, none of which are currently part of the proposed deal. Hamas has stated it is prepared to release 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 dead hostages in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. The U.S. envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, has deemed Hamas' response "totally unacceptable," while Israeli officials maintain that Hamas continues to refuse the updated framework for hostage release. The group is facing immense pressure from both the international community and the dire conditions in Gaza. </p>

          <p>An investigation raises concerns about the Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), one of the world's largest reforestation efforts, questioning whether it is truly restoring forests. Satellite data and field reports suggest that the program struggles with natural resource plundering and the replacement of native forests with plantations of invasive species. Analysis of satellite images indicates that deforestation occurs on NGP land, with native trees cleared to grow cash crops. The investigation reveals a pattern of "greenwashing," where commodities grown on these sites are falsely marketed as sustainable. </p>
