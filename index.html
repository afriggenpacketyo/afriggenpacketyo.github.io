          <p>Nvidia has confirmed it is evaluating new products for the Chinese market, following reports of a powerful new AI chip called the B30A. This development comes as the company navigates U.S. export controls designed to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. The U.S. government recently allowed Nvidia and AMD to resume sales in China in exchange for a 15% share of their revenue from the region. The company stated any new offerings would be fully compliant with government approvals and designed for commercial use.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act.

The move is part of a broader push to reshore U.S. manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign chipmakers.

          <p>Stocks tied to the cryptocurrency market, including exchanges like Coinbase and crypto-holding firms, saw significant drops on Tuesday as investors moved away from technology and other high-risk assets. The sell-off coincided with a nearly 3% pullback in Bitcoin's price from its recent all-time high. This downturn reflects the crypto market's sensitivity to broader tech sector trends and investor uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming economic symposium.

          <p>Walmart is recalling specific lots of its Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp following a Food and Drug Administration warning about potential radioactive contamination. The FDA detected the isotope Cesium-137 in a shipment from the same Indonesian supplier, though that specific shipment did not enter U.S. commerce. While the detected levels were below the FDA's threshold for acute health hazards, the agency noted that long-term exposure could elevate cancer risks.

          <p>Recent research from the USC Schaeffer Center challenges the rationale provided by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for restructuring a key federal vaccine advisory committee. Kennedy had cited "persistent conflicts of interest" as the reason for the changes, but the new study published in JAMA found that conflicts on the panel have been at historic lows for years. The research indicated that the most concerning type of conflict—personal income from vaccine makers—had been virtually eliminated from the committee. This comes as Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, continues to overhaul federal health agencies.</p>

          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence software company Palantir fell over 9% on Tuesday, extending a five-day losing streak that has seen the stock pull back more than 15% from its recent all-time high.

Palantir has been a top performer in the S&P 500 this year, benefiting from AI enthusiasm and government contracts. However, its rapid ascent has led to a very high valuation compared to other major tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer has publicly criticized the NCAA's penalties against the University of Michigan for its sign-stealing scandal. Meyer contrasted Michigan's punishment, which includes a fine and a suspension for the head coach, with the harsher sanctions Ohio State received in 2011, which included a bowl ban that affected uninvolved players. While agreeing that current Michigan players should not be punished, he argued the ruling demonstrates that the NCAA no longer functions as a credible enforcement body. The penalties for Michigan also include show-cause orders for former coach Jim Harbaugh and other staff members.</p>

This valuation places Databricks among a small group of private tech companies, including SpaceX and OpenAI, to reach this milestone. The company, which was last valued at $62 billion, has seen strong revenue growth, forecasting $3.7 billion in annualized revenue. CEO Ali Ghodsi noted that investor interest surged following the successful IPO of design software firm Figma, signaling a potentially reopening market for tech offerings.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has released updated immunization guidelines that diverge from the current federal recommendations, urging that children as young as six months receive the Covid-19 vaccine. This contrasts with the CDC's current stance, which advises that vaccination for most children be a matter of "shared clinical decision-making." The AAP's move comes after the Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., halted broad recommendations for healthy children to get the vaccine. The AAP stated it was providing clear guidance in an environment of misinformation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has expanded its use of "safe third country" agreements, striking deals with Honduras and Uganda to accept the deportation of migrants who are not their own citizens. Internal documents reveal Uganda has agreed to take in deportees from other African nations, while Honduras will receive several hundred deportees from other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. These agreements are part of a broader diplomatic effort to facilitate the administration's mass deportation campaign. Human rights advocates have condemned the practice, raising concerns that migrants could be sent to unsafe locations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit filed by civil rights attorneys concerning the "Alligator Alcatraz" temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades. The dismissed claim alleged a Fifth Amendment violation because the government had not clarified which immigration court had jurisdiction, preventing detainees from filing petitions. The judge ruled this point moot after the government designated a court in South Florida to hear the cases. However, claims regarding violations of detainees' First Amendment rights to confidential access to lawyers remain active, and the case was transferred to a different federal district.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of "betraying Israel" and abandoning Australia's Jewish community. The sharp criticism follows Australia's decision to deny a visa to a far-right member of Netanyahu's coalition and its announcement that it will recognize a Palestinian state. In response, Israel revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority. The diplomatic relationship has become increasingly strained, with Netanyahu calling Albanese a "weak politician" amid rising tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>A UK council has successfully won a temporary High Court injunction to prevent The Bell Hotel in Epping from being used to house asylum seekers. Epping Forest District Council argued that the hotel's use constituted a breach of planning law and had become a public safety risk, citing recent protests and escalating community tensions. The ruling requires asylum seekers to be moved from the property by September 12. The decision came after a resident of the hotel was charged with the sexual assault of a teenager, which sparked a series of demonstrations in the town.</p>

          <p>A Sheraton hotel in Louisiana, part of the Marriott chain, has reportedly been used by U.S. immigration officials to detain immigrants, including families, ahead of deportation. This appears to contradict a 2019 pledge from Marriott that its properties would not be used as detention facilities in cooperation with ICE. Evidence suggests the hotel, located near a major deportation hub, has been used for this purpose since late 2023. The situation raises questions about whether Marriott has a formal contract with ICE or is aware of the use of its franchised properties for detentions.</p>

Despite the company's historical, albeit informal, connection to this labor pool, it has not taken a public stance, stating that it is not involved in or notified about enforcement actions. Advocacy groups are frustrated by the company's neutrality, arguing it has a moral obligation to defend the laborers, who are also its customers. The raids have created an atmosphere of fear, impacting both the laborers and other customers.</p>

The court affirmed that live theatrical performances, including drag, are a form of expression protected by the Constitution. However, the article criticizes the judicial process, noting it took over two years for the courts to reach this conclusion, effectively denying the student organizers their free speech rights.</p>
