          <p>President Trump has announced plans to send the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, to combat crime, stating that the state's governor and the city's mayor support the decision. The move follows a similar deployment in Washington, D.C., and is part of a White House strategy to use federal resources in cities it describes as having failed Democratic governance. This decision comes despite the Memphis Police Department reporting that overall crime is at a 25-year low, raising questions about the legal justification for such a deployment.</p>

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, the jailed mayor of Istanbul and a prominent rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is on trial for allegedly falsifying his university degree. Prosecutors are seeking a lengthy prison sentence and a ban from political activity, which would prevent him from running in the 2028 presidential election. Imamoglu maintains his innocence, stating his degree transfer from a university in Northern Cyprus to Istanbul University was legitimate and calling the charges politically motivated and absurd.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is approaching a potential shutdown as the September 30 funding deadline nears, with Democrats and Republicans at an impasse over healthcare provisions. Democratic leaders have stated they will not support any spending bills that do not address their priorities, including reversing recent changes to Medicaid and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. President Trump has encouraged Republicans not to negotiate, increasing the likelihood that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to avoid a lapse in government operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for one year. The decision lifts a lower court's injunction and could force up to 200 clinics, many in rural or underserved areas, to close. Planned Parenthood advocates argue the move is a backdoor abortion ban that will severely limit access to essential health services like cancer screenings and contraception for millions of low-income patients.</p>

          <p>Following violent protests that led to the prime minister's resignation, Nepal's president has appointed former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as the nation's interim leader. Karki, 73, is the first woman to hold the position and is known for her strong anti-corruption stance during her time on the Supreme Court. Her appointment comes after days of deadly unrest, originally sparked by a social media ban, which escalated to reflect broader public discontent and left over 50 people dead.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years in prison after being convicted of leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 election results. The supreme court found him guilty of plotting a coup that included online disinformation campaigns and culminated in the January 2023 riots in Brasília. The verdict is being hailed as a landmark moment for Brazilian democracy and a significant challenge to the country's historical norms of impunity for political leaders.</p>

          <p>This review of the latest "Downton Abbey" film praises it as a satisfying conclusion that stays true to the series' strengths, focusing on small-scale social and family dramas set in 1930.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review describes the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel "The Long Walk" as a dark and grim depiction of a dystopian contest where 100 teenage boys must walk until only one survivor remains. While praising the strong performances of the young ensemble cast, the review notes that the film's critique of capitalism and voyeurism is somewhat muddled. It highlights the movie's unflinching graphic content but questions whether it effectively implicates the audience in the on-screen brutality.</p>

          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds, investors are watching to see if anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts will push this "wall of cash" into riskier assets like stocks. While some analysts believe lower yields on cash will fuel a market rally, others argue that the majority of these funds, especially institutional cash, will remain put unless rates fall to near zero. The debate highlights uncertainty about investor behavior in a shifting monetary policy environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Shapiro called for leaders to use words of healing rather than vengeance and praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox for his unifying response to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A new inquest has opened into the death of Steve Biko, a prominent anti-apartheid activist who died in police custody 48 years ago from a severe brain injury. His family expressed confidence that the process will finally lead to the prosecution of those responsible, a crucial step toward accountability for apartheid-era crimes. Despite previous admissions of assault by former officers during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, no one has ever been prosecuted for Biko's death.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1985 Senate hearing where musicians like Dee Snider and Frank Zappa testified against the Parents Music Resource Center's (PMRC) push for warning labels on albums with explicit content. Co-founded by Tipper Gore, the PMRC argued for "truth in packaging" to help parents, ultimately leading to the industry's voluntary adoption of the "Parental Advisory" sticker. The labels became a cultural fixture, with some artists claiming the warnings actually boosted their sales.</p>

Routh, who is representing himself despite having no legal training, had his opening statement cut short by the judge for being irrelevant and making a "mockery of the court." Prosecutors laid out their case, alleging a carefully planned attack and presenting testimony from a Secret Service agent who confronted the gunman on the course.</p>
