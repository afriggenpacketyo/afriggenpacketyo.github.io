          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major, long-term contract valued at $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, significantly boosted the company's share price, though the identity of the counterparty remains confidential to protect trade secrets. This development comes as Samsung aims to strengthen its position in the chip manufacturing industry, where it has faced challenges in capturing demand for AI-related components compared to its competitors. The company has advised investors to remain cautious due to the confidential nature of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service took an individual into custody after they climbed a fence at the Treasury Building, which is adjacent to the White House. The suspect dropped a bag that was later cleared by an explosive disposal team, prompting a significant law enforcement response. The individual was hospitalized for a medical evaluation and faces charges of unlawful entry.

          <p>A 34-year-old Wyandotte County Sheriff's Deputy, Elijah Ming, was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Kansas City, Kansas. The nine-year veteran was assisting a woman moving out of a residence when a man inside opened fire without warning. The suspect, who also fired at other responding officers, was wounded in a subsequent gunfight and surrendered after an hour-long standoff with police negotiators.

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union, which establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, is projected to cause a significant drop in global exports to the U.S. According to an economic complexity simulator, this could lead to a 46% decrease in global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent averages. The model suggests that countries will rewire trade relationships away from the U.S., with China expected to significantly reduce its exports to America while increasing imports from nations like Russia and Vietnam. Logistics experts warn that the tariffs will make many products more expensive for U.S. consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The party, using a "Japan First" slogan, has capitalized on public frustration with economic issues like inflation and high rice prices, as well as rising anti-immigrant and anti-tourist sentiment. This shift has put pressure on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which lost its majority in the upper house.

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his witty and incisive songs in the 1950s and 60s, has passed away at the age of 97. Lehrer, a Harvard-educated mathematician, gained fame with his piano-driven comedy that cleverly targeted politics, the nuclear arms race, and societal norms. After a successful but relatively brief career in the public eye, he largely retired from performing in the 1970s to focus on teaching mathematics. His work, including songs like "The Vatican Rag" and "Pollution," left a lasting legacy and influenced generations of comedic songwriters.</p>

          <p>Police officers who were first to respond to the deadly 2024 stabbing attack at a Southport dance studio have shared their experiences of confronting the killer. Sgt Greg Gillespie and PC Luke Holden described arriving at a scene of terror and making the split-second decision to enter the building without waiting for armed backup. They came face-to-face with the 17-year-old assailant, who was holding a blood-stained knife but ultimately acted cowardly when confronted. The attack claimed the lives of three young girls and seriously injured others, leaving a lasting mark on the officers and the community.</p>

          <p>Archaeological discoveries at the Keeladi site in India's Tamil Nadu state have ignited a fierce political and historical debate. Artifacts estimated to be up to 2,500 years old suggest the existence of an ancient, literate urban civilization in southern India, challenging the long-held narrative of northern-centric development in the subcontinent. Some archaeologists claim the findings, including a script potentially older than Ashokan Brahmi, could rewrite early Indian history. The issue has become a symbol of Tamil pride, fueling tensions between the state and the federal government over control of the historical narrative.</p>

          <p>Argentina's new government, led by President Javier Milei, has implemented sweeping budget cuts that have resulted in mass layoffs at human rights organizations and government agencies. These groups, many housed at the former ESMA detention center, are dedicated to documenting the crimes of the country's military dictatorship and finding children who were stolen at birth. Key institutions like the National Archive of Remembrance have seen their staff decimated, threatening their ability to support criminal prosecutions and preserve historical memory. Activists and survivors are protesting the cuts, fearing a regression in the nation's decades-long efforts for truth and justice.</p>

          <p>An investigation by an Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist successfully tracked down a Skyvan airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights" in the 1970s. The plane, found in the U.S. and later returned to Argentina as a museum piece, was used to throw political prisoners alive into the Atlantic Ocean. By deciphering the plane's flight logs, investigators were able to document the missions and link them to specific disappearances, including a group of the founding Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. This evidence proved crucial in the 2017 conviction of dozens of officials for crimes against humanity.</p>

          <p>England's Euro 2025 victory is being hailed as a triumph of resilience, as the team overcame multiple knockout-stage challenges to defend their title.

Despite Spain dominating possession and shots in the final, England's tactical discipline and ability to score late, often with substitutes, proved decisive. Pundits and players noted that while England may have had some luck, their fighting spirit and strategic planning made them deserving champions.</p>

          <p>Three years after the X-Press Pearl cargo ship disaster off Sri Lanka's coast, a BBC investigation reveals a lasting and worsening toxic legacy. The billions of plastic pellets, or nurdles, that washed ashore have become contaminated with pollutants from the ocean, acting like chemical sponges. New research shows these nurdles contain toxic metals like arsenic and lead, which can be passed up the food chain. Local fishermen report a drastic decline in fish populations, and an environmental assessment estimates the total damage at over $6 billion, far exceeding the compensation paid by the ship's owner.</p>
