          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' estimates and indicating that consumption remains a concern for the country's economy. Despite the slowdown in retail sales, industrial output grew by 6.1%, exceeding expectations. Fixed-asset investment also saw growth, though slightly below forecasts, with the real estate sector experiencing a significant decline. These economic data points come against the backdrop of ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S., despite recent agreements to roll back tariffs temporarily. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are trying again to push President Trump's budget package forward after facing a setback due to conservative opposition regarding spending cuts. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while making changes to taxes on tips and overtime, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Conservatives are pushing for stricter work requirements for Medicaid recipients and an end to clean energy subsidies, while some Republicans from blue states are demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Mr. Trump has urged Republicans to finalize the bill.</p>

          <p>A deal has been reached to end New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years, with NJ Transit and the union announcing the agreement on Sunday. While trains will not resume running a full schedule until Tuesday, the strike has brought significant relief to commuters. The engineers' union had been seeking pay parity with their counterparts at other railroads. State officials are asking commuters to work from home on Monday to allow for safety inspections and track assessments before service resumes.</p>

Symptoms, treatments, and potential outcomes are being discussed, emphasizing the importance of tailored medical decisions and the possibility of managing the disease to slow progression and preserve quality of life.

          <p>The United States is likely to introduce region-based tariffs instead of individual duty rates for many countries, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday. The administration of President Donald Trump is now aiming to strike deals with select key trading partners on its sweeping so-called reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. The secretary said he expects to "do a lot of regional deals." Trump paused the country-specific tariffs for 90 days until early July to allow for negotiations, but his officials have struggled to make progress on so many deals in the time available.</p>
