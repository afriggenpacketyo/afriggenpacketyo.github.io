          <p>The Navy reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. However, the Pentagon's review found only about 20 books requiring removal pending further assessment by a Department of Defense panel. Most of the originally pulled books have been returned to circulation, aligning the Navy's policy with the Pentagon's standardized approach.</p>

          <p>Homeowners insurance costs are rising dramatically in states within Tornado Alley, with hail, not tornadoes, being the primary driver of increased premiums. Insurance companies are raising rates due to the growing expenses associated with extreme weather disasters. While tornadoes pose a significant threat to life, hail causes widespread damage across larger areas, breaking windows, tearing off siding, and damaging roofs. Climate change is contributing to more extreme weather, including the potential for larger hailstones, prompting insurers to scale back coverage and increase rates to mitigate risks.</p>

          <p>Memorial Day Weekend travel is projected to break records, with AAA estimating 45.1 million people traveling at least 50 miles from home. Most travelers are expected to drive or fly, with concerns over crowded roads and airport lines. Travelers are advised to prepare for potential disruptions, including new restrictions on lithium batteries, and to arrive at the airport early. Despite safety and economic concerns, gas prices are the lowest they've been for Memorial Day Weekend since 2021, offering some relief for drivers.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered that clownfish shrink in response to extreme ocean heat waves, a phenomenon observed during a severe event in Papua New Guinea. The fish, measured over several months, decreased in size, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter temperatures. While climate change negatively impacts marine life, this shrinking adaptation may help clownfish endure these conditions, adding complexity to the understanding of how species respond to environmental changes.</p>
