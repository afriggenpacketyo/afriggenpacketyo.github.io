          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a potential new 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This statement came as the BRICS nations met in Brazil, issuing a joint declaration that criticized unilateral protectionist measures and trade-distorting tariffs. The threat escalates global trade tensions, targeting a bloc that includes major economies like China, Russia, and India, and has recently expanded to include several other nations from the Global South.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The nine-week trial concluded with a guilty verdict for three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, with Patterson facing a potential life sentence. Prosecutors argued she intentionally poisoned the beef Wellington dish, citing her calculated deceptions and cover-up attempts, while the defense maintained it was a tragic accident followed by panic-induced lies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump strongly criticized Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, the "America Party," calling the tech billionaire a "train wreck" who has gone "off the rails." The public feud marks a dramatic falling out between the former allies, stemming from disagreements over a recent tax and spending bill that ended EV tax credits. Trump asserted that third parties only create chaos, while Musk launched the party in response to what he views as fiscally irresponsible policies from both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, prompting the cancellation of storm warnings. However, the system continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas and into Virginia as it moves northeast. Forecasters predict heavy rainfall, with localized amounts up to six inches, which has already led to dozens of flooded roads and a highway collapse in Chatham County, North Carolina, as rivers surge to near-record levels.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has found no evidence of a supposed "client list" associated with the deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein. The memo, reviewed by ABC News, also states that investigators uncovered no evidence to predicate new charges against any uncharged third parties. Furthermore, officials released footage that they say confirms Epstein's death was a suicide, directly contradicting widespread conspiracy theories about his death and the existence of a list of powerful associates.</p>

          <p>Around the world, women are having fewer children than ever before, a trend driven by factors like increased economic independence and changing life priorities. This demographic shift is causing the global fertility rate to plummet, raising concerns about future depopulation and its impact on economies, workforces, and social safety nets like Social Security. While some view the trend as a positive outcome of women's empowerment, it has also sparked a political debate over pronatalist policies aimed at encouraging higher birth rates.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how large-scale institutional investment in residential real estate is fueling a severe housing crisis across Europe, making homeownership and affordable rent unattainable for many. It argues that since the 2008 financial crisis, private equity firms and other investors have treated housing as a lucrative asset class, driving up prices while profiting from shortages. This financialization of a basic human need is exacerbating inequality and fueling political disenfranchisement and the rise of far-right movements.</p>

          <p>The most recent round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, held in Doha, has concluded without achieving a breakthrough on a ceasefire agreement. Mediators from Qatar and Egypt shuttled messages between the two delegations, but significant gaps remain. Hamas continues to insist on a guaranteed end to the war, a condition Israel has repeatedly rejected, as it remains committed to dismantling the militant group's capabilities. Talks are expected to resume amid ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in their battle against the Madre fire, which has burned over 80,000 acres in San Luis Obispo County, making it the largest wildfire in California so far this year. Aided by an influx of personnel and more favorable weather conditions, crews have increased containment to 30%. The blaze poses a threat to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to endangered species, but officials are optimistic as they work to control the fire ahead of a predicted heatwave.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to amend its Employment Rights Bill to legally entitle parents to bereavement leave if they experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, this right is only granted for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner announced the change, stating that it will give people who suffer the heartbreak of early pregnancy loss the necessary time away from work to grieve before they are ready to return.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost educational standards and attract talent where it is most needed, the UK government will offer tax-free payments of £4,500 to qualified early years teachers who work in 20 designated disadvantaged areas. This incentive is a key part of a new £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at narrowing the educational attainment gap among preschool children. The plan addresses the fact that only about one in ten nurseries currently employ a specialist early years teacher.</p>
