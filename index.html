          <h2>Paul Tudor Jones Predicts New Stock Market Lows Despite Potential Tariff Reduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:09:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones anticipates the stock market will decline to new lows, even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China. Jones cites Trump's focus on tariffs and the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates as factors detrimental to market performance. He suggests that dialing back tariffs to 50% would still represent a significant tax increase, impacting economic growth. Jones gained recognition for predicting the 1987 stock market crash and currently chairs the nonprofit Just Capital, which assesses U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.

          <p>Current mortgage rates are averaging around 6.89% for a 30-year mortgage and 6.11% for a 15-year mortgage, while refinance rates are similar, highlighting the challenges for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Experts suggest that borrowers may find some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes. To secure a favorable rate, it's crucial to strengthen your credit profile by paying bills on time and addressing any errors on your credit report. Shopping around and comparing different lenders is also essential to find the most suitable terms and rates for your individual financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, failed to secure a majority in the initial parliament vote for chancellor, receiving only 310 of the required 316 votes. This unprecedented failure in modern German political history has created confusion and uncertainty within the parliament. Despite his coalition with the center-left having enough seats, dissenting members seemingly undermined his bid, leading to a second vote scheduled for later that day. The historic nature of this defeat could tarnish Merz's image and complicate his efforts to unify a divided government.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that a majority of respondents believe the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year and next in response to a weakening economy, despite concerns about higher inflation. The survey forecasts the Fed funds rate to decline to 3.71% by year-end and 3.36% by the end of 2026. Recession odds have risen to 53%, and while inflation is expected to increase temporarily, it is projected to decline again in 2026. Some analysts believe rate cuts would signal the Fed's abandonment of its 2% inflation target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but economists anticipate the Fed will hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach, considering mixed economic signals and the impact of Trump's tariffs. Economists project the Fed could potentially slash rates at its July 30 meeting, although some expect the central bank to hold off until later in the year. Borrowers seeking relief on loan and credit card rates are likely to face a delay, as economic uncertainty persists.</p>

The memo stated that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct its movement. This contradicts Trump's assertion when invoking the Alien Enemies Act. The memo's release has further undermined the Trump administration's rationale for using the act and raises questions about its criticism of media coverage on the matter, as the Justice Department had previously opened a criminal investigation into leaks related to the matter.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Resists Labour Calls for Winter Fuel Payment Reversal</h2>

          <p>Despite growing calls within the Labour party, the UK government has insisted it will not reverse cuts to winter fuel payments, citing the need to ensure economic stability and repair public finances. The decision to restrict eligibility for the annual payments has faced criticism, especially after Labour's losses in recent local elections. Labour's Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan has urged the UK government to rethink the policy, but Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman confirmed there would be no change. The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount paid to pensioners to help with heating costs.</p>

The type of notice and hearing depends on an immigrant's status and circumstances, such as prior lawful admission, community ties, or asylum claims. Anyone claiming refuge in the U.S. must be given a hearing before an Immigration judge and a chance to appeal.</p>

          <p>Hispanic consumers are reducing their grocery spending on various items, impacting sales for companies like Coca-Cola, Constellation Brands, and Colgate-Palmolive. Concerns over stricter immigration policies and broader economic factors are contributing to this pullback. While the Hispanic population is growing and their purchasing power is significant, fears related to immigration policy are causing some consumers to cut back. This decline is evident in reduced spending on social gatherings and non-alcoholic beverages, affecting the bottom lines of major consumer brands.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala, raising a record $31 million, celebrated the Costume Institute’s exhibition “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” examining 300 years of Black fashion and dandyism.

The Costume Institute has also faced criticism for its lack of a Black curator and its own history of racism. Celebrities, designers, and stylists showcased daring and memorable looks, highlighting Black talent in the fashion world.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but suspended its 2025 financial guidance, citing an anticipated $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs. The automaker expects to offset $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions and volume/pricing strategies, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion. Ford cited near-term risks, including potential supply chain disruptions and increased tariffs, as reasons for pulling its guidance. The tariff impact is less than that projected by General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles.</p>
