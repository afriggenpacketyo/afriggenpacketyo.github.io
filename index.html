        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, primarily targeting the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the EPA. These cuts are intended to yield "significant savings" according to OMB Director Russell Vought, while still protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure. However, the proposal also calls for a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion towards the southern border. The proposal has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, with concerns raised about defense funding levels and the impact of cuts on vital programs for working Americans.</p>

Cybersecurity experts question the security of this alternative app, noting that it may route information through Israel, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout has been placed on the 10-day injured list due to a bone bruise in his left knee, sustained during a game against the Seattle Mariners.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption, which previously allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, is set to increase prices on goods imported from China. Retailers like Shein and Temu, who relied on this loophole, are expected to raise prices, impacting U.S. consumers who benefited from lower-cost goods. Trade experts also anticipate administrative challenges for importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection due to the increased volume of packages requiring inspection, potentially causing delays in shipments. While U.S.-made goods might see less competition, consumers are likely to experience higher costs and reduced availability of certain products.</p>

          <p>Ronan, a 15-year-old California sea lion, has reaffirmed her exceptional rhythmic abilities in a new study, demonstrating her ability to move to a beat better than humans. Researchers at New College of Florida tested Ronan's ability to synchronize with percussion beats at varying tempos, confirming her unique talent for recognizing and responding to rhythms. This research reinforces the idea that the ability to recognize a beat is not exclusive to humans and vocal-learning animals. Ronan's performance highlights the complex cognitive abilities of sea lions and challenges previous assumptions about animal musicality.</p>
