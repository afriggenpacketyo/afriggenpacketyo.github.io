          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. Vice President JD Vance met in New Delhi, where they acknowledged the significant advancements in trade negotiations between India and the United States. Both leaders expressed positive views on the progress made in various areas of bilateral cooperation, including energy, defense, and strategic technologies, and emphasized the importance of continued dialogue and diplomacy. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer highlighted the need for reciprocity in the trade relationship but welcomed India's constructive engagement, aiming to create new opportunities for workers and businesses in both nations. The two countries aim to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is causing central banks worldwide to carefully consider whether to devalue their own currencies. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, potentially allowing for interest rate cuts, it also complicates export competitiveness and could provoke retaliatory measures. Emerging markets face additional risks such as high inflation, debt, and capital flight, making devaluation a dangerous option. For now, most central banks are avoiding a currency war, which could further destabilize the global economy, but they must balance the benefits of a weaker currency against potential economic and political repercussions.</p>

          <p>China saw a significant increase in the number of newly established private companies during the first quarter of the year, with nearly 2 million firms registered. This growth, higher than the average of the past three years, indicates resilience in the private sector despite challenges from the US-China trade war. Private businesses account for a substantial portion of China's exports and overall trade value, making them vulnerable to tariffs. The data suggests a continued expansion of private enterprise in China, although the full impact of trade tensions remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn following President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he labeled a "major loser." The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all fell sharply as investors grappled with tariff uncertainty and awaited tech earnings reports. The dollar index also weakened, while gold prices reached a record high, indicating growing investor concerns about the safety of U.S. assets. Analysts suggest that the market's reaction reflects weakening confidence among global investors due to concerns about the Fed's independence and potential disruptions to the global order.</p>

This is the fourth consecutive year of domoic acid events, but this year's started much earlier, affecting hundreds of sea lions and dolphins. Experts attribute the bloom to an upswell in the ocean, climate change, and runoff from recent fires. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin, accumulates in fish consumed by marine mammals, causing seizures and other neurological symptoms.</p>
