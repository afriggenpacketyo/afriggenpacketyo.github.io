          <p>Ban Ki-moon, former UN Secretary-General, stated the UN needs an overhaul to better address current global issues, citing the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza as examples of the need for multilateral responses. He thanked China for its role in the Paris Climate Agreement and its efforts to combat climate change. Ban also criticized the shift towards unilateralism, attributing it to the rise of "Trumpism" in the United States, which he believes has undermined the institution. The speech emphasizes the interconnectedness of global crises and the necessity for collaborative solutions. The former secretary-general is now the deputy chair of The Elders, a human rights group founded by Nelson Mandela.</p>

          <p>The rise of "SkinnyTok," a corner of the internet where thin women promote extreme dieting, is examined in this article. The author explores how this trend intersects with the body-positivity movement and the resurgence of traditional femininity ideals. SkinnyTok influencers often promote self-deprivation and are celebrated by some for their honesty, while others criticize them for promoting eating disorders. The piece also discusses the potential connection between SkinnyTok and the tradwife movement, suggesting that both can lead to more extremist viewpoints through algorithmic radicalization.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested while protesting an ICE arrest, leading to a broader discussion about the Democratic Party's response to authoritarianism. The article contrasts Lander's actions with the reactions of other Democratic leaders, some of whom seemed more concerned with property damage during protests than with the underlying issues of due process and civil rights. The author argues that Democrats should be more vocal in defending democracy in the streets and avoid being distracted by the actions of a few protesters. The piece emphasizes the importance of standing up for the rule of law and people's rights in a nonviolent yet insistent manner.</p>

          <p>This Kyodo News digest summarizes several key events, including the U.S. request for Japan to increase defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, which may cause Japan to cancel a planned meeting with Washington. It also mentions the dispatch of two SDF planes to Djibouti for potential evacuation of Japanese nationals from the Middle East due to escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Additionally, the digest notes that India's Prime Minister Modi is planning a visit to Japan in August for a bullet train deal, and Chinese ships were spotted near the Senkaku Islands for a record-tying 215th straight day. The digest also touches on the launch of a joint venture for a Japan-Britain-Italy fighter jet project.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product, a demand that could lead to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting with Washington. This request, reportedly made by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy, is likely to cause Japan to call off the meeting of foreign and defense chiefs scheduled in Washington before Japan's House of Councillors election. The meeting would have been the first since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump took office. In 2022, Japan decided to double its annual defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece alleges that broadcast networks exhibited bias by skipping a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing investigating former President Joe Biden's fitness for office. The author contrasts this with the extensive coverage given to the House Special Committee on the January 6 attack, which was favored by Democrats. The piece argues that the media's "news judgment" is closely aligned with Democratic objectives and that they are attempting to bury news unfavorable to the party. The author concludes that this bias underscores the importance of conservative and independent media in covering stories that liberals want to suppress.</p>

In 'Materialists,' one of the main character's clients is assaulted, leading the protagonist to confront her cynical approach to dating and love. While not as exploitative as 'Showgirls,' the author finds the execution cynical and ultimately disappointing, highlighting the film's failure to connect its challenging ideas without resorting to retrograde tropes.</p>

Cuban also suggests requiring providers to honor publicly listed cash prices, banning specialty drug pricing tiers, and making provider CEOs personally liable for billing fraud.

          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is expected to develop the ability to carry out "deck load strikes," a type of swarm attack. This capability could help China's navy gain a first-mover advantage in combat. The Fujian has been progressing steadily in sea trials since its first test in May of last year and is expected to be commissioned by the end of the year. This will join the Liaoning and Shandong to form a three-carrier fleet for the Chinese navy.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the internal conflicts within Trump's coalition over the possibility of war with Iran. It highlights a contentious interview between Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz, exposing divisions within the Maga movement. While Cruz supports potential military action, others within the movement, like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Steve Bannon, oppose further involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts. The article suggests that these divisions could lead to the self-destruction of the Maga movement, especially if Trump decides to engage in another endless war.</p>

As a result, Japan's overall dependence on Chinese rare earths has dropped to below 60% from more than 90% at the time of the incident.
