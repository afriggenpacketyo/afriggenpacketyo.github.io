        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office has announced the expansion of live facial recognition (LFR) technology, deploying ten new vans across seven police forces in England. This technology, which scans faces and compares them against wanted lists, is intended to help locate suspects for serious crimes like sexual offences and homicide. While the government cites its success in London, privacy advocates from groups like Big Brother Watch have condemned the move as an alarming expansion of the surveillance state and are pursuing legal challenges against its use.</p>

          <p>The National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police to release the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases to combat misinformation and enhance public trust. This change aims to bring consistency to a process that was previously at the discretion of individual forces, a situation highlighted by recent riots fueled by false online rumors. While the government supports the move for transparency, some critics, including a former police superintendent, warn it could create an expectation for disclosure in every case and lead to unintended consequences.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's recent actions, which project a strongman image aimed at energizing his base and consolidating power. Examples cited include firing a Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over unfavorable job numbers, ordering criminal investigations into political rivals like Letitia James, and taking control of the Washington D.C. police force. The author notes that Trump carries out these controversial moves openly, reinforcing his image as a fighter who is unafraid to challenge established political and legal norms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research is challenging the prevailing trend of programming AI and robots to be exclusively cheerful and extraverted, instead exploring the potential benefits of more neurotic or anxious personalities. Inspired by famous characters like C-3PO, scientists are experimenting with different temperaments to understand what makes a robot more relatable and trustworthy to humans. This work delves into the complex field of human-robot interaction, questioning whether a wider range of programmed personalities could lead to more effective and engaging artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Nine-time Grand Slam champion Monica Seles has publicly revealed her diagnosis with myasthenia gravis, a rare neuromuscular autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness. The 51-year-old former world number one decided to share her condition to raise awareness ahead of the US Open, after first noticing symptoms like double vision several years ago. Seles, whose legendary career was famously interrupted after she was stabbed during a match in 1993, noted the condition significantly affects her day-to-day life.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders are set to hold a virtual call with U.S. President Donald Trump to reinforce their position ahead of his summit with Vladimir Putin. The leaders aim to pressure Trump to side with Ukraine and reiterate that no decisions, especially regarding territorial changes, should be made without Kyiv's involvement. This comes amid concerns sparked by Trump's comments about a potential "swapping of territories" and as Russia intensifies its military offensive to gain leverage before the talks.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The summit will be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a major U.S. military installation. The choice of Alaska, which the U.S. purchased from Russia in 1867, adds a layer of historical resonance to the high-stakes talks, which were announced after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face further sanctions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of 800 National Guard troops and taken control of the city's police force, citing the need to combat what he calls out-of-control violent crime in Washington D.C. On Tuesday, armored vehicles and troops appeared at key locations, a move that D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has strongly condemned as an "authoritarian push." The White House has stated that this is just the beginning of a month-long federal operation to arrest violent criminals in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in suspended science research grants to UCLA. The judge ruled that the National Science Foundation's abrupt freezing of over $584 million in funds violated a prior injunction, differing from a termination "in name only." The administration had suspended the grants, which fund studies in areas like cancer and clean energy, citing allegations of antisemitism and discrimination at the university, a move critics called political hostage-taking.</p>

          <p>An investigation has found that a new immigration detention center in Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is holding individuals who are not criminals, including DACA recipients. This contradicts the Trump administration's claims that the facility would be used for "the worst of the worst" undocumented immigrants with criminal records. The report highlights that nearly half of all people detained by ICE in June lacked a criminal record, raising alarms among immigration advocates about the scope and targets of the administration's enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>An annual human rights report produced by the Trump administration has asserted that the human rights situation in the United Kingdom "worsened" over the past year. The report specifically points to what it describes as growing restrictions on freedom of expression and government censorship, highlighting the response to the 2024 Southport riots and the implementation of buffer zones around abortion clinics. A UK government spokesperson defended its record, stating it upholds freedoms while also ensuring the safety of its citizens.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen has been dealt another significant blow, as relief pitcher Brock Stewart has been placed on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation.
