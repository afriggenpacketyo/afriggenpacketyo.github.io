          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, arguing its primary objective has been to maintain Israel's military and technological dominance. It cites a U.S. senator's candid admission that the goal was to reduce any regional rival to a "pre-industrial society," a policy that allegedly intensified after the September 11 attacks. The piece suggests this long-standing agenda, once advocated by neoconservatives, has shaped decades of American actions in the region. This perspective frames recent events not as isolated incidents but as part of a continuous strategic pursuit.</p>

          <p>China's solar panel industry is confronting a severe downturn, marked by a recent industry conference in Shanghai with notably lower attendance and absent CEOs. The sector is struggling with a dual crisis: a domestic supply glut causing a price war and significant financial losses, alongside prohibitive U.S. tariffs that are blocking crucial export markets. According to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, prices across the supply chain have fallen by 60-80% in 2024, pushing many firms into the red. This downturn has caused the stock values of major solar companies to plummet significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh has been added to a class-action lawsuit against the University of Michigan concerning a former assistant, Matt Weiss. The suit alleges Harbaugh and other officials knew Weiss was improperly accessing private computer data but allowed him to coach in a major playoff game in December 2022. Weiss has been criminally charged with identity theft and unauthorized computer access, allegedly obtaining private images of over 2,000 college athletes. The lawsuit claims that with proper oversight, the misconduct could have been prevented, prioritizing a high-stakes game over student welfare.</p>

In a social media post, Araghchi stated that respect is a prerequisite for any potential deal and threatened that Iran would not hesitate to "unveil its Real Capabilities" if challenged. The warning comes after a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, which included U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Tensions remain high despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, with both leaders exchanging sharp words.</p>

Their departure, which was marked by a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors, leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo.

This marks a change from the past four years, where the leaders had attended at the alliance's invitation. According to experts, this decision reflects a growing concern in the Indo-Pacific that the United States is becoming distracted by conflicts in the Middle East.

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' reinforced flood protection system are sinking at an alarming rate, in some areas nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is occurring faster than sea-level rise, potentially degrading the city's defenses against storm surges, twenty years after Hurricane Katrina. Researchers used satellite radar data to identify sinking hotspots, particularly around industrial sites and new developments, likely due to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a critical warning, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city.</p>

Long-standing CDC experts appeared to struggle against what was characterized as challenges to their methodology.

          <p>In a major 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such sweeping orders exceed the authority granted to federal courts.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, a change the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would leave millions uninsured nationwide. Newsom stated the cuts would be "reckless and cruel," potentially forcing the closure of rural hospitals and driving up insurance premiums for others. The proposed changes would require states to establish complex verification systems, and failure to comply could result in the loss of federal Medicaid funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and a lower incidence of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, surveying nearly 12,500 employees. While 30.9% of the total cohort showed depressive symptoms, those who adhered more closely to a Japanese diet were less likely to report them. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, prevalent in the diet, may play a role in supporting mental well-being.</p>

Phage therapy is a century-old idea that was largely abandoned with the advent of antibiotics but is now being revisited as superbugs become more common.

          <p>In the closing arguments of Sean "Diddy" Combs's sex-trafficking trial, his defense team argued that the prosecution has unfairly criminalized his "swinger" lifestyle. Lead counsel Marc Agnifilo told the jury that Combs is the victim of a "fake trial" where his consensual sexual preferences were distorted to appear as a racketeering conspiracy. The defense characterized relationships with key witnesses as transactional and consensual, suggesting the case is about money, not crime. The prosecution countered that Combs believed himself to be "above the law" and urged the jury to hold him accountable.</p>

Cramer also noted that the upcoming Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates.

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over West Indies in the first Test match, driven by a powerful bowling performance from Josh Hazlewood. On the third day of the match in Barbados, the West Indies' batting lineup collapsed dramatically in the evening session, losing all ten of their wickets. Hazlewood was the chief architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the hosts' top order. Despite some late resistance, Australia's bowlers wrapped up the match with two full days to spare, showcasing their clinical efficiency and control.</p>
