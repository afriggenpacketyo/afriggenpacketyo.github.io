          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border, causing widespread devastation and killing at least 800 people, with an additional 1,800 injured. Rescue operations are underway, utilizing helicopters to search for survivors in remote villages where many are feared to be trapped under rubble. The Taliban government has appealed for international aid to manage the crisis, which is compounded by the nation's existing struggles with drought and hunger. This disaster represents one of the deadliest earthquakes to hit the seismically active country in recent years.</p>

          <p>A new Netflix documentary, "America’s Team: the Gambler and his Cowboys," is earning acclaim for its raw and comprehensive portrayal of the Dallas Cowboys' dynasty in the 1990s. The series delves into the team's on-field success and off-field controversies, featuring candid interviews with key figures like owner Jerry Jones, coach Jimmy Johnson, and star player Michael Irvin. Unlike many polished sports documentaries, this series explores gritty topics such as player misconduct, internal feuds, and health issues with remarkable openness. The article suggests its unflinching approach offers a more complete and compelling narrative than other popular sports hagiographies.</p>

          <p>The volume of Chinese stocks purchased with borrowed money has surged to a record 2.28 trillion yuan (US$319.2 billion), surpassing a previous peak set just before a market crash. This increase in margin buying, primarily driven by leveraged hedge funds and retail traders, signals rising market sentiment but also raises concerns about potential overheating. Analysts note that while the activity reflects a liquidity-driven rally, the rapid rise in stock prices for certain tech companies has prompted warnings about investment risks. The trend highlights growing speculative activity within mainland China's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating landslide has obliterated the village of Tarasin in Sudan's Darfur region, with a local rebel group reporting an estimated 1,000 fatalities and only a single survivor. The disaster, triggered by days of heavy rainfall, occurred in the Marrah Mountains, an area that has become a refuge for people displaced by the country's ongoing civil war. Access for humanitarian aid is severely restricted due to the conflict, complicating rescue and recovery efforts. Both the rebel group controlling the area and the regional governor have issued urgent appeals for international assistance to address the immense tragedy.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, choosing him over the more experienced Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. This decision aligns with the club's "Project 150" strategy, which aims to build a title-contending team by its 150th anniversary in 2028. While Martinez is a proven Premier League talent, United's data analysis highlighted Lammens' exceptional potential in key metrics like shot-stopping and distribution for his age group. The move represents a calculated risk, prioritizing future development over immediate, proven experience as the club rebuilds under its new leadership.</p>

The crisis is rooted in decades of socioeconomic challenges, including deindustrialization and poverty, which have contributed to widespread addiction and despair.

          <p>Belgium's Foreign Minister has announced that the country will officially recognize an independent Palestinian state at the upcoming UN General Assembly. The decision is part of an effort to increase pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas amid the ongoing conflict, which the minister described as a "humanitarian tragedy." This move follows recent Israeli strikes in Gaza City that killed 13 people, according to Gaza's civil defense agency. Belgium joins a growing list of countries, including France, Canada, and Australia, that have declared their intention to recognize Palestinian statehood, a move Israel has repeatedly condemned.</p>

          <p>The sport of pickleball is experiencing a significant surge in popularity in China, mirroring the trend seen in the United States. Online sales of pickleball equipment in the country have increased more than six-fold compared to the previous year, reflecting a broader cultural shift towards active lifestyles. The sport's growth is being fueled by social media influencers and a renewed interest in racquet sports generally. This has created new business opportunities, with for-profit courts being built and a more systematized development of the sport under the national Chinese Tennis Association.</p>

          <p>Utah has launched an ambitious initiative to build 35,000 affordable starter homes in five years to combat a severe housing crisis that has pushed homeownership out of reach for many young residents. However, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. The state has offered incentives like low-interest construction loans, but experts argue that without bolder zoning reforms to allow for smaller, denser housing, the impact will be limited. Despite the challenges, some developers are embracing the program, creating new, lower-cost homes that offer a crucial entry point into the housing market for first-time buyers.</p>

          <p>Legendary coach Bill Belichick's first game as head coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels resulted in a significant 48-14 home loss to the TCU Horned Frogs. Despite an initial touchdown drive that energized the Chapel Hill crowd, the Tar Heels were overwhelmed by TCU's offense and defense. TCU scored 41 unanswered points, capitalizing on turnovers, including an interception returned for a touchdown and a fumble recovery for another score. The lopsided defeat marks a challenging start for Belichick's highly anticipated transition to college football, highlighting the work ahead for the UNC program.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre have designed a compact, detergent-free washing machine for use in space, addressing the challenge of cleaning clothes on long-duration missions. The device, slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase, uses a combination of ultrasonic mist and ozone to clean and sterilize clothing. It requires only 400ml of water per cycle, a crucial feature given that water is a scarce resource in space. This innovation could significantly improve hygiene and comfort for astronauts by allowing them to reuse clothing multiple times during their missions.</p>

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the U.S., and its expansion highlights a growing public health challenge. Officials are urging residents to take preventative measures, such as using repellent and checking for ticks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>New policies included in President Trump's tax law are now resulting in significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), affecting food purchasing power for over 40 million low-income Americans. With an estimated 2.4 million fewer people expected to receive benefits, families could lose between $72 and $231 per month. Grocers are bracing for the impact, with large discount retailers like Walmart potentially benefiting as consumers trade down to stretch their budgets. However, independent and small-chain grocery stores, particularly those in low-income areas, are expected to face significant financial strain. (not investment advice)</p>
