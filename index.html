          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, the first major piece of stablecoin legislation, which is now awaiting the president's signature. This legislative milestone has boosted market sentiment, contributing to a significant rally for Ether, which has outperformed Bitcoin with a 19% weekly gain. Ether-based ETFs also saw record inflows, surpassing those of Bitcoin for the first time, signaling a potential shift in crypto market leadership. Analysts suggest this momentum could mark a trend reversal, establishing a more favorable regulatory and investment environment for the digital asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI personnel reviewing files related to Jeffrey Epstein were instructed to "flag" any records that mentioned President Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin alleged that this review process was haphazard and involved personnel who lacked the necessary expertise. The claim adds to the political pressure on the Trump administration regarding the handling and release of the Epstein case files. The senator's office stated the information came from an internal source, raising further questions about the impartiality of the file review.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East Los Angeles has resulted in the deaths of at least three police officers. The blast occurred in the parking lot of the Special Enforcement Bureau, which is the department's specialized tactical unit. While the exact cause is still under investigation, sources suggest the officers were handling unexploded ordnance from a recent bomb disposal call when it detonated. Federal agencies, including the ATF and DHS, have been deployed to assist in the investigation of the "horrific" incident.</p>

          <p>The European Union has adopted a new, stringent package of sanctions against Russia, aimed at crippling its ability to fund the war in Ukraine. The measures include a dynamic price cap on Russian oil, a ban on future transactions via Nord Stream pipelines, and an import ban on refined petroleum products made from Russian crude in third countries. Additionally, the EU has sanctioned more Russian banks and entities, including some in China and Turkey, for supplying dual-use technologies. Experts note these sanctions effectively "kill" the Nord Stream pipelines and create significant long-term economic pressure on Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has imposed several restrictions on former President Jair Bolsonaro, including requiring him to wear an ankle monitor and cease communication with diplomats. The measures are intended to prevent him from fleeing the country amid an ongoing trial for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2022 election results. This development occurs as U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly supported Bolsonaro and threatened significant tariffs on Brazilian imports to pressure authorities. The court's order also stems from a separate investigation into Bolsonaro's son, who is accused of collaborating with U.S. officials to sanction Brazilian judges.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the airline industry shows that Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly dominating the market, accounting for over 86% of profits among the top seven carriers last year. Their success is attributed to strong global networks and a strategic focus on premium travel, which has helped them weather challenges like falling domestic airfares. While other carriers struggle with an oversupply of coach seats, Delta and United are bolstered by revenue from premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs. This growing separation highlights a significant performance gap within the U.S. airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New 'No Tax on Tips' Law Creates Uncertainty for Workers and Employers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly enacted "no tax on tips" provision, part of a larger bill, is creating questions about its implementation and who qualifies for the tax break. The law provides a deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income but does not eliminate taxes entirely, as payroll and state taxes still apply. The IRS is expected to release clarifying guidance in October, but for now, tax professionals and workers are uncertain about which occupations will be eligible. Further complexity arises from changes to income reporting thresholds, which could affect how workers properly report their tips to qualify for the deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the life and work of Andrea Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado who died recently. Gibson was celebrated for their intensely confessional and emotional spoken-word poetry, which addressed topics of queerness, anxiety, and love. They gained prominence through online platforms like Instagram and Button Poetry, making their work highly accessible to a broad audience beyond traditional poetry readers. The piece highlights how Gibson's straightforward and unabashedly sentimental style was a key feature of their art, allowing them to forge a powerful connection with listeners and spread a message of empathy and gentleness.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that he and President Donald Trump support "maximum transparency" regarding the files on Jeffrey Epstein. His comments follow a report about a "bawdy" letter allegedly signed by Trump in an album for Epstein, which the president has denied and called "patently absurd." Amid pressure from both parties, Trump announced he has asked the Attorney General to release grand jury testimony, though such records are typically sealed. The situation underscores the political dilemma for Republicans as they navigate their base's demands for information and a president who dismisses the theories as a hoax.</p>

          <p>The number of serious pollution incidents caused by water companies in the United Kingdom has increased by 60% in a single year, according to a recent report. This sharp rise in environmental damage has fueled public anger and intensified scrutiny of the water industry's performance and regulation. The incidents, which can include major sewage spills and chemical contamination, have significant negative impacts on rivers, wildlife, and public health. The data highlights a growing crisis in the management of the UK's waterways and raises questions about corporate accountability and governmental oversight of the sector.</p>

          <p>The UK government's spending on hotels to house asylum seekers decreased by nearly a third in the last fiscal year, falling from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. This reduction was primarily driven by a lower average nightly cost per person, achieved by moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations and implementing room-sharing policies. However, the report also confirms that £270 million paid to Rwanda for the now-scrapped deportation scheme was not refunded. Experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could reverse these savings and lead to a renewed reliance on costly hotel accommodations.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on 18 Russian intelligence officers and three military intelligence (GRU) units for conducting a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity. The Foreign Office stated the spies were working to "destabilise Europe" and had targeted UK media, infrastructure, and political institutions. This action was coordinated with the European Union, which announced its own new, stringent sanctions against Russia's energy and banking sectors. The UK sanctions aim to disrupt Russia's hybrid warfare tactics, which are seen as a response to the UK's continued support for Ukraine.</p>

The woman, Kayla Elliott, said she was told the couple had been unable to conceive a second child, but later learned they had allegedly arranged for numerous women to carry embryos for them simultaneously. The investigation expanded after Xuan and Zhang were arrested on child endangerment charges related to a nanny allegedly abusing an infant. Twenty-one children are now in protective care, and Elliott is fighting for custody of the baby she delivered.</p>

          <p>A contributor for the Los Angeles Times argues that the Democratic Party is in a state of structural decline and spiraling into irrelevance, citing record-low approval ratings. The author contends that the party's focus on "woke grievances" and "intersectional obsessions" has alienated large segments of the American electorate. The piece points to the rise of figures like New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a self-described communist, as evidence that the party is moving further leftward, away from the concerns of mainstream Americans. The author concludes that this trajectory will only lead to continued political failure for the party.</p>

          <p>An Iranian father, Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the parking lot of his child's preschool in Oregon. ICE stated he was arrested for overstaying his visa and that he resisted, requiring agents to break a car window to complete the arrest. However, an immigration lawyer claims Khanbabazadeh was in legal status, having transitioned from a student visa and applied for a green card after marrying a U.S. citizen. The incident, which took place in front of other parents, has been described as chaotic and traumatic, adding to the debate over ICE's enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Recent sectarian violence in Syria, which has left hundreds dead, is being fueled by a fundamental disagreement between the United States and Israel over the country's future. The U.S. has backed a strong, centralized government under Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, while Israel, distrustful of the former jihadist, has bolstered rival minority groups like the Druze. This policy clash led to a major escalation when Sharaa's forces entered the southern province of Sweida, sparking a bloody conflict with Druze militias. The violence culminated in a dramatic Israeli bombardment of Syria's Defense Ministry, exposing deep rifts in regional strategy.</p>
