          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial school choice bill into law, allocating $1 billion for taxpayer-funded vouchers to help students attend private schools. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most private school students, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Supporters, including President Trump, hail it as a victory for parental choice, while Democrats argue it will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education. Opponents believe the bill benefits the wealthy at the expense of public-school children.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese's Labor Party has won a landslide victory in the Australian federal election, defying expectations and increasing their majority. The result has tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years. Albanese addressed key issues such as healthcare, housing affordability, climate change, and reconciliation for First Nations people. The opposition's campaign was marred by unforced errors, and Dutton has lost his own electorate.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shareholders expressed surprise at Warren Buffett's announcement that he plans to step down as CEO by the end of the year, with Greg Abel set to take over.

          <p>Florida lawmakers are attempting to provide relief to condominium owners struggling with rising costs in aging buildings while maintaining safety standards. The state legislature has sent the governor a bill that pushes back the deadline for completing structural integrity inspections and allows condo associations a two-year grace period for fully funding reserves. The bill also enables condo associations to secure loans for repairs with member approval. This action follows a 2021 collapse of a residential tower in Surfside, which led to stricter requirements on condo associations.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law making over 5 million students eligible for state funds to attend private schools, marking a significant win for conservatives. The $1 billion program provides vouchers for parents to pay for private education, making Texas the 16th state to offer public funds for private education. Advocates argue that school vouchers empower parents, while opponents claim they drain money from public schools and primarily benefit wealthier children. The law requires private school students to take standardized tests and sets limits on voucher spending for higher-income families.</p>

Many of the displaced individuals moved to a different forest nearby, highlighting the lack of long-term solutions for homelessness.
