          <p>The Trump administration has announced a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, a claim that this article suggests is based on flimsy and contested evidence. It contrasts small observational studies showing a possible association with a much larger study of 2.5 million children that found no such link after controlling for confounding factors. The article also explains that the rising rate of autism diagnoses is largely attributed by scientists to increased awareness and an expanded definition of the condition, rather than a single environmental cause.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani announced he was pulling out of a scheduled WABC-TV town hall to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by parent company ABC. Mamdani stated that it is not the government's role to pressure talk show hosts off the air, referencing the FCC chairman's comments that preceded the network's decision. The move drew criticism from a spokesperson for former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who accused Mamdani of avoiding difficult questions from local reporters under the guise of protest.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, ending an indefinite suspension that began last week. The suspension was enacted after Kimmel made comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the network deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive" amid a tense national atmosphere. The decision to pull the show had sparked significant debate over free speech, drawing criticism from other late-night hosts and industry figures, as well as praise from former President Trump.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted an unproven connection between the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and autism, announcing that the FDA will issue new guidance for physicians. This move has drawn a strong rebuttal from Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, which cited a large body of scientific literature refuting a causal link and warned of the health risks if pregnant women avoid the drug. The announcement also included the FDA's approval of leucovorin, a folate-based drug, as a potential treatment for a subset of children with autism, though its efficacy is not universally established.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for initial H-1B visa applications has created uncertainty for immigrant workers and their employers. This article clarifies that the one-time fee applies only to new applications, not renewals or current visa holders, and is intended to encourage hiring American workers. However, immigration attorneys note gray areas remain, particularly for current visa holders who travel abroad while an extension or change of employer is pending, leading them to advise against international travel until further guidance is issued.</p>

          <p>As the federal government approaches a funding deadline, President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The meeting comes after competing Republican and Democratic proposals to extend government funding failed in the Senate, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. Democratic leaders have insisted they will not support a spending bill that does not address their healthcare priorities, placing the onus on the president to negotiate a bipartisan agreement to keep the government open.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their symptoms persist or worsen after three consultations.

This guidance, while not a law, aims to improve patient safety by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer to specialists to prevent avoidable deaths.</p>

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has announced plans to furlough about one-third of its flight attendants, affecting roughly 1,800 employees, starting in December. The move is part of a broader cost-cutting effort as the airline works to regain profitability following its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in a year. The company stated that after exhausting options for voluntary leave, involuntary furloughs became necessary to rightsize the airline in response to significant reductions in its fleet and flight schedule.

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 storm in the central Atlantic, becoming the second major hurricane of the 2025 season. While not a direct threat to land, Gabrielle is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast and is expected to pass near Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring two other areas of stormy weather in the Atlantic, one of which has a high chance of developing into the next named tropical system later this week, signaling a potential ramp-up in seasonal activity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could overturn a 90-year-old precedent, *Humphrey's Executor*, which limits a president's power to fire officials at independent federal agencies without cause. The decision to take up the case follows a series of orders in which the court's conservative majority has sided with former President Trump, allowing him to remove appointees at several agencies. This case could fundamentally reshape the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches by potentially giving the president direct control over historically independent bodies.</p>

As part of the agreement, Edan On must stay away from the UCLA campus, complete community service, and participate in anti-bias training to resolve the charges stemming from the violent mob attack in May 2024.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are calling for an investigation into reports that Tom Homan, former President Trump's border czar, allegedly accepted a $50,000 cash payment from an undercover FBI agent. The alleged bribe was reportedly in exchange for the promise of future immigration-related government contracts, part of a sting operation that the Justice Department later shut down. In a letter to treasury inspectors general, Democrats urged scrutiny into whether Homan reported the income, as the White House has denied that Homan ever accepted the money.</p>

Routh, who is representing himself, questioned a firearms expert and two character witnesses before concluding his presentation. Prosecutors allege that Routh spent weeks planning the attack before being spotted by a Secret Service agent, leading to a brief confrontation before he fled. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, after which the jury will begin deliberations.</p>
