          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey announced that European troops are prepared for deployment to Ukraine if a ceasefire is brokered between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. This initiative stems from a "coalition of the willing" formed by 26 European nations to ensure Ukraine's security. Healey highlighted Russia's significant casualties and military spending, while also warning of increased conflict risks in Europe. The statement comes amidst reports of US pressure on Ukraine to cede territory and new powers for British soldiers to shoot down drones.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report indicates that the cable responsible for the deadly Lisbon funicular crash in September was substandard and did not meet the city's transport operator specifications. The incident killed 16 people and injured 21 after a carriage derailed and crashed into a building. The investigation found the underground steel haulage cable was not strong enough, having been in use for less than a year. Safety systems failed to prevent the top car from hurtling down the hill after the cable snapped, raising concerns about maintenance protocols.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has overturned a temporary restraining order, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration is likely to succeed in its appeal of a lower court's decision that had previously blocked the deployment. Oregon's Attorney General expressed strong disapproval of the ruling, pledging to continue legal efforts against the federalization of the National Guard. This decision permits the deployment for the purpose of protecting federal property amidst ongoing local protests.</p>

          <p>Demolition has reportedly begun on a section of the White House East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump's planned $250 million ballroom. The project, intended to be privately funded, has drawn widespread criticism, with some calling it an "utter desecration." Trump confirmed the groundbreaking on Truth Social and at a White House event, emphasizing it would be the "most beautiful ballroom in the country." The expansion, one of the largest White House projects in over a century, is expected to be completed by January 2029.</p>

To avert conflict, the West must "shatter the mirror" of its own historical projections and understand China's defensive rather than expansionist motivations.</p>

          <p>Halloween celebrations are expected to be more expensive this year, with U.S. consumers projected to spend a record $13.1 billion despite rising prices. Chocolate candy prices have surged due to extreme weather impacting cocoa yields in West Africa, leading to a significant supply deficit. Additionally, tariffs on imported spirits and Chinese-made costumes and decorations contribute to higher costs. Consumers are adapting by embracing budget-friendly strategies like DIY décor, buying generic candy, and shopping early to mitigate the financial impact.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth companies surged as investors reacted to Chinese export restrictions and the Trump administration's push for a domestic supply chain. President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Albanese signed an agreement to invest in joint ventures to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the administration would set price floors for these industries to combat market manipulation. This industrial policy is expected to benefit companies like NioCorp and MP Materials, with further government backing anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

With China imposing export controls, investors anticipate government support for domestic miners. Cleveland-Cliffs, already experienced in iron ore mining, aims to be part of the solution for American manufacturing independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced it will no longer investigate "non-crime hate incidents," allowing officers to focus solely on criminal investigations. This policy change follows the dropping of a probe into Father Ted creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence on X. Linehan's arrest sparked backlash and calls for legal action against the police. The Met commissioner stated officers shouldn't police "toxic culture war debates," and the move aims to provide clearer direction, though the recording of such incidents was initially recommended after the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry.</p>
