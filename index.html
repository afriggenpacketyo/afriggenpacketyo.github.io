          <p>Rod Stewart has cancelled several US concerts due to the flu, ahead of his scheduled performance at the Glastonbury Festival later in June. Stewart expressed his apologies to fans for the inconvenience and assured them of his return to the stage soon. The cancelled dates include shows in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, with plans to reschedule two California concerts. Stewart is scheduled to play the legends slot at Glastonbury, marking his first appearance at the festival since 2002, and has requested additional time to perform his extensive repertoire. The Glastonbury performance will include his former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. Optimism is present due to Stewart's anticipated recovery and future performances.</p>

          <p>A report by the Norwegian Refugee Council highlights Cameroon as facing one of the world's most neglected displacement crises, marked by a significant disparity between the severity of the situation and the political and media attention it receives. The country is grappling with over 1.1 million internally displaced people and 480,000 refugees from neighboring countries, particularly the Central African Republic. Cameroon is dealing with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western regions and instability in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants. The NRC criticizes the lack of political will and funding to address the crisis, exacerbated by budget cuts in development and humanitarian aid from major countries. The security situation needs improvement through renewed political, humanitarian, and media attention to address the challenges faced by the local population.</p>

          <p>A series of ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles led to protests and condemnation from elected officials and community members, who described the actions as cruel and terrorizing to the immigrant community. Federal agents executed search warrants at multiple locations, resulting in the arrest of dozens of individuals and one arrest for obstruction. David Huerta, president of SEIU California, was injured and detained while documenting a raid, further fueling the outrage. Protesters gathered to demand his release and condemn the immigration enforcement tactics, leading to clashes with law enforcement and the use of pepper spray and stun grenades. Elected officials have voiced their concerns and pledged to protect immigrants, while federal authorities defended their actions as enforcing the law.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement allows each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and allocates $2.7 billion to be paid over the next decade to former players who were previously barred from receiving revenue. Payouts will be determined based on the sport and length of athletic career, with some players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each. The settlement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, and it also calls for a clearinghouse to ensure NIL deals are pegged at fair market value. This decision marks a major turning point in the debate over compensating college athletes.</p>

          <p>Iran has strongly criticized the United States' renewed travel ban targeting Iranians and citizens of several other Middle Eastern and African countries, calling it a sign of a racist mentality. The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that the ban violates international law and deprives millions of people of their right to travel based on nationality or religion. The US travel ban, justified on national security grounds, affects nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, in addition to Iran. The ministry added that the policy is discriminatory and would entail international responsibility for the US government. The US is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran, with approximately 1.5 million Iranians residing there.</p>

          <p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez, outwardly a global businessman and polo club ambassador, was in reality a major drug trafficker known as "the Sultan." While appearing to be an upstanding individual, he supplied tons of heroin, methamphetamine, and hashish worldwide, informing on rival gangs to eliminate competition. A joint British and American operation led to his extradition from the UK in 2023, and he pleaded guilty to conspiring to import drugs into the US. He was sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison, with his sentence ending in 2033, after being in custody since 2017. Hafeez used his legitimate businesses to maintain a luxurious lifestyle and gain access to exclusive circles in the UK.</p>

The condition has left Jack blind, prone to seizures, and unlikely to walk or talk, with doctors indicating that it is life-limiting.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. The US Supreme Court ordered Trump to facilitate the 29-year-old's return after Washington admitted to an administrative error. Abrego Garcia faces charges related to smuggling undocumented migrants from Central America into the US between 2016 and earlier this year. His lawyer has called the criminal charges fantastical and an abuse of power, stating that the Trump administration is prosecuting him to justify their initial error.

Lee's administration is anticipated to differ from Yoon's stance on security challenges outside the Korean peninsula. During his campaign, Lee faced criticism for describing US Forces Korea as occupation forces.

          <p>Public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life, like living to 100, requires more than individual optimization through diet and exercise. Sridhar points out that life expectancy is stagnating or declining in many high-income countries despite increased knowledge about healthy living. She emphasizes the importance of public policy, infrastructure, and community in influencing health outcomes and longevity. Sridhar advocates for policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water, arguing that health should be a collective responsibility rather than an individual one.</p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant and independent from the United States and China. They aim to reduce dependencies on the US for defense and technology, on China for raw materials and cleantech goods, and on Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized the need for Europe to shape the new international order. French President Emmanuel Macron, a strong proponent of strategic autonomy, supports this vision of a more self-sufficient Europe.</p>
