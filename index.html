          <p>Intense rainfall in the Ruidoso area of southern New Mexico has resulted in severe flash flooding, causing a river to rise nearly 19 feet in minutes. The powerful waters were seen sweeping an entire house downstream, and authorities conducted at least 85 swift-water rescues to save people trapped in homes and vehicles. While there were no reported fatalities, three individuals were hospitalized and some remain unaccounted for. The region, previously affected by wildfires, is more susceptible to such events due to unstable soil in burn scars.</p>

          <p>Following misconduct allegations from over 50 more individuals, TV presenter Gregg Wallace has been cautioned by Baroness Helena Kennedy not to dismiss the claims. Wallace, who denies the allegations, was reportedly sacked from "MasterChef" after an independent inquiry into his behavior, which includes accusations of inappropriate sexual comments and touching. Baroness Kennedy, who chairs a creative industries watchdog, criticized TV industry managers for not addressing concerns about Wallace earlier. The new claims add to a previous investigation involving 13 accusers.</p>

          <p>G8 Education, one of Australia's largest childcare providers, will accelerate the installation of CCTV in its 400+ centers after an employee was charged with over 70 offenses, including the sexual assault of children. The company apologized for the pain caused and announced new policies, such as allowing parents to choose who can assist their children with toileting. The accused, Joshua Dale Brown, allegedly committed the offenses against eight children between 2022 and 2023. While the move is intended to enhance safety, some child protection experts caution that CCTV is not a complete solution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning to diplomats about attempts to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials using artificial intelligence. The alert followed the discovery that an impostor posing as Rubio tried to contact foreign ministers, a U.S. senator, and a governor via text, Signal, and voicemail. While officials described the hoaxes as "not very sophisticated" and unsuccessful, the incident highlights the growing threat of deepfake technology for deception and espionage. The FBI has previously warned about malicious actors using AI to impersonate senior government officials.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Donald Trump made significant gains with Latino voters, his administration's recent aggressive and widespread immigration raids risk reversing that progress. The author notes that instead of focusing on newly arrived migrants or those with criminal records, the operations have swept up long-term residents and instilled fear in communities. This approach is drawing parallels to California's Proposition 187 in the 1990s, which radicalized a generation of Latino voters against the Republican party. The piece suggests the perceived cruelty of the raids is undermining a key political achievement for Trump.</p>

According to LACA, a school food organization, the funding rate of £2.61 per meal is insufficient, with the actual cost being closer to £3.45. This financial pressure is making it increasingly difficult to meet official school food standards. While the government plans to expand free school meal eligibility, head teachers and caterers warn that without a significant funding increase, the quality of children's lunches will continue to decline.</p>

One documented case involves the arson of a London warehouse storing supplies for Ukraine, which British prosecutors linked to Russia's intelligence services.

          <p>At 80 years old, John Fogerty delivered an energetic and memorable rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The concert heavily featured the iconic songs of Creedence Clearwater Revival, the band he famously fronted. Fogerty, who recently regained full legal rights to his CCR compositions, performed with remarkable vocal consistency and guitar prowess. The show was a powerful exhibition of his classic catalog, including hits like "Bad Moon Rising" and "Fortunate Son," demonstrating the timeless appeal of his music to a large and appreciative audience.</p>

          <p>Four days after catastrophic flash floods struck Central Texas, Governor Greg Abbott confirmed that at least 161 people are still missing in Kerr County alone. The death toll from the disaster has risen to at least 109, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the Kerrville area. Search and rescue operations are continuing with extensive resources, including helicopters and drones, as authorities vow not to stop until everyone is accounted for.

          <p>In a show of unity against recent U.S. rhetoric, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their bilateral trade flows. The move comes after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on any country that is part of the BRICS economic bloc, which he claimed was set up to harm the U.S. and its currency. BRICS, a group of emerging economies that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, seeks to increase the influence of the Global South. This development highlights the growing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the developing world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delta flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale was forced to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers, Florida, after a passenger's portable battery caught fire. Flight attendants successfully extinguished the blaze, but the residual smoke in the cabin prompted the diversion. This incident highlights a growing safety concern, as the Federal Aviation Administration reports that lithium battery fires on U.S. flights have increased significantly, now occurring nearly twice a week. In response to this risk, some airlines are implementing stricter rules requiring portable chargers to be used in plain sight.</p>

The article contrasts the dismantling of U.S. aid institutions with China's proactive initiatives, such as the new International Organisation for Mediation based in Hong Kong. The author suggests that the center of gravity for global cooperation is shifting eastward. This provides an opportunity for Hong Kong, as China's most cosmopolitan city, to harness this momentum and increase its international prominence.</p>

Both events occurred along the Guadalupe River in an area known as "Flash Flood Alley," where geography causes water to rise with terrifying speed. A former camp counselor recalls the 1987 flood, noting that while informal warning systems existed, the ferocity of the current disaster seems to have been different and unexpected. The river's history includes at least five deadly floods in the last century, highlighting the area's persistent vulnerability to such tragedies.</p>
