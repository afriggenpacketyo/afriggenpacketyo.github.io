          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:41:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly escalating trade tensions by demanding a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on all imports from the European Union. This move comes after weeks of stalled negotiations, where the EU had hoped for a deal similar to the one with the U.K., which has a 10% baseline. The demand reflects President Trump's long-standing concerns over the significant trade surplus the EU holds in goods with the U.S. This development has caused market uncertainty, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling in response to the news.

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining crucial access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, defeating a challenge from Exxon Mobil. Exxon had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's stake in the lucrative Stabroek Block oil project. The resolution of this dispute removes significant uncertainty that had weighed on Chevron's stock, though the company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess into its operations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, the first major piece of stablecoin legislation, which now awaits the president's signature. This historic development has boosted market sentiment, causing the price of Ether and related stocks like Coinbase to climb significantly. The bill provides a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which experts believe will solidify their role in the global financial system. This legislative milestone, combined with strong ETF inflows, suggests a potential shift in momentum from Bitcoin to Ether within the cryptocurrency space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing files related to Jeffrey Epstein were instructed to specifically 'flag' any documents mentioning President Donald Trump. Durbin sent letters to the Department of Justice and the FBI seeking clarification on what he described as a haphazard review process involving personnel who lacked expertise in handling such sensitive information. This allegation adds to the mounting pressure on the Trump administration regarding the handling and promised release of records connected to the deceased sex offender, a former associate of the president.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood is legally challenging a provision in a new tax bill that would cut off Medicaid funding for its clinics nationwide. In a federal court hearing, attorneys for the organization argued that these cuts would harm vulnerable patients by targeting providers that primarily offer family planning services. The law, which affects organizations receiving over $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023 for such services, is seen by Planned Parenthood as a direct political attack. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the cuts, with a decision on a longer-term injunction expected soon.</p>

          <p>According to the latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, Americans' outlook on inflation has significantly improved, with expectations falling to their lowest levels since before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation forecast dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers remain wary of future price increases, they largely believe the inflationary effects of tariffs will be temporary. The data provides an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve, as well-anchored inflation expectations are a key factor in monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent violence in southern Syria highlights a fundamental policy disagreement between the United States and Israel regarding the country's future. The Trump administration has advocated for a strong, centralized Syrian government under its new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa. In contrast, Israel remains wary of Sharaa's jihadist past and has supported local minority groups like the Druze, seemingly preferring a weaker, more divided Syria. This divergence led to a crisis when Sharaa's forces moved into the Druze province of Sweida, sparking sectarian clashes and a retaliatory Israeli airstrike on Damascus, undermining diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss, restrictive diets, and cosmetic surgery are easily accessible to underage users on TikTok, violating the platform's own guidelines. Using an account registered for a 15-year-old, researchers found content promoting dangerously low-calorie diets and idealizing unhealthy body types, with some videos using hashtags associated with eating disorders. After interacting with a few such videos, the platform's algorithm began recommending similar harmful content. TikTok responded that the findings were based on a limited sample and that it works to provide support resources.</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have caused severe flooding in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, resulting in the deaths of at least 63 people in recent days. The country has experienced significantly more rainfall this month compared to the previous year, leading to flash floods and rising river levels. Authorities have issued warnings, advising against travel in affected areas and banning activities in or near bodies of water. With nearly 200 deaths reported nationwide since late June and more heavy rain forecasted, there are growing concerns of a repeat of the catastrophic 2022 floods.</p>

          <p>In a prehistoric tomb in the Pyrenees Mountains, archaeologists have discovered a 4,000-year-old human rib bone with a flint arrowhead embedded in it, suggesting a violent altercation among the region's earliest shepherds. The angle of the projectile indicates the individual was shot in the back. However, evidence of bone regeneration around the arrowhead suggests the wound was not immediately fatal, and the person may have survived for some time after the attack. This discovery provides a rare, grisly insight into interpersonal violence and conflict within ancient European communities during the third millennium BCE.</p>

          <p>A routine eye test for declining vision led to a life-changing series of diagnoses for Elizabeth Craig, a 55-year-old woman from Northamptonshire, UK. When an optician could find no issue within her eye to explain the vision loss, a referral for an MRI scan revealed a meningioma, a type of brain tumor, pressing on her optic nerve. During follow-up testing for the tumor, doctors discovered a suspicious nodule that was confirmed to be breast cancer. Her story highlights the critical importance of regular health screenings, as they can sometimes detect serious underlying conditions that are not yet symptomatic.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their controversial Glastonbury performance. The probe was launched after on-stage comments related to a band member's upcoming court case. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police concluded there was 'insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.' The band, known for their pro-Palestinian stance, condemned the investigation as 'political policing intimidation,' while an inquiry into another musical act from the festival continues.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing 'Schedule G,' a new classification for federal employees in policy-related roles, making them at-will political appointees. This move strips these employees of traditional civil service protections, meaning they can be more easily hired and fired and are expected to leave with changing administrations. The White House claims this will improve government operations and help dismantle the 'deep state.' Critics, however, argue it is a significant step toward politicizing the nonpartisan federal workforce, a key goal of conservative manifestos like Project 2025.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and adhere to a nighttime curfew over fears he might flee the country while on trial. Bolsonaro is accused of plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss, charges he denies. The restrictions, which also bar him from social media, follow raids on his home and come amid pressure from U.S. President Trump, who has threatened tariffs on Brazil in an attempt to influence the case. Bolsonaro called the court's decision a 'supreme humiliation.'</p>

          <p>In a late-night session, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $9 billion package of spending cuts demanded by President Trump, voting along party lines. The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, rescinds about $8 billion in foreign assistance and $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The vote faced a last-minute procedural delay due to political maneuvering over the Jeffrey Epstein case, as Democrats attempted to force votes on releasing documents related to the financier, highlighting growing tensions within the Republican party on the issue.</p>
