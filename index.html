            <h2>UK Lawmakers Advocate for Streaming Levy to Bolster Local TV Production</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 04:26:25 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A group of UK Members of Parliament is urging the government to impose a levy on streaming services' subscription revenues to support British high-end TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee suggests that streaming companies contribute 5% of their UK subscriber revenue to a cultural fund, aiming to finance dramas with specific interest to British audiences, and prevent the inward investment from crowding out independent British producers. Streaming services like Netflix worry that such levies could diminish competitiveness and penalize audiences. COBA also said that the levy risks impacting content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.</p>

            <p>President Trump has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, leading to strong reactions from China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the move as selfish and against global interests, and Trump cited a lack of respect from China in response to his tariff campaign. Beijing retaliated by increasing tariffs on all U.S. goods to 84%, vowing to safeguard its economy and international interests. Lin emphasized that trade wars have no winners, but China will defend itself, creating uncertainty for global trade and economic stability.</p>

            <p>Chinese economists suggest that the escalating US-China trade war is evolving into a test of long-term economic and industrial resilience. Zheng Yongnian from CUHK-Shenzhen argues that China and the US are competing for economic resilience and should focus on building robust industrial systems. This perspective emerges after both countries imposed unprecedented tariff levels, with the US at 125% on Chinese imports and China at 84% on US goods. Economists suggest that China will need to implement government stimulus to unleash domestic demand, which is crucial for navigating the turbulent times.</p>

            <p>A recent WHO report reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Health organizations warn that cuts to international aid by the US and UK will exacerbate the situation, potentially reversing progress made in reducing maternal deaths. These funding cuts are already impacting access to essential supplies, medicines, and healthcare staff, particularly in countries heavily reliant on US-funded programs. The report underscores the urgent need for increased investment and political commitment to improve maternal care and prevent further loss of life.</p>

These thieves target luxury vehicles and ship them to West Africa, where they become untraceable due to lax regulations and counterfeit documentation. Law enforcement agencies like Interpol are increasing efforts to combat this transnational crime, but challenges remain in tracking and preventing the flow of stolen vehicles.</p>

            <p>Despite a long-standing reputation for overworking his starters, data suggests that Tom Thibodeau's players are not necessarily more prone to injury than others in the NBA. Jeff Stotts of InStreetClothes, who maintains a detailed NBA injury database, found no clear pattern linking Thibodeau's coaching style to increased injury risk. While injury spikes occurred during his tenure with the Bulls, largely due to Derrick Rose's injury, the broader trend reveals a league-wide increase in injuries over the past decade, regardless of coaching style. The NBA is seeing more injuries across the board and it could be attributed to the amount of basketball played before entering the NBA and the changes in team routines.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's immigration chief, Bill Chung, is retiring early due to backlash over stricter regulations for spouses from mainland China. The National Immigration Agency (NIA) has faced criticism for enforcing a policy requiring mainland-born spouses to provide documentation proving they have renounced their mainland nationality. Failure to comply could result in the revocation of their Taiwan residence permits and household registration, forcing them to return to the mainland. The regulations, stemming from a 2004 revision to Taiwan's immigration law, have been deemed discriminatory by critics.</p>

Dalio believes Trump's temporary pause on tariffs is a step in the right direction, urging him to address trade imbalances through negotiation rather than sweeping tariffs. He proposes a deal that includes appreciating the RMB against the dollar and easing fiscal and monetary policies in China to stimulate demand. Dalio also recommends that the Trump administration cut the U.S. deficit to 3% of GDP to improve trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

Economists anticipate a divergence between consumer and producer prices, with core consumer prices showing signs of recovery, while producer prices are expected to deteriorate due to trade disruptions.
