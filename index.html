          <p>A recent report in Guangming Daily details a 37-character cliff inscription discovered in 2020 on the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, may have sent an expedition westward in 221 BC to find the "elixir of life." The inscription, carved in Qin dynasty script near Zhaling Lake, chronicles a state-sponsored mission towards the mythical Mount Kunlun. While some see this as a potential rewriting of history, leading scholars remain skeptical, questioning the authenticity of the claim and reigniting debates about the true location of Kunlun. This discovery has fueled accusations of potential forgery and sparked intense discussion among historians. The optimism score for this article is 50.</p>

          <p>China's recent restrictions on rare earth exports, implemented in response to U.S. tariffs, are impacting the automotive and robotics industries, and analysts warn that Western defense giants will also feel the pinch. These restrictions require firms to apply for licenses to export rare earths and magnets, which are crucial for advanced defense technologies. Rare earth elements enable advanced radar, sonar systems, laser guidance, and propulsion technologies. The U.S., EU, and Australia are urged to coordinate interventions to boost rare earth production due to prevailing price dynamics, with defense companies already expressing concerns behind closed doors.

          <p>According to insiders, Prince Harry remains focused on the past, causing friction with Meghan Markle, who is building a Hollywood empire. Royal experts suggest that Harry's dwelling on the past damages any chance of reconciliation with the royal family, who distrust Meghan and believe she catalyzed the rift. Meghan's focus on her business endeavors is seen as provocative and a barrier to rebuilding trust with the senior royals. Since stepping back as senior royals in 2020, the couple has aired grievances against the royal family, with Harry's memoir, "Spare," revealing private details and allegations.

          <p>UK companies are holding back on hiring or replacing departing workers, leading to a decline in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.6%. This trend is partly attributed to increased National Insurance contributions paid by employers and a rise in the minimum wage. While average wages have slowed to 5.2%, they remain above the rate of inflation. The optimism score for this article is 45.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to block the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit comes as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seeks court approval to buy the struggling firm. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without express, informed consent. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information, and it cannot be sold like ordinary property. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
