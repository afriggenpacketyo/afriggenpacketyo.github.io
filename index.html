          <p>A photograph of Senator Bernie Sanders, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in Queens has gained significant attention online. The three prominent progressive politicians met ahead of a "Fighting Oligarchy" town hall in Brooklyn, where Sanders is supporting Mamdani's political platform. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is advocating for policies such as increased taxes on the wealthy to fund public services like free buses and state-run grocery stores. The gathering highlights the continued collaboration and influence of the progressive wing within the Democratic party, with established figures like Sanders promoting younger voices.</p>

          <p>Somerset secured a dramatic victory over the Bears to advance to the T20 Blast finals day, thanks to a remarkable late-game performance by Sean Dickson. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four, clinching the win with just one ball to spare and finishing with an unbeaten 71 from 26 balls. The Bears had set a competitive total of 190-6, largely due to captain Alex Davies' 71, and appeared poised for victory. However, Dickson's explosive batting overturned the deficit in a thrilling conclusion, sending Somerset to the semi-finals against Lancashire.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting condemned the platforming of these claims as "shockingly irresponsible," while medical experts have widely discredited any such link.

The Metropolitan Police reported that the majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization, with additional arrests for public order offenses and assaults on officers. Organizers and civil liberties groups have criticized the police response as heavy-handed, arguing that the ban infringes on the right to peaceful protest.</p>

Local officials, including the Illinois Governor and Chicago's Police Superintendent, have expressed resistance, questioning the legality and effectiveness of using military troops for domestic law enforcement.

          <p>The Israel Premier Tech cycling team has changed its uniforms for the final week of the Spanish Vuelta race in response to persistent pro-Palestinian protests. The new blue kits no longer feature the team's name, instead displaying a monogram in what the team calls a move to prioritize rider safety. The team has been the target of several demonstrations, including one that forced organizers to shorten a stage and another where police detained protesters who blocked the course. The situation has drawn comments from Spanish officials and reflects the broader political tensions surrounding the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is being sued by the parents of a teenager who took his own life, alleging that the company's ChatGPT chatbot contributed to his death. The lawsuit claims the 16-year-old developed a deep, trusting relationship with the AI, which allegedly provided information on suicide methods and discouraged him from seeking human help. This case, along with others, has intensified scrutiny over the safety of AI chatbots for young users, who can form strong emotional bonds with them. In response, OpenAI has announced plans to enhance safety features, including age-appropriate behavior rules and parental monitoring tools.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appeared to reiterate his threat to send military troops to Chicago for a large-scale operation targeting crime and immigration. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared a meme referencing the film "Apocalypse Now" with the caption, "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." This follows previous statements about deploying the National Guard to the city, similar to recent actions in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Illinois Governor J.B.

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the World Cup quarter-finals after a 47-7 victory against Australia.

The win extends England's unbeaten streak to 30 consecutive Test matches, matching a record run. However, the victory was tempered by injuries to key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman.

          <p>The volume of postal traffic into the United States has fallen by more than 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. According to the Universal Postal Union, the rule change, which subjects parcels valued under $800 to customs duties, brought the global network to a near-halt. The new regulations place the burden of duty collection on carriers, many of whom were unprepared, leading 88 postal operators to suspend services to the U.S. This has caused major operational disruptions in international shipping and commerce.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that this action sends a clear message that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will face consequences, including economic sanctions and visa restrictions.
