          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, released its first earnings report since its IPO, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company reported a loss of $1.49 per share but generated $981.6 million in revenue, exceeding the expected $853 million. Management anticipates revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, driven by new client uptake and a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite long-term uncertainties in AI supply and demand, CoreWeave is working to diversify its business and sees no meaningful impact from President Trump's tariffs.</p>

The athlete, Marissa Rothenberger, a biological male who identifies as female, has excelled in the sport, leading to questions about the impact of size and strength differences. The father emphasizes the need for transparency and a clear policy rooted in biology to protect female athletes, especially given the potential for serious injury in softball.

Critics argue the analysis misrepresents data and is part of a broader effort to limit abortion access. The FDA commissioner has stated he is open to reviewing new safety data on the pills.</p>

          <p>Kseniia Petrova, a Harvard researcher, faces deportation to Russia despite her fears of arrest due to her history of political protest. The Trump administration has announced criminal smuggling charges against her for failing to declare scientific samples she was carrying. A government lawyer stated the intention to deport her, leading to conflict with a federal judge in Vermont who scheduled a bail hearing. Petrova's lawyer argues the charges are intended to justify her deportation and that she was detained unlawfully.</p>

          <p>Even with reduced tariffs, broad-based tariffs on Chinese imports remain too costly for soybeans and other US sectors, the head of a soybean industry group told US senators. While Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs, US soybeans exported to China still face levies of 34 per cent, reflecting Beijing’s retaliatory duties, the most favoured nation rate, and China’s value added tax. The US sells more soybeans to China, by value, than any other single product, even after President Donald Trump launched his first trade war against the country in 2018, which drastically reduced US soybean exports.</p>
