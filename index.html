            <p>The Trump administration has paused the implementation of new safety measures designed to protect coal miners from hazardous dust exposure. This decision has sparked criticism from safety advocates who argue that the delay could endanger miners' long-term health. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) cited workforce reductions at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a reason for the delay. Experts worry that this move, coupled with the administration's push to revive the coal industry, places miners at undue risk of developing debilitating respiratory conditions like black lung.</p>

            <p>The House of Representatives adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after overcoming resistance from conservative Republicans seeking deeper spending cuts. The resolution passed with a narrow margin, as Republican leaders secured assurances that the Senate would pursue significant savings. The budget plan is a crucial step in the reconciliation process, enabling Congress to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold and advance Trump's priorities with a simple majority. Democrats have criticized the proposed cuts, warning they will disproportionately impact entitlement programs.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to pause his administration's "reciprocal tariffs" was influenced by a negative reaction from the bond market. As the tariffs went into effect, bond prices declined and yields on 2-year Treasury notes rose significantly, signaling investor concern. Economists had warned that the tariffs raised the risks of a recession and could reignite inflation. The turmoil in the bond market put pressure on the nation's finances, as rising yields increase the cost of servicing the national debt.</p>

            <p>President Trump's increased tariffs on imports from China would essentially halt most trade between the two countries, according to economist Erica York. With the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese goods now standing at 145%, the market is still uncertain, with no clarity expected until July. While Trump temporarily reduced tariffs on most countries to 10%, the overall protectionist stance is at its highest level since the 1940s. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is seeking a rate increase that includes raising the price of a "forever" stamp from 73 cents to 78 cents. The proposed changes, which require approval from the Postal Regulatory Commission, would also increase prices for postcards, metered letters, and international mail. The USPS contends that the increase is necessary to achieve financial stability. The increase follows the resignation of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and discussions about privatizing the mail service.</p>

            <p>President Trump has vowed to halt the U.S. offshore wind industry, posing a threat to cities like New London, Connecticut, that have invested heavily in it. Trump's administration has paused federal permitting for new offshore wind projects and initiated a review of the industry's environmental and economic impacts. This has created uncertainty and challenges for the industry, potentially jeopardizing jobs and investments. The Northeast region is counting on offshore wind to meet electricity demands, drive economic growth, and achieve climate goals.</p>
