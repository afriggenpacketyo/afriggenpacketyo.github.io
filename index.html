          <p>President Trump is scheduled to speak with Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the conflict in Ukraine, following up on recent peace talks in Istanbul. Trump aims to address the 'bloodbath' and trade issues, planning subsequent talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and NATO members. Despite ongoing contacts and prisoner exchange agreements, significant differences remain between Moscow and Kyiv regarding ceasefire terms and war goals. Long-range strikes continue as both sides remain entrenched in their positions, with Ukraine focused on an immediate ceasefire and Russia focused on eliminating the causes that triggered this crisis.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a significant agreement covering fishing rights, defense cooperation, and trade, marking a reset in relations five years after Brexit. The deal aims to improve trade for food imports and exports, allowing European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038, while also focusing on security and defense, and a youth mobility plan. The agreement comes amid a changing global landscape, with the return of President Trump creating a greater sense of urgency for cooperation between the U.K. and the bloc, though the deal faces criticism from Brexit supporters who view it as a surrender of sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicates he is leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year due to concerns about rising inflation, particularly related to the impact of tariffs. Despite the Federal Reserve's earlier projections of two rate cuts in 2025, Bostic worries about consumer sentiment and expectations moving in a troublesome way, potentially complicating the Fed's job. He emphasized that even reduced tariffs are economically significant, suggesting a cautious approach to monetary policy in the face of potential upward pressures on prices.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the "NVLink Fusion" program, allowing customers to use non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's NVLink technology. This move expands NVLink beyond Nvidia-made chips, enabling semi-custom AI infrastructure by combining Nvidia processors with different CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). AI chipmaking partners for NVLink Fusion include MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence. This initiative positions Nvidia to capture a share of data centers based on ASICs, traditionally seen as competitors, and maintain its central role in artificial intelligence development and computing.</p>

While no specific target was mentioned, the move signals the government’s support for home-made EVs, though its overall impact on the industry may be limited. This directive builds on previous guidelines from 2017 and a recent mandate that EVs must account for at least 30% of total annual vehicle purchases by ministry-level authorities, reflecting ongoing efforts to cut costs and support domestic industries.</p>

          <p>A look into the history of male friendship reveals how cultural narratives and societal expectations have shaped emotional bonds over time. In the Renaissance era, passionate bonds between men were celebrated, with figures like Sir John Finch and Sir Thomas Baines memorializing their intimate connection. However, views shifted in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to the idealization of female friendships and the portrayal of male bonds as less emotionally deep. Understanding these historical shifts can help reimagine contemporary expectations and foster more diverse and meaningful connections.</p>

The snap election was called after Portugal’s Parliament ousted the year-old center-right government in a vote of no confidence.

          <h2>Keir Starmer's Post-Brexit Strategy Relies on Public Apathy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keir Starmer is betting that the British public is largely indifferent to Brexit-related issues and seeks only pragmatic solutions to minimize friction with the EU. He is trying to make the UK's relationship with the EU smoother, but within the parameters of Brexit. While the Conservatives and Reform UK criticize the deal as a surrender, the Liberal Democrats call for more ambition. The success of Starmer's strategy hinges on whether the public truly wants to move beyond the Brexit debate or if opposition parties can reignite controversy over the UK's relationship with the EU.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government is introducing new regulations to oversee the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, aiming to protect shoppers from debt traps. BNPL firms will be required to conduct upfront checks to ensure consumers can repay what they borrow and facilitate easier access to refunds. Consumers will also have the ability to file BNPL complaints with the Financial Ombudsman. The new rules seek to bring stability to the rapidly growing BNPL market and ensure responsible lending practices.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article discusses the pressures on Salman Rushdie to cancel an appearance because of his comments about college campuses. The author writes that free speech is easy to condone when it involves issues of at least broad general agreement, but that it is supposed to break through this kind of categorical thinking and ensure openness. The author also writes that there are a variety of factors making it difficult to talk about what is happening in Israel and Palestine, with the result being a culture in which people believe that they have no good reason to express themselves outside a narrow range of topics.</p>

The move reflects Beijing’s growing anxiety over mounting debts and aims to prevent wasteful spending at various levels of government, which has contributed to snowballing debt.</p>

          <p>Despite the narrative that pollsters corrected their errors in 2024, the Atlantic reports that polling was still inaccurate, with the same margin of error as in 2016. The article suggests that there's an ongoing issue of nonresponse bias, with those who take surveys being different from those who don’t. The article also suggests that low-trust voters who don’t answer polls don’t suddenly transform into reliable respondents once the election’s over. The author concludes by saying that they are skeptical that the polling industry will ever be accurate.</p>
