          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition force in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. This achievement mirrors the broader surge of far-right movements across Europe, including France's National Rally and the Brothers of Italy. Chega's rise is attributed to its strong stance against immigration and the inability of traditional parties to form stable governments. With 60 seats in the National Assembly, Chega leader Andre Ventura hailed this as a profound change in the Portuguese political system, challenging the dominance of center-right and center-left parties. The party campaigned under the slogan "Save Portugal," reflecting its nationalist agenda.</p>

          <p>Nearly ten months after a Texas family's boat capsized off the coast of Homer, Alaska, human remains have been recovered from the sunken vessel, bringing a measure of closure to the tragic event. David and Mary Maynard, along with their two sons, went missing in August 2024 after their boat capsized. Private companies assisted Alaska State Troopers in locating the boat in 180 feet of water, identifying potential human remains onboard. Divers have since recovered three sets of remains, which have been transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for identification and autopsy. The family is remembered for the laughter and love they brought to others.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs. The court stated that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce, not the president. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, but the ruling caused stock markets to rise in Asia and the U.S. dollar to gain against safe-haven currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

It questions the motivations of young Americans who travel to a foreign country to join an army involved in what the article describes as apartheid. The author contrasts this with Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians against Russian occupation, noting the disparity in numbers and the moral implications. The piece also highlights the lack of scrutiny given to the radicalization of young Zionist men and women compared to the experiences of Muslims. It concludes by suggesting that parents should discourage their children from participating in atrocities.</p>

While South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. reached $55.6 billion in 2024, KITA argues that this surplus is not due to unfair trade practices but rather to substitutions of Chinese products and structural changes in U.S. imports.

While Toyota has stated it will not pass on tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term.

The Hass Avocado Board, funded by assessments on both domestic and imported avocados, has played a key role in marketing and nutritional research.

          <p>The British government is considering sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to rising concerns over the suffering of civilians in Gaza. The government is mulling the sanctions for months, but has not decided whether to proceed. The government may wait to see if Israel allows a measurable increase in aid to Gaza. British officials are similarly ambivalent about when to recognize an independent Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A video clip of a laughing Joshlin Smith, a South African girl who went missing over a year ago, caused tears in the courtroom during a hearing for her mother's sentencing. Racquel Smith, a drug addict, was convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her daughter, believed to have been sold for money. Witnesses alleged she sold Joshlin to a traditional healer for her eyes and skin. Joshlin's teacher described her as a quiet and tidy pupil, and the class listens to her favorite gospel song daily in her memory. Her disappearance has caused shockwaves across the country.</p>

          <p>Racial segregation in schools continues to exist in Slovakia, where over 60% of Roma children attend schools where they are in the majority. In nearly a quarter of primary schools, Roma children are separated into "Roma schools" or "Roma classes," often with lower academic expectations and higher dropout rates. Despite legal guarantees and pressure from human rights bodies, segregation persists. The Slovak government, after initially denying discriminatory treatment, acknowledged the existence of segregation in 2020 and introduced reforms, but these measures often reinforce segregation rather than eliminate it. The EU's target of reducing segregation by only 50% by 2030 undermines the illegality of segregation.</p>

This pattern extends to other institutions and individuals, with Trump framing his actions as reactions to their behavior.

Chinese airlines remain reluctant to import Boeing aircraft due to the cost of remaining duties, potentially leading to delivery delays and order cancellations.

It is part of a proliferating array of lawsuits over Mr. Trump’s use of the law, the Alien Enemies Act, to deport people accused of being members of that gang, Tren de Aragua, to a notorious Salvadoran prison without due process. The legal troubles of the detainees, the council said, could “motivate them to make false allegations about their ties to the Venezuelan regime in an effort to deflect responsibility for their crimes and to lessen any punishment by providing exculpatory or otherwise ‘valuable’ information to U.S. prosecutors.”</p>
