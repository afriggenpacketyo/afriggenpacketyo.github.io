          <p>According to a new study by Waymo, autonomous vehicles could drastically reduce traffic fatalities due to their ability to avoid human errors like distracted or impaired driving. The study compared the safety performance of Waymo's self-driving cars over 56.7 million miles to human driving, revealing significant reductions in airbag-deploying crashes, injury crashes, and pedestrian injuries. Extrapolating this data across all vehicle miles driven in the US suggests that widespread adoption of self-driving cars could save approximately 34,000 lives per year, although some caveats apply, such as the study's focus on warm, sunny locations. While public opinion has been turning against self-driving cars, the article argues that slowing down their development is costing lives.</p>

          <p>Following heavy losses in English local elections, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch cautioned against expecting a simple leadership change to solve the party's deep-seated problems. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg program, Badenoch acknowledged Reform UK's gains and emphasized the need for a credible plan to fix the country's issues rather than rushing out unsustainable promises to win votes. She also addressed the possibility of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage becoming Prime Minister, stating it was her job to ensure he does not as she does not believe he has the answers to the problems the country is facing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Guardian suggests that President Trump's policies are creating significant economic uncertainty in the United States, leading to anxiety among consumers and businesses. The uncertainty stems from unpredictable tariff policies, budget cuts, and immigration policies, making it difficult for businesses to plan and consumers to make spending decisions. The article notes that while hard economic data is currently stable, forward-looking surveys indicate growing anxiety, and that the lack of clarity on future policies is driving much of the economic impact. The author suggests that a more settled policy position could alleviate some of the uncertainty, but Trump's preference for political drama makes this unlikely.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is exploring legal options, including judicial reviews and injunctions, to prevent asylum seekers from being housed in areas where the party now controls the local council. Party chairman Zia Yusuf stated that Reform intends to "resist" housing asylum seekers and will use all available instruments of power to fulfill this pledge, focusing on planning regulations and budget allocation. Yusuf also mentioned the party's plan to deport all illegal immigrants during their first term in government and criticized spending on diversity and inclusion initiatives. The Home Office is responsible for housing adult asylum seekers and councils have little power to stop it.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift in his administration towards prioritizing loyalty and MAGA ideology over moderation. The article suggests that unlike Trump's first term, which involved navigating competing interests within the Republican Party, business community, and administrative state, his second term is characterized by a "royal court" of courtiers who prioritize maintaining his favor above all else. This shift, the article claims, removes the guardrails that tempered Trump's most extreme impulses in his first term, leading to a more uninhibited and potentially reckless presidency.</p>

          <h2>LA Victims of Sexual Assault Say $4 Billion Settlement 'Cannot Undo Decades of Mistreatment'</h2>

          <p>Thousands of victims of sexual assault in Los Angeles County juvenile facilities and foster homes are receiving compensation in a historic $4 billion settlement. However, some victims argue that the money cannot rectify the systemic failures that allowed the abuse to occur and protected the abusers. The claims largely center around the MacLaren Children's Center, which closed in 2003 amid concerns about abuse. While officials have proposed reforms, some victims argue that closure will not come until those responsible for the abuse are held accountable.</p>

          <p>The US Federal Reserve's Jerome Powell may resist pressure from President Trump to cut interest rates, according to an article in the South China Morning Post. Despite growing fears of an economic slowdown, the Fed is inclined to hold rates steady due to concerns about inflation. Strong April payroll data is expected to support the Fed's decision to prioritize price stability, although higher US duties on imports risk undermining progress on inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is challenging the traditional two-party system in Britain following gains in recent local elections. The article suggests that Reform's success, along with gains by other smaller parties, reflects a broader fragmentation of British society and a growing disenchantment with the Labour and Conservative parties. While the next general election is not until 2029, the article argues that Reform's rising support could transform British politics and potentially replace the Conservatives as the main opposition party.</p>

          <p>The Sudanese army reports that a drone attack launched by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) struck a military airport in Port Sudan. This marks the first time RSF attacks have reached the city, which serves as the de-facto capital of Sudan's military-led government, since the conflict began two years ago. While no injuries were reported, the attack caused limited damage and has led to the closure of the airport and the suspension of all flights.</p>
