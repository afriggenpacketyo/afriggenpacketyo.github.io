        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed a deal for joint exploitation of Ukraine's energy and mineral resources, establishing a reconstruction investment fund to bolster Ukraine's economic recovery amid its ongoing conflict with Russia. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted the commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine, while Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko emphasized attracting global investment. The agreement, seen as crucial for accessing US military aid, grants Washington access to some of Ukraine's natural resources in exchange for future security assistance, though less than initially sought by President Trump. The article notes the deal was delayed due to concerns over governance, transparency, and fund traceability, with technical documents signed last week.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, the maker of "Fortnite," accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct and pricing. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple impeded developers' ability to communicate with users and levied commissions on off-app purchases in defiance of a 2021 order. The judge has ordered Apple to cease these practices and has referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for potential criminal contempt proceedings. Apple has stated it strongly disagrees with the decision and will appeal.</p>

          <p>Families of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea decades ago are appealing to the Trump administration for assistance in bringing their loved ones home.

          <p>A judge has accused Apple of willfully violating a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games case, stating that Apple's Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, "outright lied" to the court. The judge has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys to investigate potential criminal contempt proceedings against both Roman and Apple. The ruling is a significant rebuke of Apple's conduct in the Epic Games trial, with the judge ordering Apple to cease imposing commissions on purchases made for iPhone apps through web links inside an app. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the decision as a victory for developers.</p>

          <p>Japan's role in supporting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is becoming increasingly vital amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's recent visits to Vietnam and the Philippines aimed to position Japan as a reliable partner, especially with U.S. tariffs causing concern among ASEAN members. Experts highlight Japan's stable cooperation with the region and its "official security assistance" program as beneficial for promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific. Japan's role could serve as an intermediary between ASEAN and the United States, given shared values and long-standing cooperative ties.</p>
