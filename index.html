          <p>An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in Franklin Park, Illinois, after he allegedly resisted arrest and attempted to drive his vehicle into officers. According to DHS, one agent was struck and dragged by the suspect's car, sustaining severe injuries before firing his weapon. The incident, part of a broader immigration enforcement operation, has drawn scrutiny, with the suspect's girlfriend disputing the official account and Illinois' governor calling for a full investigation. The FBI is assisting local law enforcement in reviewing the circumstances of the fatal encounter.</p>

          <p>A high school teacher in Naples, New York, has been placed on administrative leave after posting celebratory and mocking messages on Facebook following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The teacher, Patrick Freivald, wrote "Good riddance to bad garbage" and described the killing in graphic detail, prompting outrage from the community and a formal investigation by the school district. Freivald has a history of controversial posts, previously lashing out at critics and boasting about his union protections. The superintendent condemned the posts and assured parents their concerns were heard.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, under the Trump administration, has announced plans to terminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has required over 8,000 industrial facilities to report their emissions since 2009. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the move would reduce regulatory burdens and save businesses billions, arguing the program has no material impact on health or the environment. However, environmental and health experts strongly oppose the proposal, warning that it would blind the public and policymakers to crucial pollution data needed to address climate change and protect public health. The plan is now open for a public comment period.</p>

          <p>A new report from House Republicans has identified approximately 50 US-China joint educational programs as "high-risk" and is demanding their termination. The report, led by the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues these partnerships pose a threat to national security by potentially advancing Beijing's military and technological capabilities. Programs at prominent institutions like New York University and Johns Hopkins were named due to alleged links to China's defense sector. This move represents a significant escalation in the campaign to sever academic ties between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The new mockumentary sequel, “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” revisits the iconic fictional band four decades after the original film but struggles to achieve the same comedic brilliance. The article suggests that while seeing the original cast reunite provides some nostalgic enjoyment, the concept of the band now being revered by real-life music legends like Paul McCartney undermines the satirical tension. The review notes that many of the jokes feel like rehashes of classic gags, such as the infamous drummer problem, and the overall film comes across as a feature-length outtake rather than a fresh comedic statement.</p>

Authored by Senator Scott Wiener, the bill aims to unlock hundreds of thousands of new homes in existing communities to improve affordability and access to services.

          <p>Austin Maddox, a former pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, has been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to charges related to soliciting a minor for sex. The charges, which included meeting a minor for unlawful acts, stemmed from an undercover sting operation in Florida in April 2024 where Maddox was one of 27 people arrested. As part of a plea deal, another charge was dismissed, and upon release, he will serve five years of sex offender probation.

During a press conference announcing an arrest, Cox framed the killing as an attack on American ideals and urged young people to reject a political culture of rage. This article from The Atlantic contrasts Cox's appeals for unity and de-escalation with Trump's calls to "beat the hell out of" political opponents and blame the left. While Cox represents a more traditional Republican response to tragedy, the article notes that Trump's more combative approach remains dominant within the party.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the immediate rush by many on the political right to label the assassinated activist Charlie Kirk a "martyr" for his cause. The author argues that Kirk's confrontational style, rejection of empathy, and promotion of a political-religious ideology that sees white, Christian males as central to America's future are key reasons for this designation. The piece contrasts this view with the confusion and sadness expressed by college students, who mourn the tragic violence but are hesitant to apply the martyr label. It questions whether Kirk's legacy aligns with traditional Christian values, suggesting his martyrdom is tied more to a political struggle.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's lawyers have refuted claims that the pop star agreed to be deposed in the ongoing legal dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Baldoni's legal team had requested a deadline extension to accommodate a deposition with Swift, but her attorney stated she has "no material role" in the case and would only testify if compelled by the court. The conflict stems from dueling lawsuits between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars over allegations of sexual harassment and defamation. Lively's lawyers accused Baldoni's team of trying to involve Swift to create a "media spectacle" and disrespect her privacy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services plans to award a no-bid contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to research a potential link between vaccines and autism. The move comes after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine movement, announced a major research effort into the causes of autism. Critics and scientists have questioned the decision, noting that decades of extensive research have found no credible association between vaccination and autism. They argue that funding such a study diverts resources from more pressing research questions and lends legitimacy to a scientifically debunked theory.</p>

          <p>A major cyberattack has forced Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to shut down its global production lines for nearly two weeks, a crisis that now threatens its extensive network of suppliers. The production stoppage has already cost JLR an estimated £50 million, but smaller and medium-sized suppliers who depend on the carmaker are facing a more severe cashflow crunch. Experts warn that some of these firms could face bankruptcy, leading to significant job losses in the automotive supply chain. The UK government is now facing calls from unions and politicians to establish a furlough scheme to protect workers' jobs.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on data software company Palantir, stating he is "so inspired" by its high market valuation while also taking a jab at its pricing. In a recent interview, Benioff noted Palantir's stock trades at a very high multiple of its revenue and called its software the "most expensive" he has ever seen, suggesting Salesforce offers a more cost-effective alternative. The comments highlight the growing competition between the two companies, particularly for government contracts. Palantir's market capitalization has surpassed Salesforce's, despite Salesforce having significantly higher revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed an agent on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance after he made negative comments on Facebook about the recently assassinated Charlie Kirk. The agent, Anthony Pough, wrote that Kirk had "spewed hate and racism" and suggested his death was a result of "karma." In an internal memo, Secret Service Director Sean Curran reminded staff of their duty to remain politically unbiased and warned that such actions compromise the trust essential to their mission.

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled its plans to develop a fully electric version of its Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing slowing consumer demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in North America. The project had already faced multiple delays from its original 2024 launch target. Instead of a full BEV, Ram will focus on releasing an extended-range electric truck, now named the Ram 1500 REV, which will feature a gasoline engine as an onboard generator. This strategic shift is part of a broader reassessment of product strategy under new leadership at Stellantis, which aims to re-establish profitable growth.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of migrants and raised further doubts about the facility's capacity to hold large populations. A disruption to an underwater pipeline cut off water to the Migrant Operations Center, requiring the transfer of migrants to a different part of the base. The incident highlights the infrastructure challenges at Guantánamo, which critics argue is ill-equipped and excessively expensive for detaining the 30,000 migrants President Trump aims to send there. The government has stated that water is not expected to be restored for at least another week.</p>

Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi is offering wagers on sports outcomes under the guise of regulated predictions markets. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Kalshi from offering these contracts in the state. Kalshi has previously argued that its federal regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) preempts state-level gambling laws, a position that is now being directly challenged by Massachusetts in court.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic highlights the widespread and unified condemnation of Charlie Kirk's assassination from leading Democratic figures, from California Governor Gavin Newsom to progressive politicians. It contrasts this with a narrative pushed by some on the right who have sought to portray "the left" as celebrating the attack by amplifying offensive posts from a handful of anonymous individuals. The author argues that the Democratic Party has a healthy culture of marginalizing violent sentiments. The piece also criticizes President Trump's response for defining political violence as an exclusively left-wing problem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Vox article analyzes the significant influence of the late Charlie Kirk, arguing he was a generational figure who redefined conservative politics for Gen Z. Kirk's appeal stemmed from his ability to make conservatism culturally "cool" through his organization, Turning Point USA, which hosted large, festival-style events that blended politics with social identity. He masterfully used social media and a confrontational debate style that resonated with a generation skeptical of established institutions. The article suggests Kirk's legacy will be his success in tapping into an oppositional youth culture and building a powerful conservative media universe.</p>
