          <p>In Florida, a man, identified as Timothy Schulz, was fatally shot by sheriff's deputies after an apparent alligator attack. Deputies initially tried to use a Taser on Schulz, who was reportedly on drugs and wielding garden shears. The situation escalated when Schulz entered the deputies' patrol vehicle and attempted to access their weapons, leading the deputies to open fire. The incident is under investigation, and the deputies have been placed on administrative leave.</p>
