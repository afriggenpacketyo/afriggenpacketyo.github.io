          <p>Several UK newspapers report on the arrival of 1,097 migrants by boat, a figure described as "utterly unacceptable" by the new Home Secretary.  The Daily Mail suggests quitting the European Court of Human Rights as a solution, while other papers discuss the implications of the Labour cabinet reshuffle, including the departure of Angela Rayner and concerns about Sir Keir Starmer's leadership.  The papers also cover England's cricket victory over South Africa.  The article offers a snapshot of current political and social concerns in the UK.</p>
