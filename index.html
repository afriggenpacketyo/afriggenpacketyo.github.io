          <p>The House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and several past attorneys general and FBI directors for depositions regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Led by Republican Rep. James Comer, the committee is investigating the federal government's handling of the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The move follows a recent DOJ memo concluding Epstein had no "client list" and aims to inform potential legislative reforms on sex-crime investigations and non-prosecution agreements.</p>

          <p>Recovery efforts are ongoing across Scotland after Storm Floris, described as the "most damaging summer storm in recent memory," left thousands of homes without electricity. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) has restored power to 50,000 homes but 22,000 still face outages, primarily due to tree-related damage. The storm caused widespread disruption with gusts up to 90mph, leading to canceled trains, flights, and events like the Edinburgh Fringe. Officials expect most power to be restored soon, but some localized outages could extend for several days.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Donald Trump claimed that major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America had rejected him as a customer, forcing him to use smaller banks. He alleged this was part of a broader pattern of "de-banking" conservative clients, an issue his administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to address. JPMorgan responded by denying accounts are closed for political reasons but agreed that regulatory changes are needed. The claims highlight ongoing tensions between some political figures and the banking industry over account access. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chemical companies Chemours, DuPont, and Corteva have agreed to a settlement with the state of New Jersey, committing to pay $875 million over 25 years. The agreement resolves claims related to environmental pollution, particularly from PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to various health issues including cancer. This settlement follows over $11 billion in similar agreements in 2023, as federal regulations and public awareness of PFAS contamination continue to drive litigation. The payments will address damages from the companies' historical operations and other contamination sites across the state.</p>

          <p>A driver attempting to set a land speed record at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats died after losing control of his vehicle at 283 mph. The driver, identified as 60-year-old Chris Raschke, was operating a streamliner vehicle called the Speed Demon during the annual Speed Week event.

          <p>An analysis of the restaurant industry reveals that Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has developed a reputation as an incubator for top executive talent. Numerous leaders at rival chains, including the CEOs of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel, previously held senior roles within the Yum system. The company's focus on leadership development, massive global scale, and competitive internal environment are cited as key factors. This trend, which traces back to its origins as part of PepsiCo, has made Yum a go-to source for boards seeking proven industry leaders.</p>

          <p>Software analytics company Palantir saw its stock jump over 8% after reporting a "truly anomalous quarter" with revenue surpassing $1 billion for the first time. CEO Alex Karp attributed the blowout results to high demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and government contracts focused on efficiency. The company significantly raised its full-year revenue forecast, reflecting strong growth in its U.S. commercial and government sectors. Despite the strong performance, some analysts remain cautious, citing the company's high valuation relative to its earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oprah Winfrey has announced her latest book club selection is "Bridge of Sighs," a 2007 novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo. Winfrey appeared on "CBS Mornings" with Russo to discuss the book, which explores the lives of characters in a small, fictional town in upstate New York over several decades. The story centers on Louis Charles Lynch, known as Lucy, and his lifelong relationships and the secrets that define his community.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations, primarily due to struggling sales in the United States for its Pizza Hut and KFC chains. Both brands saw a 5% decline in U.S. same-store sales, which executives attributed to an "insufficient value message" in a challenging consumer environment. In contrast, the company's Taco Bell brand continued to perform well, posting a 4% same-store sales growth. Despite the U.S. weakness, Yum's overall global same-store sales grew 2%, lifted by strong international performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on disclosing personal information about crime suspects "needs to change," advocating for more transparency. Her comments follow public debate over the decision not to release the immigration status of two men, reportedly from Afghanistan, charged in the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old. While police forces currently follow national guidance that limits such disclosures to protect fair trials, there is growing pressure to release more details to counter misinformation and maintain public trust, a sentiment echoed by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests that while both major parties are engaging in aggressive gerrymandering, Republicans are better positioned to win the overall redistricting battle. The article uses the current standoff in Texas as a prime example of the cynical nature of the process. It argues that while Democrats in states like New York and California can draw maps to their advantage, they face more legal and political hurdles than Republicans in states they control. This imbalance could ultimately give the GOP a structural advantage in the U.S. House of Representatives for the coming decade.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant bid for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, with the total offer potentially reaching €85 million (£73.8m). The English club believes this is a fair valuation for the Slovenian forward and is confident the player is interested in a move to Old Trafford. Newcastle United is also in contention, having made a competing bid for Sesko. Manchester United's offer is seen as a serious step to secure the player, and the club may be willing to part with current striker Rasmus Hojlund to accommodate the new signing.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced photographs have ignited debate among military analysts about a potential new sixth-generation stealth aircraft from China. The images show a plane with a slim, tailless design, suggesting it could be a third distinct stealth fighter program, possibly designed for high speed. Some analysts speculate it may be an uncrewed drone optimized for stealth rather than a piloted fighter, given its streamlined appearance. The aircraft's lambda-wing layout has also led to suggestions that it could be a design for a collaborative combat aircraft intended to fly alongside piloted jets.</p>

The research found that interpreters, translators, writers, and various customer service roles are among the most "AI-unsafe" professions, with up to 98% of their work activities overlapping with tasks AI can perform. The study analyzed conversations with Microsoft's Bing Copilot to determine which work activities users most commonly seek AI assistance for.

This development revisits a highly contentious chapter in U.S. politics and is likely to intensify concerns that the Justice Department is being used for political purposes, given President Trump's long-standing grievances with the probe.</p>
