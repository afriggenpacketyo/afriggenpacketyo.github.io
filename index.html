          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased, marking an all-time high for April. The company expects a significant drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen. Other Japanese automakers experienced mixed results, with Honda benefiting from U.S. demand but facing sales declines in China and Japan, while Nissan's global sales fell due to restructuring efforts. This is strictly about governmental financial regulation, finance, or the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court has halted most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign nations, ruling that the levies exceed his legal authority. The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the 10% tariffs imposed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The court rejected the administration's justification under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, stating that Congress must authorize such tariffs. The Trump administration plans to appeal the ruling, while global markets rallied on the news. This is strictly about governmental financial regulation, finance, or the economy.

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District has scrapped its controversial "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community. The proposal, which would have based grades primarily on final exams and de-emphasized homework, attendance, and traditional grading scales, faced criticism from the mayor, lawmakers, and parents. Critics argued that the changes would lower standards and fail to adequately prepare students for success. The superintendent stated that no changes to grading practices have been implemented and that the district remains committed to high standards and student success.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing, a strategy that could intensify trade tensions with the U.S. Despite criticisms from the Trump administration regarding trade imbalances and state subsidies, China aims to achieve self-reliance in high-tech sectors. The "Made in China 2025" plan seeks to transform the country into a leading high-end manufacturer, but it has faced challenges and contributed to trade friction. Experts anticipate continued U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods as China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy.</p>

Starmer argues that Reform's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown and increase mortgage costs. Reform UK has gained momentum in recent local elections, challenging Britain's main parties. Reform defends its policies by proposing to fund them through measures like scrapping net-zero climate initiatives and cutting public sector diversity programs.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a major blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The lawsuit was filed by small businesses that import goods, and the court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce.

Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, said Trump might continue using tariffs but with more restraint, considering their mixed results. Wu suggests that such measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security. Optimism score is based on the potential for de-escalation and the consideration of more nuanced approaches.</p>

          <h2>German Defense Firm Renk Seeks Auto Sector Talent Amid Expansion</h2>

          <p>Tank parts maker Renk is targeting talent from the struggling auto sector to fuel its growth amid rising geopolitical tensions and increased military spending. The company is capitalizing on the experience of its CEO and COO, who have backgrounds in the automotive industry, to hire engineers and implement efficiency methods. While a trade union acknowledges the potential for job creation, it warns against a one-sided industrial policy focused on rearmament. Analysts suggest that the shift could benefit both industries by addressing overcapacity in the auto sector and scaling up the defense sector. This is strictly about governmental financial regulation, finance, or the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The Slovak government has introduced reforms, including a legal definition of segregation, but these measures often reinforce the very segregation they claim to address.
