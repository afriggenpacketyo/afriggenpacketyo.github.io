          <p>A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been conditionally bailed after being arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offense. The arrest followed an incident where Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused during a Premier League match against Liverpool at Anfield. The match was briefly paused in the 29th minute for the player to report the abuse to the referee. As part of his bail conditions, the man is banned from attending any regulated football matches in the UK and must stay at least one mile away from designated stadiums.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words this year, including several terms popularized by internet and social media culture. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a gibberish term from a viral YouTube series, and "tradwife," a shorthand for a traditional wife who promotes a domestic lifestyle online. Other additions reflect modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device used to feign activity while working remotely. Lexicographers note that the rapid evolution of internet culture is having a fascinating and observable effect on the English language.</p>

          <p>President Trump is hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war with Russia. The meeting follows Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin, after which the administration's focus shifted from a simple ceasefire to a broader, permanent peace deal. Key topics for discussion include security guarantees for Ukraine, which may resemble NATO's Article 5 protection, and the possibility of a land swap, a concession Ukraine has historically opposed. The talks occur as Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continue, underscoring the urgency of the diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously known as the last country without a national soccer team, has officially made its international debut in a tournament held in Springdale, Arkansas. The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese population, which provided enthusiastic support for the new team. Despite losing their opening matches, the team celebrated scoring its first-ever international goals, and the community expressed immense pride in finally having a team to represent them on the global stage. The event marks a significant cultural milestone for the small island nation and its diaspora.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick, potentially solving the nearly 60-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn. Authorities recovered the severely deteriorated vehicle and found human remains inside. The car's vehicle identification number confirmed it belonged to Benn, who was reported missing in September 1967 at the age of 59. While the remains await formal identification, investigators believe they belong to Benn, and his remaining family has been notified, bringing them closer to long-awaited closure.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is scheduled to provide a closed-door deposition to a congressional committee regarding his personal involvement in the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death. Barr took the unusual step of personally overseeing the inquiry, including reviewing surveillance footage, and publicly concurred with the suicide ruling. However, a recent CBS News analysis of the released video identified inconsistencies with official accounts, raising new questions about the events leading to Epstein's death. The hearing aims to scrutinize Barr's role and address lingering public suspicions surrounding the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is navigating a complex political path, balancing his identity as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) with the need to appeal to a broader electorate. The article details his deep connection to the DSA, which he credits for his political rise, while also noting his recent efforts to engage with mainstream Democratic figures like Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama. Mamdani's challenge is to leverage the organizational power of the socialist movement while transcending its more divisive ideological elements to govern a city of 8.5 million people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the United States has become strategically vulnerable to China by prioritizing legal and procedural frameworks over tangible production and infrastructure. It characterizes China as an "engineering state," where leaders with technical backgrounds have driven massive construction and manufacturing growth, making it a dominant global supplier. In contrast, the U.S. is portrayed as a "lawyerly society," obsessed with litigation, rules, and wealth protection, which has stifled its ability to build and innovate at scale. This fundamental difference, the article suggests, has geopolitical consequences, particularly in trade and technology.</p>

          <p>A recent column titled "Against Polling" by John Ganz has sparked a debate about the Democratic Party's reliance on political data and consultants. The column argues that polling is largely unreliable and that Democrats should focus more on historical context and bold rhetoric rather than data-driven strategies often described as "popularism." In response, this article defends the use of empirical data, asserting that while flawed, polling remains the most effective tool for understanding voter sentiment. The author contends that dismissing data wholesale risks allowing ideological bias to dictate electoral strategy, potentially harming the party's chances of winning.</p>

          <p>A recent spike in fatal aviation accidents across Africa has raised serious safety concerns, with experts pointing to systemic issues rather than mechanical failures. Industry analysts suggest that human error, inadequate pilot training, weak regulatory oversight, and a poor safety culture are primary contributing factors. Additionally, increasingly unpredictable weather patterns linked to climate change are posing new challenges for pilots. The article highlights that while modern aircraft have numerous redundant safety systems, negligence and a failure to adhere to international standards are creating a worrying trend in the continent's aviation sector.</p>

          <p>The White House and the Department of Homeland Security are increasingly using viral, often inflammatory, memes and retro-style artwork on their official social media accounts. This content, which celebrates the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, is highly polarizing, designed to appeal to supporters and provoke outrage from critics. Experts suggest the strategy is a form of modern agitprop that normalizes controversial policies and redefines a nationalist, white-centered vision of America. The posts often blend nostalgia with aggression, framing immigration enforcement as a necessary defense of the nation's heritage.</p>

They also argue that the tariffs raise production costs for domestic companies, potentially making them less competitive globally.

          <p>European Union envoys in Beijing are reportedly discussing a potential boycott of China's upcoming major military parade, scheduled to commemorate the end of World War II. The primary concern among the diplomats is the confirmed attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, especially as Moscow continues its intensified attacks on Ukraine. Sources indicate that the European missions are troubled by the prospect of being present at an event featuring the Russian leader, and potentially Russian troops, while the war in Ukraine persists. The situation presents a delicate diplomatic challenge for the EU in its relations with both China and Russia.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Donald Trump, has publicly called on India to cease its purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the practice as "opportunistic." In an op-ed, Navarro argued that India's actions undermine international sanctions aimed at isolating Russia's economy and that New Delhi must start acting like a strategic partner if it wants to be treated as one by the U.S. His comments highlight a point of friction between the two nations, following reports that trade negotiations were called off and the Trump administration plans to impose additional tariffs on India over the issue.

          <p>The city of Helsinki, Finland, has successfully recorded zero traffic-related deaths over the last year, a significant achievement for a city of its size. Officials attribute this success to the "Vision Zero" program, which implements smart city planning focused on safety. Key measures include reducing speed limits to 30 km/h (18.6 mph) on most city streets, redesigning infrastructure to protect pedestrians and cyclists, and using data analytics to identify and fix dangerous intersections. This proactive approach to traffic management serves as a model for other major cities aiming to eliminate road fatalities.</p>

He also condemned Beijing's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, stating that the conflict would not be possible without China's supply of dual-use goods.

          <p>A Guardian opinion column contends that Israel is systematically targeting and killing talented, professional Palestinian journalists in Gaza to eliminate credible witnesses to its military campaign. The author argues that these journalists convey a dignified and articulate image of Palestinians that contradicts Israel's narrative of a territory teeming with militants. By assassinating reporters and then attempting to posthumously link them to militant groups, Israel aims to control the global perception of the conflict. The article asserts that this strategy seeks to annihilate not just the flow of information, but the very humanity of the Palestinian voice.</p>

          <p>In a potential breakthrough for treating neuropsychiatric disorders, Chinese scientists have successfully converted human stem cells into dopamine-producing neurons and transplanted them into mice. The research, published in Cell Stem Cell, found that the grafted cells helped reduce depressive behaviors like anxiety and anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure) in the test subjects. This proof-of-concept study suggests that cell therapy could one day be used to repair dysfunctional neural circuits in the human brain that are associated with mood regulation, offering a new avenue for treating conditions like major depressive disorder.</p>

The silence stemmed from a controversial penalty Rooney won after a challenge from Campbell, which led to Manchester United's first goal in their 2-0 victory. Rooney stated that Campbell was convinced he had dived, leading to a prolonged period of animosity between the two, even during international duty.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Pakistan's northwestern Buner district has risen to at least 274 after rescuers recovered dozens more bodies from collapsed homes. The disaster was triggered by unusually heavy monsoon rains and cloudbursts that residents say they were not warned about in time to evacuate. Authorities have defended their response, stating the deluge was too sudden to predict its exact location, and have asserted that Pakistan does not currently require foreign aid. The event highlights the country's extreme vulnerability to climate change, which experts say is intensifying the frequency of such severe weather events.</p>
