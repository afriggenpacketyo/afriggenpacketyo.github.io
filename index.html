          <p>Despite a broader slowdown in luxury spending, the world's wealthiest shoppers continue to purchase high-end jewelry, particularly from sought-after brands like Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati, and Cartier, all owned by Swiss luxury group Richemont. According to Luca Solca, sector head for global luxury goods at Bernstein, Richemont's jewelry brands are highly desirable, outperforming competitors like LVMH. This trend contributed to Richemont's better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, with its Jewellery Maisons division experiencing 11% growth, and jewelry being the group's strongest segment overall with 8% growth for the full year. This indicates a sustained demand for top-tier luxury jewelry despite economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings about dangerous road conditions. The storm, unusual for the region, dropped visibility to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport, marking the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville issued a dust storm warning for Chicago. Meteorologist Zachary Yack noted the rapid decline in visibility, attributing the storm to exceptionally dry soil conditions in central Illinois. Such storms are more common in the desert Southwest and southern Great Plains, with Chicago last experiencing a similar event during the Dust Bowl era in 1934, according to the article.</p>

          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, resulting in two deaths and numerous injuries among the 277 people on board. According to Mayor Eric Adams, the ship lost power before the collision, causing its mast to hit the bridge and break apart. Bridge inspectors found no structural damage to the bridge itself, and the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. stated that the ship was en route from Cozumel, Mexico, to Iceland. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct a full investigation into the incident, which prompted a temporary shutdown of the bridge.</p>

          <p>Despite India's aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power, the country's ongoing conflict with Pakistan continues to pose strategic challenges. While Indian forces managed to inflict damage on Pakistani air bases during recent combat, the clash ultimately equates India with a smaller, weaker nation, undermining its global image. The article highlights the difficulty India faces in resolving its 78-year conflict with Pakistan, especially given the threat of nuclear escalation and the involvement of global powers like the U.S. and China. Shivshankar Menon, a former national security adviser, notes the unfortunate diversion of India's resources and efforts towards managing terrorism from Pakistan.</p>

The election is also testing the strength of other political forces, including the far-right candidate SÅ‚awomir Mentzen.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers, but the Angels secured an 11-9 victory, preventing a celebratory return for the veteran pitcher. Kershaw struggled in the first inning, allowing three runs, but recovered to pitch four innings. Despite Kershaw's return, the Dodgers are facing injuries to key starters, with manager Dave Roberts hoping Kershaw's presence will boost the team's intensity. Logan Oâ€™Hoppe had a career-high five RBIs for the Angels, while Freddie Freeman had four hits for the Dodgers.

          <p>Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling them 'absolute losers' and feeling 'incredibly betrayed.' He argues that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment amounts to 'theft, thievery on a high scale,' particularly harming young artists who lack resources to fight big tech. The government's rejection of House of Lords proposals to ensure copyright holders' permission is required for AI use has sparked outrage. Sir Elton warned the government was on course to 'rob young people of their legacy and their income,' and threatened legal action if the plans are not changed.</p>

          <p>The establishment of a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine offers a glimmer of hope for justice, but faces significant challenges due to the rejection of international jurisdiction by autocratic allies and powerful states, including the US. This article argues that international law, the foundation of the post-1945 global order, is being undermined by politicians and governments who should be upholding it. The ineffectiveness of the UN Security Council and the slow progress of the International Criminal Court further exacerbate the crisis in international law enforcement. The author contends that a lack of respect for law and moral confusion among political leaders are leading to a collapse of peaceful coexistence and a descent into the law of the jungle.</p>

          <p>This article argues that while President Trump's foreign deals and his family's profiteering are blatant examples of presidential corruption, they are part of a larger pattern of foreign regimes and oligarchs targeting American politics. The author points to the Trump family's various ventures, such as the Executive Branch club and cryptocurrency deals, as well as Joe Biden's pardon of his son Hunter, to illustrate how American politicians have long been for sale. The author suggests legislative actions to prevent former politicians from serving as foreign lobbyists and to restrict the financial arrangements of administration family members. Ultimately, the author argues that addressing foreign corruption requires a broader effort to enforce existing laws and reinstate counter-kleptocracy measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article contrasts Europe's revitalized sleeper train network with America's struggling public infrastructure, arguing that the U.S. is sleepwalking into a transport dead end. In President Trumpâ€™s second term, with climate commitments and environmental protections already up in smoke, the road ahead seems clear: more gas-guzzling cars, planes and rockets. The national rail system is written off as either irreparably broken (like the long-suffering Amtrak) or a mismanaged white elephant (as with several stalled high-speed rail projects). While Europe invests in rail infrastructure, America continues to prioritize cars and unproven transportation projects, neglecting the potential for trains to offer a more sustainable and community-oriented travel experience. The author advocates for revitalizing railways in America to provide an alternative way ahead.</p>

The database, containing nearly 750,000 entries and $136 million in payments, allowed the reporter to identify the highest-earning doctors and solicit reader feedback on their own doctors' industry connections. Reader reactions varied, with some expressing concern about potential impacts on care quality and cost, while others maintained trust in their doctors regardless of industry ties. The article highlights the importance of publicly available data in uncovering and examining potential conflicts of interest in healthcare.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated on Saturday, according to the U.N. refugee agency. The repatriation, involving mostly women and children, was facilitated after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region, and is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR. Returnees expressed happiness at returning to their ancestral land, with authorities emphasizing their value to the country's development. The refugees were among the hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda after the genocide, with many having stayed and joined Congo's army, leading to decades of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern Congo.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are moving towards a new era of cooperation, highlighted by a summit in London expected to include a defense pact, as the United States under President Trump pulls back from global leadership. Despite past tensions over Brexit, both sides recognize the need to work together on defense, trade, and energy cooperation in an increasingly turbulent world. While challenges remain, including fishing rights and trade controls, the summit underscores a commitment to strengthening alliances and addressing shared problems. However, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces opposition from Brexit supporters and a hostile media landscape, making progress politically risky.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent Middle East diplomacy has largely sidelined Israel, as evidenced by his engagement with Syria's new leader and efforts to negotiate peace deals in Iran and Yemen without direct involvement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While the U.S. maintains its historic ties and support for Israel, Trump's actions indicate a shift in priorities towards the Gulf States, driven by economic interests and a perceived stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This shift has raised concerns in Israel, where officials fear that Trump's decisions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria, could empower extremist forces and undermine Israeli security.</p>

          <p>Despite growing regret among British people about Brexit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces significant opposition from the national news media as he attempts to mend ties with the European Union. Conservative political opponents and tabloid newspapers have branded the upcoming summit with EU leaders as a 'surrender summit,' reflecting the lingering divisions over Brexit. Although most Britons now believe leaving the EU was a mistake, the media's focus on sovereignty and national identity complicates Starmer's efforts to pursue closer ties with Europe. The article examines the political challenges and media narratives surrounding Britain's relationship with the EU.</p>
