          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry reports that recent Israeli strikes across Gaza have resulted in at least 81 Palestinian deaths and over 400 injuries. One notable incident near a Gaza City stadium, used to shelter displaced people, killed at least 11 individuals, including children. These attacks continue as mediators work to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, though negotiations with Israel are reportedly stalled. Meanwhile, protesters in Tel Aviv have rallied, demanding an agreement to free the remaining Israeli hostages.</p>

          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. Despite the merger with OneWeb, experts express doubt about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale, citing its much smaller satellite constellation and reliance on U.S. launch services. While the investment signals a strategic push for Europe's technological sovereignty, analysts believe Eutelsat is better positioned to serve niche sovereign and enterprise markets rather than compete directly in the mass-market broadband segment.

          <p>Located just miles from mainland China but governed by Taipei, Quemoy Island serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transitioned into a quiet community that reveals the constraints on both Beijing's and Taipei's influence. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance model, the island's current state shows a complex reality where it is caught between two competing political systems. This demonstrates the practical difficulties each side faces in asserting complete control.</p>

          <p>Chinese civil servants in some regions are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent and unpredictable local austerity measures that often go beyond central government regulations. An official in Sichuan province reported that his department head implemented a dine-out ban, reflecting a phenomenon known as "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control at the local level. This shift in lifestyle is a direct consequence of the pressure on local officials to demonstrate fiscal discipline and avoid any perception of extravagance amid broader anti-corruption campaigns.</p>

The 51-49 vote followed hours of intense negotiations, with several Republican holdouts ultimately agreeing to advance the legislation after securing concessions. The passage was a significant victory for Senate Republican leadership, who aim to get the bill to the president's desk by July 4. However, the bill still faces a final vote and potential opposition in the House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A brush fire, named the Lake fire, broke out near Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County on Saturday afternoon, quickly growing to 478 acres with zero containment. The blaze forced the evacuation of over 100 people who were at the reservoir, including campers and boaters, with some temporarily stranded before being moved to safety. Mandatory evacuation orders are in effect for areas south of Highway 138. Fire crews are battling the flames from the ground and air, with gusty winds posing a challenge to suppression efforts.</p>

          <p>After 45 years, the iconic Sheffield music venue The Leadmill has hosted its final event, following a long dispute with the building's landlords. The closure marks the end of an era for a venue that helped launch bands like Pulp and Arctic Monkeys and was a cultural hub for generations of music fans. Musicians such as Richard Hawley have lamented the loss, comparing it to Liverpool's Cavern Club. While the new owners state it will remain a music venue, the original management is gone, leaving many staff and patrons feeling gutted about losing a beloved grassroots institution.</p>

Under the voluntary initiative, retailers will be asked to help customers make healthier choices, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulation. The plan, which is part of a broader strategy to relieve pressure on the NHS, will require major food businesses to report on their sales of healthy food to increase accountability.

          <p>The most-watched season of "Love Island USA" has been accompanied by intense cyberbullying of its contestants, prompting the show and its host to plead with viewers to stop the harassment. This article examines the dark side of reality TV fame, drawing parallels to the UK "Love Island" franchise, where two former contestants died by suicide, leading to a government inquiry. While producers say they have improved mental health support and duty of care protocols, psychologists note the challenge of balancing the need for on-screen drama with the welfare of participants in an era of relentless social media scrutiny.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric aimed at the judiciary. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts stated that when politicians frame judges as part of a political dispute, it can incite threats and violence. Without naming specific individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to respond to comments from both Republican and Democratic leaders. His remarks underscore growing concerns about the safety of judges and the need for politicians to exercise restraint in their criticism of court decisions.</p>

President Vucic has accused the protesters of being part of a foreign plot and has refused calls for a snap election.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Hard, dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain solar energy, releasing it slowly and elevating temperatures, especially at night. The lack of vegetation and water, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, exacerbates the effect. With climate change making heatwaves more frequent and intense, the growing populations of urban centers are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and its associated health risks.</p>
