          <p>The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, dismissed the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility visit. Habba stated the dismissal was "for the sake of moving forward" as Baraka is running for governor. Simultaneously, Habba charged U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting and interfering with law enforcement during the same visit. Baraka and McIver have been critical of the ICE facility, citing safety concerns, while Habba invited Baraka to tour the facility, asserting the government has nothing to hide.

          <p>A Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Seville experienced a critical situation when the co-pilot became incapacitated while the captain was outside the cockpit in February 2024. The report from Spain's Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility revealed the plane flew unsupervised for approximately 10 minutes with the autopilot engaged. The captain was unable to re-enter the cockpit immediately due to security protocols, but the co-pilot eventually opened the door after the captain used the emergency code. A doctor on board diagnosed the co-pilot with a possible heart condition, and the flight was diverted to Madrid, landing safely with no further incident.

          <p>A divided panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with a 20-year-old Venezuelan man, identified as "Cristian," who was seeking to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a previous order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return, stating that his removal violated a class action settlement. Cristian was deported after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, but the court found this to be a breach of the 2024 settlement agreement, which guaranteed his asylum application would be adjudicated on its merits. The dissenting judge argued that returning Cristian would be futile, given his alleged gang affiliation and felony drug conviction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which aims to combat online sexual exploitation, including the use of AI to create fake images. The bill makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent and requires websites to remove such material within 48 hours of a request. First Lady Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, called it a ‚Äúnational victory‚Äù that will protect children from online exploitation. The law received bipartisan support but has faced criticism from free speech advocates who fear it could lead to censorship and government monitoring.</p>

This involves understating the value of goods or mislabeling them, routing shipments through shell companies acting as "importers of record." These companies often default on tariff payments, utilizing a minimum $50,000 customs bond before ceasing operations and setting up new entities. The practice is reportedly widespread, with U.S. firms increasingly seeking ways to sidestep tariffs, highlighting the challenges in enforcing trade regulations and the risks associated with these illicit activities.

After receiving criticism and a call from the Secret Service, Comey removed the post, stating he did not want to be associated with violence. He warned that the episode pointed to a more worrying trend by the Trump administration: the use of power to aim at individuals, eroding the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) provided an update on the Mexican navy ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, expressing condolences for the two sailors who died. The investigation will include examining the crew, the vessel, and the environmental conditions, with a preliminary report expected in about 30 days. The ship began backing away from the dock with tugboat assistance at 8:20 p.m., striking the bridge four minutes later and coming to a stop at 8:27 p.m. The NTSB is working with the Mexican government to access the ship and its recorders, with the bridge deemed safe following the incident.</p>

          <p>Drake is pushing for Tory Lanez to be pardoned after he was stabbed 14 times in prison, resulting in collapsed lungs. Lanez is currently serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion. Drake shared a petition asking California's governor to grant Lanez a "full pardon", which now has about 270,000 signatures. The petition points to arguments questioning both evidence and witness accounts in the case. The prisoner suspected of the attack is serving a life sentence for second-degree murder and other violent offences.</p>
