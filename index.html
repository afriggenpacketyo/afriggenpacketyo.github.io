          <p>Amid a power vacuum following the fall of Syria's Assad regime, Israel is escalating its military actions with several objectives. These include creating an informal buffer zone in southern Syria, preventing advanced weaponry from reaching the new government, and weakening the Syrian state to mitigate future threats. Analysts also suggest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu may be using the conflict to distract from domestic political pressures, including his ongoing corruption trial and increasing fragility within his coalition government.</p>
