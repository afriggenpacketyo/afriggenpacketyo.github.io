          <h2>Nintendo Switch 2 Launches Amid Fan Excitement and Supply Constraints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 07:34:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has launched globally, marked by midnight store openings and high demand, with some retailers reporting record pre-orders. Despite initial excitement, Game cancelled some pre-orders, and Nintendo briefly paused pre-orders in the U.S. due to tariff concerns. The Switch 2 represents a strategic shift for Nintendo, being a direct sequel and retaining the hybrid console design, boasting a larger screen and improved performance. The console launches with Mario Kart World, while upgraded versions of Zelda games will also be available, and gamers can also look forward to third-party titles like Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, Cyberpunk 2077, and Bravely Default.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of Judy Weinstein-Hagi and Gadi Hagi, two Israeli-American hostages killed during the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. The couple's bodies were found in the Khan Younis area of the southern Gaza Strip and returned to Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to continue efforts to recover all hostages, living and deceased. The IDF determined the couple were killed during Hamas' surprise attack by the same terror group that abducted and killed Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas and her two young children. Fifty-six hostages remain in Gaza, with 20 believed to be alive, including two Americans, Itay Chen and Omer Neutra, who are presumed dead.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is evaluating the potential purchase of Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets, the same model that reportedly downed a French-built Rafale warplane during a recent conflict between India and Pakistan. According to Indonesiaâ€™s deputy minister of defence, China offered to sell the jets during a recent arms fair, and the country is considering the offer. Indonesia could procure defense equipment from any nation, but the government must consider integrating new planes with existing equipment. Earlier this year, China and Indonesia committed to enhancing military cooperation, conducting a joint drill in November of the previous year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns due to insufficient vetting processes. The policy also partially restricts entrance for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The new policy applies to foreigners from the named countries who are outside of the United States and who lack visas to enter as of Monday, June 9, while exceptions are made for U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with clear evidence of identity and family relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has stated that an error in car tax data caused the April inflation rate to be overstated by 0.1 percentage points. The ONS initially reported the annual rate at 3.5%, but revised data shows the consumer price index rose by 3.4% in the 12 months to April. The error involved incorrect Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport, overstating the number of vehicles subject to VED rates in the first year of registration. The ONS apologized for the error and said it would use the correctly weighted data from May 2025's figures onward, meaning no further statistics will be affected.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's criticism of President Trump's proposed spending bill has been met with dismissal from Senate Republicans, who are proceeding with their own adjustments to the legislation. Despite Musk's call to "KILL the BILL" due to concerns about the national debt, senators are focused on shaping the bill according to their priorities. Some lawmakers believe Musk's opposition is driven by concerns over the potential loss of electric vehicle tax credits that benefit his company. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would cut $1.3 trillion but add $2.4 trillion to the deficit.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has recovered the bodies of two Western hostages, Judy Weinstein Haggai and Gad Haggai, in an operation near Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The couple, who held U.S. and Canadian citizenship, were killed in southern Israel during the October 7, 2023, attack, and their bodies were taken to Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades. The recovery operation was based on intelligence gathered by the Hostages and Missing Persons headquarters. Two U.S.-Israeli citizens remain missing in Gaza, with a total of around 36 deceased and about 20 living hostages still captive.</p>

          <p>Louisiana's legislature has passed a law outlawing attempts to gain childrenâ€™s trust with the intent to commit sexual assault, championed by a survivor of Catholic clergy molestation, his wife, and her father, a state lawmaker. The law makes it illegal to pursue an intimate relationship with a child under 17 through manipulation, threats, or coercion with the intent to commit a sex offense. The law applies when offenders are at least four years older than the child, even if no abuse has occurred. The effort was inspired by the experience of Tim Gioe, who was abused by a priest, and aims to prevent similar cases by allowing authorities to intervene earlier.</p>

Synagogues have increased security measures, including armed guards and surveillance systems, in response to rising antisemitism. The community is divided on the root causes of the violence, with some attributing it to a rising wave of antisemitism fueled by the pro-Palestinian movement, while others see it as a consequence of conflating Judaism with support for Israel. Calls are growing for increased funding for security at Jewish institutions and for a national conversation on distinguishing between free speech and incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>The practice of embryo 'adoption,' where families donate unused embryos to others seeking to conceive, is being used by the Christian right to critique IVF. The Alabama Supreme Court's ruling that embryos should be legally recognized as 'extrauterine children' has intensified the debate, with some leaders calling for restrictions on IVF. Christian groups are promoting embryo adoption as an alternative, viewing embryos as 'preborn' children deserving a chance at life. However, experts warn that giving embryos legal status could threaten both IVF and embryo adoption, and may serve a broader Christian nationalist agenda.</p>

The investigation, led by attorney Alex Spiro, aims to determine the influence of DEI policies on the hiring of air traffic controllers. Air traffic controllers have criticized the probe as a waste of money, arguing that qualifications and training are the primary factors in ensuring safety. The investigation includes interviews with key stakeholders, statistical analysis, and legal analysis, with the possibility of additional costs if the investigation extends beyond the initial timeframe.</p>
