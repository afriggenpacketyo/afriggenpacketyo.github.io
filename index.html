          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed a significant Republican-led tax and spending bill, requiring a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The legislation aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent while increasing funding for border security and defense, financed partly by cuts to health and nutrition programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Key provisions include new work requirements for Medicaid, an increased SALT deduction cap, and a higher debt ceiling. The bill, which passed through the budget reconciliation process, now returns to the House for approval before it can be sent to the president. (not investment advice)</p>

Rights groups allege that security forces used violence against protesters, citing seven deaths, while the government attributes the deaths to drowning.

          <p>German prosecutors have announced the arrest of a Danish citizen, identified as Ali S., on suspicion of spying for an Iranian intelligence service. The individual is accused of gathering information on Jewish individuals and sites in Berlin, potentially in preparation for terrorist attacks. According to reports, the suspect took photos of locations including the headquarters of the German-Israeli Society, allegedly on orders from Iran's Quds Force.

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from proceeding with mass layoffs and a major agency overhaul. The ruling found "no rational basis" for the administration's plan, which critics warned could have devastating consequences for public health services nationwide. The lawsuit was initiated by 19 Democratic attorneys general who argued the restructuring would paralyze the agency. This decision temporarily halts the plan to lay off approximately 10,000 employees and create a new agency, pending further legal review.</p>

          <p>According to newly declassified documents obtained by Fox News, the FBI allegedly blocked an investigation into a purported Chinese Communist Party scheme to influence the 2020 U.S. election. The probe concerned fake driver's licenses intended for individuals who would vote for Joe Biden. The documents suggest the intelligence report was recalled because it would "contradict" then-Director Christopher Wray's congressional testimony that no coordinated national voter fraud had been seen. FBI officials in the Albany field office reportedly disagreed with the decision, expressing concern that it was politically motivated and undermined the intelligence process.</p>

President Trump echoed the threat, also criticizing CNN's reporting on a U.S. military strike in Iran.

          <p>Recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in California's agricultural regions have created significant labor shortages, causing crops to rot unharvested in the fields. Farmers and farmworkers report that a large percentage of the workforce, many of whom are undocumented immigrants, have stopped showing up to work out of fear of deportation. This disruption threatens the state's multi-billion dollar agricultural industry and could lead to higher food prices for consumers.

However, this solution is not universally suitable, as it requires a significant minimum debt and can negatively impact one's credit score. This article suggests that while immediate action is better than waiting for interest rates to fall, individuals should also explore alternatives like debt management plans or consolidation loans. Ultimately, the best course of action depends on a person's specific financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate-approved Republican spending package contains numerous provisions that could significantly affect household finances across the United States. This comprehensive guide breaks down key measures, including a proposed increase of the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 and a permanent boost to the child tax credit. The bill also introduces a new 'bonus' deduction for seniors and potential cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Other major changes involve new tax-advantaged 'Trump accounts' for children's savings and substantial reforms to federal student loan programs, including lower borrowing limits.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The spending package passed by Senate Republicans includes an expansion of the child tax credit, a move that could benefit many American families. The bill proposes to permanently raise the maximum credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child and index it to inflation, differing from the House version's temporary increase to $2,500. However, policy experts note that the proposed changes would not benefit the lowest-income families, as an estimated 17 million children are in households that do not earn enough to qualify for the full credit. The legislation now moves to the House for further consideration.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant rally after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated the measure is necessary to control the flow of migrants, acknowledging the impact on free movement but seeing no alternative. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended Germany's own border control policies, stating they are a temporary necessity due to inadequate protection of the EU's external borders. Both leaders emphasized a desire for cooperation to solve what they describe as a common problem.</p>

Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for several regions until Wednesday morning. While temperatures are expected to cool, the event is part of a broader, intense heatwave gripping much of Europe and follows the UK's warmest-ever spring.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed states it is withholding more than $6 billion in federal education grants, a move that is expected to disrupt school district planning for the upcoming school year. The Education Department stated it is reviewing funding for five grant programs, including those for teacher professional development, migrant education, and after-school activities. School officials called the decision unprecedented and disruptive, as districts rely on this stable funding for budgeting. The administration's proposed budget for the next fiscal year had already sought to eliminate all five of the grants now under review.</p>

          <h2>Business Professor Shares Key Question to Ask in Job Interviews</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 12:40:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch, there is one crucial question that job seekers should ask at the end of an interview to uncover a company's true values: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often catches managers off guard, leading to more honest and revealing answers than direct inquiries about company culture. The responses can provide valuable insight into a company's real expectations regarding work-life balance, collaboration, and social dynamics. This strategy helps candidates assess whether a company's values align with their own, leading to better job satisfaction and retention.</p>
