            <p>A small Cessna 310R plane crashed in Boca Raton, Florida, shortly after taking off from Boca Raton Airport, killing all three people on board. The aircraft, which was headed to Tallahassee International Airport, experienced mechanical issues before crashing near Military Trail. A man in a nearby car suffered non-life-threatening injuries after debris and fire from the crash impacted his vehicle. The crash site, located on railroad tracks near a road, is under investigation by the FAA and NTSB, and authorities have expressed their condolences to the families of the victims.

            <p>President Donald Trump underwent his annual physical examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, his first such exam of his second term. While Trump claimed to feel great, the public has not received detailed health information since 2018. Previous examinations revealed high cholesterol, which is being managed with medication, and a slightly elevated BMI. During his first term, Trump was hospitalized with COVID-19, requiring supplemental oxygen and experimental treatments. Trump's health has been a subject of public interest and scrutiny, particularly after an assassination attempt in 2024 left him with a gunshot wound to the ear.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies have triggered a global market sell-off, causing the dollar to plummet to a three-year low and raising concerns about its status as a safe haven currency. Investors are questioning the dollar's long-held position as the world's primary reserve currency due to worries over the US economy and unpredictable policy changes. Experts suggest that Trump's actions are undermining confidence in the dollar, potentially accelerating its erosion as the dominant global currency. The situation is further complicated by fears of a US recession and the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The world's longest-lasting pig organ transplant has failed after Towana Looney's body rejected the genetically modified pig kidney. Looney, 53, had the kidney removed on April 4, after it functioned well for over four months, allowing her to live without dialysis for the first time in nine years. The rejection appeared to be caused by a reduction in her antirejection medication due to an infection. Doctors hope that genetically modified pig organs may someday alleviate the organ shortage, as more than 103,000 people are waiting for organ transplants in the U.S.</p>

China has filed an additional complaint with the WTO over U.S. tariffs, highlighting the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries.

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The most significant animal welfare issue in the meat industry is the genetic modification of farmed animals, particularly chickens. Over the past 80 years, chickens have been bred to grow as large as possible in a short amount of time, leading to health problems such as lameness and heart failure. This rapid growth takes a toll on the chickens' bodies, with many in pain due to lameness, or difficulty walking. The problem has been largely invisible to consumers, making it difficult for animal advocates to make progress. Banning the most apparent cruel livestock industry practices may be obvious and sensible things to do in the eyes of most consumers. But “better genetics” isn’t as intuitive and doesn’t quite have the same ring as “ban cages” or “stop mutilating animals.” It’s also a more fundamental challenge to factory farms’ business model.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's erratic policies and trade wars are diverting global attention and resources away from critical issues such as climate change and international conflicts. The world is forced to monitor and react to Trump's whims, consuming political and intellectual energy that could be directed towards solving pressing problems. Examples include the climate emergency, the civil war in Sudan, and conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. The author argues that Trump's actions are creating a state of permanent crisis, hindering the international community's ability to address urgent global challenges.</p>

Data shows significant inflows from retail traders into U.S. stocks, even as institutional investors retreated. These retail investors are raising their exposure to an increasingly risky market. Some of the trading activity is tied to speculation around Trump's tariff policies. The logic, he said, goes something like this: If it's mostly worked and produced great returns over the last 15 years, why stop now? (not investment advice)</p>

China has retaliated against Trump's tariffs, signaling a calm resolve and portraying the trade war as an American effort to contain China's economic success. While China faces risks from the trade war, it also has leverage and is committed to resisting pressure from the United States.</p>
