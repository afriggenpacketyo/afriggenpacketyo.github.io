          <p>Russian forces conducted a deadly overnight drone attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulting in the deaths of at least two people, including a one-year-old baby, and injuring 13 others. Multiple residential buildings in the Svyatoshynkyi and Darnytskyi districts were partially destroyed and engulfed in flames, with a government building also catching fire. This latest assault follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's hardening warnings to the West regarding aid to Ukraine, as Moscow currently controls approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian officials assert that these strikes deliberately target civilian facilities, underscoring the severe and ongoing human cost of the conflict and the persistent need for robust air defenses across the nation.</p>

          <p>Two winning tickets, sold in Missouri and Texas, have claimed the nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, marking the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history after more than three months without a big winner. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62 with Powerball 17. The fortunate ticketholders will share the immense prize, choosing between a lump sum cash payment of $410.3 million or $893.5 million spread over 30 annual payments that increase by 5% each year. This monumental win concludes the 42nd drawing since the last jackpot, a streak that tied the game's record for the most consecutive drawings without a top prize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that appeasing Donald Trump consistently leads to negative outcomes for international leaders, citing examples like Narendra Modi, Emmanuel Macron, and Ursula von der Leyen. The author suggests that Trump's relationships are personal and impermanent, driven by ego rather than strategic interests. The article warns UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer against his perceived "Trump-whisperer" act ahead of an upcoming state visit, highlighting a lack of tangible benefits for Britain. It posits that resistance, rather than subservience, is the more effective approach when dealing with the former U.S. President, as demonstrated by figures like Xi Jinping and Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy is launching his first major tour in 45 years, requiring him to relearn his own songs and guitar skills. The 66-year-old, who achieved fame in the 1970s as a pop star and actor, largely stepped away from the spotlight to become a television writer and producer. Cassidy revealed he is taking on the new challenge of playing bass for his 50-city "The Road to Us Tour," which will feature classic hits, new music, and personal stories from his unusual career trajectory. He noted that not having sung for decades has kept his voice fresh, and he now embraces a role as a storyteller, having never truly enjoyed being a public figure.</p>

The article highlights a defense that was often slow and out of position, coupled with an offense that struggled to sustain drives, with crucial plays consistently benefiting the opposing team. Despite a late fourth-quarter surge that provided a chance to force overtime, a critical interception ended the Bruins' hopes, leading to their first 0-2 start since 2019. This result significantly increases pressure on coach DeShaun Foster in his second season, prompting concerns about the team's overall performance and strategic direction.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. The process involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets on the surface to boil and trigger the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles reach a critical size, they suddenly collapse, releasing energy and creating a strong force capable of launching jumpers 1.5 meters into the air. This technique, detailed in the peer-reviewed journal Science, also allows for controlling how and where these jumpers launch, and even enables the small pieces of material to swim in water, showcasing cavitation as an efficient new launching mechanism.</p>

          <h2>Initiative Seeks Greater Recognition and Support for Female Military Veterans</h2>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, co-founded "Sisters in Service" to advocate for greater recognition and support for female military veterans, particularly those who performed dangerous front-line roles. The community interest company helps female veterans working in healthcare connect and support each other, addressing the isolation many feel due to outdated perceptions of women's military experiences. Dr. Bennett highlights that women often deploy alongside men and face unique challenges upon returning to civilian life, frequently avoiding traditional veteran spaces like Royal British Legion clubs. The initiative aims to provide a "cathartic" community where shared experiences can be openly discussed, fostering crucial connection and well-being.</p>

          <p>Mount Sinai, a site revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is at the center of a controversy over Egypt's "Great Transfiguration Project" to develop it into a luxury tourist mega-resort. The plans include hotels, villas, and a cable car, leading to the demolition of homes and eco-camps of the indigenous Bedouin community, the Jebeleya tribe, with little compensation. Critics, including British travel writer Ben Hoffler, argue this top-down development disregards the Bedouin's wishes and threatens their traditional way of life and the site's Unesco World Heritage status. Unesco itself has expressed concerns and called for a conservation plan, which has not yet materialized.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation, dubbed "Patriot 2.0," in Massachusetts, specifically targeting immigrants in so-called "sanctuary cities." This operation, expected to last several weeks, focuses on individuals who have been released from local custody despite ICE agents attempting to pick them up from local jails. Local officials, including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, have strongly pushed back against these federal actions, defending their city's sanctuary policies as crucial for public safety and community trust. Tensions have been building between the Trump administration and sanctuary cities, with DHS criticizing such policies for allegedly harboring criminals and putting American lives at risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial investigative report into the deadly Lisbon funicular crash revealed that a cable linking the two cabins snapped shortly before the derailment. The report by Portugal's air and rail accident investigations bureau (GPIAAF) stated that the cable had passed a visual check hours before the accident, detecting no anomalies in the cable or braking systems. The Glória funicular, a 140-year-old yellow railway car, swerved off its tracks near Avenida da Liberdade and crashed into a building, resulting in 16 fatalities and 21 injuries. Inspectors found the accident occurred in under 50 seconds after the cabins lost their balancing force, with two independent investigations now underway to determine the full circumstances.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively employing military decoys, ranging from inflatable tanks and flat-pack artillery models to radar-reflecting imitations, to deceive Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition. These full-scale imitations are designed to mimic real equipment, often complete with wheel ruts and other realistic details, effectively drawing enemy fire. The article highlights that up to half of some weapon types deployed are actually decoys, with Russian Lancet kamikaze drones, costing approximately $35,000, frequently targeting $500-$600 plywood models. This clever tactic not only saves expensive resources but also demonstrates Ukrainian ingenuity in wartime, aiming to overload Russian air defenses and misdirect their attacks.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born boy who tragically died at 15 from leukemia, is set to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in a ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis famously created websites documenting miracles as a means of spreading Catholic teaching online. His baptism took place at Our Lady of Dolours Church in Chelsea, London, which has experienced an increase in visitors since his canonization announcement. The process required proving two miracles, which his mother attributes to prayers offered after his death. His story particularly resonates with young Catholics who find him relatable for his use of technology and modern interests, offering an inspiring contemporary figure of faith.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team suffered a listless 2-0 defeat to South Korea, extending a pattern of disappointing results and raising alarm bells ahead of the upcoming home World Cup. Despite coach Mauricio Pochettino's stated goal of player evaluation, the team displayed a notable lack of communication in defense and repeatedly failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities. Son Heung-min scored the opening goal, highlighting the USMNT's disjointedness and South Korea's attacking verve. Pochettino acknowledges the team's need for results but maintains they will be ready for the World Cup, yet this performance underscores significant challenges for a squad hoping to make an impact on the world stage.</p>
