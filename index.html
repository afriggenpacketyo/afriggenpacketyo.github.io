            <p>President Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, urging him to lower interest rates, which contributed to a stock market decline. The market also reacted to ongoing tariff policies implemented by the Trump administration, creating uncertainty for investors. A recent CNBC poll indicated that a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's tariff policy and handling of inflation. The Federal Reserve's caution in easing rates contrasts with the European Central Bank's recent rate cut, adding to the economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Department of Education announced it will resume "involuntary collections" on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5, using the Treasury Offset Program to withhold payments like tax refunds and Social Security benefits.

            <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. The lawsuit claims the administration's actions are a pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to government control over its academic programs. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. The Trump administration's demands included changes to diversity policies, a ban on masks at campus protests, and audits of Harvard programs.</p>

            <p>A New York Times report reveals that former President Joe Biden privately believed transgender athletes might have an unfair advantage against biological women in sports. While his administration proposed redefining sex in Title IX as "gender identity," Biden reportedly held reservations about the competitive aspect of sports. Polling suggests that approximately 80% of Americans agree with Biden's reported stance on the issue. President Trump has since signed an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing against biological girls, though some states have defied this order.</p>

            <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, has been convicted on all 15 counts in her bribery trial. She was found guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors to benefit the government of Egypt and enrich themselves. Her husband resigned his U.S. Senate seat after being found guilty of accepting bribes and was sentenced to 11 years in prison. The case involved lavish gifts, including gold bars and cash, found during an FBI search of the couple's home.</p>

            <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is not "reasonable," as required by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ACLU argues that alleged Nazis were afforded more rights after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under the Trump administration. The case raises questions about the legal rights of migrants to challenge government allegations before being removed from the U.S.</p>

Captain Josh Brownhill joked that the team had "bored our way to the Premier League" due to their defensive stability. The team's consistency and numerous clean sheets have been key to their success. Burnley is on course to reach 100 points and match Reading's record 33-game unbeaten run in the second tier.</p>

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and average interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating credit card debt can be a beneficial strategy for many. Consolidating debt into a lower-rate personal loan or balance transfer card can lead to significant savings on interest and simplify financial management. However, the effectiveness of debt consolidation depends on an individual's credit profile, with those having good to excellent credit being most likely to qualify for favorable loan terms.
