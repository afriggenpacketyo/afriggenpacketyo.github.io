          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a substantial reduction in the number of individuals listed as missing following severe floods earlier this month. Through extensive follow-up by state and local agencies, the count dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Many people initially reported as unaccounted for have since been confirmed safe. While this marks a positive development in the recovery effort, the overall death toll from the statewide flooding remains high at 134, with Kerr County being the most affected region.</p>

          <p>A 2016 Wisconsin murder case saw technology play a pivotal role in delivering justice for the death of Nicole Vander Heyden. Her boyfriend, initially the prime suspect, was exonerated by data from his Fitbit fitness tracker, which corroborated his alibi. Investigators then used DNA evidence from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Burch, who had no prior connection to the victim. Burch's location data from his Google Dashboard ultimately placed him at the key locations, leading to his conviction and a life sentence.</p>

          <p>Animal rescue volunteers discovered more than 400 guinea pigs living in deplorable conditions at a residence in South Los Angeles. The animals were found to be overcrowded, lacking proper food and water, and suffering from various medical issues, including open wounds. The Southern California Guinea Pig Rescue, which organized the intervention, is now seeking public assistance for adoptions, foster care, and donations to cover medical expenses. The group expressed concern over the initial assessment by city animal services, which reportedly deemed the animals healthy.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try victory over the US Eagles in a match held in Washington D.C. The game was significantly affected by challenging weather, including high humidity and two separate lightning delays that prolonged the event. Despite the interruptions, the English team, composed of mostly younger professionals, demonstrated superior precision and control throughout the contest. The final score was 38-5, with the US scoring a consolation try at the end of the match.</p>

This behavior highlights public frustration with the fees, which have been increased at more than half of the country's busiest airports in the last year.

However, the idea is less popular with teachers, who value the long break for rest and preparation.

          <p>A recent season of the Iowa Public Radio podcast "Unsettled" delves into the gender gap in contemporary American society, examining its effects on politics, education, and social norms. The series was inspired by the growing gender divide in voting patterns among young people, particularly after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. It also explores why boys are falling behind academically and how social media and the "manosphere" are influencing young men's perspectives. The podcast aims to understand the roots of these divides and what masculinity means in 2025.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who died after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing a fatal medical episode. The incident serves as a tragic reminder of the critical safety protocols required in MRI environments due to the strong magnetic forces involved.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are strongly considering a reunion with veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who played for the Clippers for six seasons and led the "Lob City" era, would bring additional playmaking and veteran leadership to the roster. The team is looking to build a competitive roster around its current stars, and Frank indicated that adding a player with Paul's qualities is a high priority. If signed, Paul would likely take on a reserve role.</p>

          <p>After years of growth, the popularity of learning Mandarin Chinese is reportedly waning in several Western nations, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. University enrollment in Mandarin courses in the U.S. has seen a significant drop from its peak in 2013, with similar downward trends observed in other countries. While once hailed as the language of the future due to China's economic rise, this shift suggests a change in geopolitical, economic, and cultural dynamics influencing language education choices in the Global North.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate a partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions to limit flights at Mexico City's main airport and move them to a newer, more distant one. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy claims these actions violate a bilateral trade agreement and unfairly benefit Mexican airlines. All Mexican carriers must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules, escalating a trade dispute between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a complex international arrangement, the U.S., El Salvador, and Venezuela conducted a large-scale prisoner swap. The deal involved moving 250 Venezuelans, who had been deported from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador, back to their home country of Venezuela. In exchange, Venezuela released 10 U.S. nationals it had imprisoned. This event highlights the Trump administration's controversial strategy of deporting migrants to third countries, raising questions about the legality and morality of using deportees as bargaining chips in foreign policy negotiations.</p>

          <p>An NPR correspondent's reporting from Florida reveals the on-the-ground impact of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies. The state is described as a "laboratory" for these policies, with a significant increase in detentions, often of individuals without criminal records, leading to widespread fear in immigrant communities. A major consequence has been family separation, where American-citizen children are left to fend for themselves after one or both parents are detained and deported. The article underscores the human cost of the nationwide deportation crackdown.</p>
