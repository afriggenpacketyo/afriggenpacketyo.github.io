          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation and hormone therapy in Philadelphia for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, according to his spokesperson. The diagnosis, made in May 2025, revealed the cancer had metastasized to the bone and was characterized by a high-risk Gleason score of 9. A person close to the former president stated that he is responding well to the treatment, which began several weeks ago. This health challenge follows a previous successful treatment for basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, during his time in office.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call described as "very productive," focusing on establishing peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy urged Trump to help broker an end to the war with Russia, referencing his role in Middle East agreements. The conversation also covered bolstering Ukraine's air defense following recent Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. This call signals a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who had a contentious public meeting earlier in the year but have since found common ground.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The supplement creatine, widely known for enhancing muscle growth and athletic performance, is gaining attention for a broader range of health benefits, including for the brain and heart. Experts note that it aids in producing ATP, the body's energy currency, which can support cognitive functions, memory, and recovery, particularly in older adults and vegetarians. Some studies also suggest potential benefits for heart health by supplying energy for contractions and improving outcomes after certain surgeries. While considered one of the safest supplements for most healthy individuals, those with pre-existing kidney conditions are advised to exercise caution.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States, viewing it as a strategic step to advance their careers and national team ambitions. Players like Patrick Yazbek of Nashville SC highlight the league's quality and increasing global profile, challenging the misconception in Australia that European leagues are the only viable overseas option. The MLS provides not only a high level of competition but also professional opportunities like full-time coaching roles that are less common in Australia's A-League. This trend reflects a shift in MLS's strategy, which now focuses on developing and selling talented young players.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BlackRock's head of equity ETFs, Jay Jacobs, has identified a significant trend where investors are moving away from traditional, broad technology sector funds into more specialized, thematic ETFs focused on artificial intelligence and blockchain. He notes that AI-specific funds, which include major players like Nvidia and Microsoft, offer more granular exposure to the entire AI ecosystem, from semiconductors to large language models. Similarly, there is strong enthusiasm for blockchain technology, with significant investor interest in products that track cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. This shift indicates a growing investor appetite for targeted exposure to potentially disruptive technological themes. (not investment advice)</p>

His lawyers also contend that statements Mangione made to law enforcement and evidence found in his backpack, including a gun, should be suppressed because he was not read his rights and the search was warrantless.

          <p>Scientists at Rosatom, Russia's state nuclear corporation, have developed a working prototype of a plasma propulsion engine that could significantly reduce travel time to Mars to as little as 30 days. The engine uses electromagnetism to accelerate a stream of ionized hydrogen plasma, generating a continuous, modest thrust that can achieve extremely high final velocities over time. Lab tests have shown particle speeds 25 times faster than traditional chemical rockets, and the system boasts high fuel efficiency, requiring a nuclear power source. This technology represents a major step toward making long-duration space missions safer by reducing astronauts' exposure to cosmic radiation.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: President Trump's Engagement with Combat Sports Reflects a Broader Political Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's frequent appearances at sporting events, particularly combat sports like UFC and wrestling, are part of a deliberate political strategy to project an image of machismo and strength. This article argues that Trump leverages the psychology of sports fandom, where allegiances feel like personal victories, to cultivate a brawling, "Ultimate Fighter" persona. His administration has deep ties to the UFC, and he plans to host a cage fight on the White House lawn, blurring the lines between entertainment and governance. This "MAGA-fication" of sports is seen as a tactic to weaken collective boundaries and normalize a more brutish, rule-breaking approach to politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its tenth day, with Senate Democrats holding firm on their demands and refusing to approve funding until Republicans agree to several concessions. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer stated that his party's position strengthens daily, prompting outrage from Republicans who accuse him of being callous as federal workers face layoffs. Democrats are leveraging their power to demand extensions for Affordable Care Act credits and a reversal of Medicaid cuts. The standoff has devolved into legislative trench warfare, with both sides blaming the other for the impasse and the resulting disruption to government services and federal employment.</p>

          <p>A Guardian opinion piece condemns Fox News host Jesse Watters for his on-air speculation that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "wants to sleep with" White House adviser Stephen Miller. The bizarre commentary came after Ocasio-Cortez mocked Miller's height in an Instagram video, urging people to laugh at MAGA figures. The article argues that while Ocasio-Cortez's joke about height was not clever, her point about using humor and mockery as a weapon against authoritarian figures is valid, as demonstrated by the thin-skinned and defensive reactions from Miller and other Trump allies. The columnist concludes that laughing at such figures is a necessary response to their actions.</p>

          <p>Archbishop Gregory Aymond of New Orleans testified under oath for the first time in the archdiocese's long-running bankruptcy case, which is tied to a proposed $230 million settlement for clergy abuse survivors. The deposition, held under a protective order, marks a significant development, as a previously scheduled testimony in 2020 was blocked when the archdiocese filed for bankruptcy. This filing halted 34 pending sexual abuse lawsuits against the church. The settlement is currently awaiting a vote from claimants, while the archdiocese's legal and professional fees in the bankruptcy case are expected to reach $55 million by December.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's cultivated image as a champion of the American worker, critics argue his administration's policies have worsened economic conditions for the working class. The ongoing government shutdown, which has led to mass firings of federal employees, is cited as a recent example of this disconnect. Analysts point to the administration's tax cuts, broad tariffs, and mass deportation agenda as actions that raise costs and drive down wages for ordinary people while benefiting corporations and the wealthy. While Trump employs the aesthetics of blue-collar solidarity, his policies on issues from trade to federal employment reveal a different reality.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a Palestinian-American writer grapples with "disenfranchised grief" after the death of her grandmother. Living safely in the U.S. while witnessing the immense suffering and mass casualties in Gaza, she feels her personal sorrow is indulgent and unearned compared to the collective atrocity her people are enduring. The author explores how social media's real-time broadcast of devastation recalibrates what feels worthy of mourning, creating a sense of guilt for her own heartbreak. She concludes that for Palestinians, the acts of cooking traditional foods and gathering family are acts of defiance and survival, a way to hold both personal and collective sorrow.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collection of articles from The Atlantic examines the nature of regret, framing it as an unavoidable emotional consequence of having free will. Instead of adhering to a "no regrets" philosophy, which can be counterproductive, the pieces suggest there is value in confronting feelings of disappointment or sadness about past decisions. By allowing oneself to experience regret, even for a short time, it is possible to learn more about one's present self and values. This approach transforms regret from a backward-looking refusal to accept the past into a tool for present-day self-discovery and future growth.</p>

The narratives highlight a wide range of journeys, from a man who waited 18 years to be fully honest with his parents to a woman who gradually revealed her queer identity by simply stop hiding it. Common themes emerge from their advice to others: the importance of finding a support system, extending grace to loved ones on their own journey of acceptance, and coming out only when it feels safe and right for the individual.

          <p>The race to become the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is shaping up to be a verdict on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's performance. The two main candidates, Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson, represent different approaches to the role: Powell, recently sacked from the cabinet, positions herself as a critical voice willing to push for a "course correction," while Phillipson, a current cabinet member, advocates for working firmly but quietly within the leadership structure. With many party members disgruntled with Starmer's leadership and the party's poor polling, the election of Powell, who is seen as the favorite, could be interpreted as a rebuke to the current Downing Street operation.</p>

          <p>The world is on track for a record grain harvest this year, highlighting a major human achievement: the dramatic reduction of famine caused by crop failure. Advances in agriculture, including improved seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and widespread irrigation, have tripled cereal yields since the 1960s, making food scarcity far rarer. However, hunger persists for billions who cannot afford a healthy diet. Modern famines, such as those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict that disrupt access to an otherwise abundant global food supply, rather than by natural shortages.</p>

          <p>Legal scholars and historians are warning that President Donald Trump and his allies are exploiting the recent killing of rightwing influencer Charlie Kirk to launch a broad, authoritarian campaign against their political opponents. In the month since the murder, the administration has initiated investigations into liberal donor George Soros, labeled critics the "enemy within," and threatened legal action against media figures. Experts describe this as a classic authoritarian tactic: using an act of violence as a pretext to attack civil society, silence dissent, and consolidate power by broadly defining any opposition as a threat to national security.</p>
