        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On a recent episode of her podcast, former First Lady Michelle Obama, alongside her husband Barack Obama, directly addressed and humorously dismissed persistent rumors about their divorce. She emphatically stated there has never been a moment she considered leaving him, reaffirming their commitment after 32 years of marriage. The former president's appearance marked his first on her new podcast, where they discussed the public's fascination with their relationship status, particularly when they make separate public appearances. Michelle Obama reiterated that marriage requires hard work but that she and Barack have built a strong partnership through both challenging and joyful times.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has called for an aggressive investigation into the killing of Sayfollah Musallat, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American citizen. Musallat was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank town of Sinjil. Initially met with a subdued U.S. response, the ambassador later condemned the incident as a "criminal and terrorist act," demanding accountability. Musallat's family states he was protecting his family's land from settlers and that an ambulance was blocked from reaching him, leading to his death before he could receive medical care.</p>

          <h2>New York Officials Criticize Tesla's New Bylaw Restricting Shareholder Lawsuits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 14:33:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York State officials are pressuring Tesla to reverse a recent change to its corporate bylaws that significantly restricts shareholders' ability to file derivative lawsuits. The new rule requires an investor to own at least 3% of the company's stock, currently valued at about $30 billion, to bring such a suit. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, a Tesla shareholder, accused the company of a "bait-and-switch," arguing Tesla misled investors when it moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas. Officials claim this move effectively insulates Tesla's leadership from accountability and violates principles of good corporate governance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has labeled the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation a "hoax" and "b--------," lashing out at his own supporters who are demanding the full release of government files. In a social media post, Trump claimed the issue is a Democratic "scam" and disavowed Republicans who have focused on it, calling them "weaklings." This comes amid growing pressure on his administration and Attorney General Pam Bondi to provide more transparency, with some conservatives calling for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress. When pressed by reporters, Trump insisted the matter was a hoax without providing evidence.</p>

          <p>American families have started their back-to-school shopping earlier than usual this year, driven by concerns over inflation and the potential impact of upcoming tariffs. A National Retail Federation survey found that two-thirds of shoppers are already buying supplies, with over half citing tariffs as a primary motivator for their early start. President Trump's announcement of steep new tariffs, effective August 1, has fueled fears of price hikes on imported goods like apparel and electronics. While overall family spending is projected to be slightly lower than last year, retailers like Walmart and Target are offering early sales to attract budget-conscious consumers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, just hours after reportedly asking Republican lawmakers for their approval to do so. The initial reports caused a brief dip in stock markets, which later recovered after Trump downplayed the threat. Despite calling Powell a "knucklehead" and criticizing his reluctance to lower interest rates, Trump said he was "not planning on doing anything." The president's repeated attacks on the Fed's independence have raised concerns about political interference in the central bank, which could destabilize a fragile global financial system already stressed by trade wars.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that consuming foods high in choline, an essential micronutrient, could significantly lower the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that a daily intake of about 350 milligrams of choline was associated with the lowest risk of a clinical Alzheimer's diagnosis in older adults. Choline is commonly found in foods such as poultry, eggs, dairy products, broccoli, and beans. Nutrition experts emphasize the importance of a brain-healthy diet, also recommending foods like walnuts, wild salmon, and leafy greens, which contain beneficial nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids alongside choline.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June indicated a 2.7% annual inflation rate, signaling an upward trend after a period of decline and meeting economists' forecasts. This increase, the highest since February, was driven by rising costs for food and energy, with food prices alone climbing 3% annually. Analysts suggest that new tariffs may be starting to contribute to the price hikes in categories like apparel and home furnishings. The latest data makes an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming July meeting highly unlikely, as the central bank continues to monitor inflationary pressures.

The rule, which was set to benefit approximately 15 million Americans carrying $49 billion in medical debt, was challenged by credit industry trade groups. The judge ruled that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

The conflict stems from Trump's desire for lower interest rates to offset the economic impact of his tariffs, a move Powell has resisted due to inflation concerns.

Because the Senate is amending the bill, it must be sent back to the House for another vote before a fast-approaching deadline.</p>

          <p>The 2025 MLB All-Star Game in Atlanta paid a memorable tribute to the late baseball legend Hank Aaron, who passed away in 2021. Using advanced technology, video, and audio clips, the event recreated the moment from 1974 when Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run, surpassing Babe Ruth. The tribute featured the original broadcast call from Vin Scully and traced Aaron's historic home run trot around the bases with lighted footprints on the field. The moment was especially significant as it celebrated a Black man breaking a major record in the Deep South, a point Scully highlighted in his original call.</p>

          <p>In a podcast discussion, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok warned that the agency is a fragile institution being systematically dismantled by politically motivated leaders like Director Kash Patel. Strzok argues that Trump's directive to shut down the Epstein investigation reveals a deep political fracture and highlights how loyalists are purging experts and sidelining critical national security functions. He asserts that reassigning experienced agents to other cities is a tool to force resignations, leaving the U.S. dangerously vulnerable to terrorism and foreign espionage. This hollowing out of expertise threatens the rule of law, which Strzok equates with the so-called "deep state."</p>

          <p>A surprising acceleration in the UK's inflation rate has created new uncertainty for the Bank of England, complicating its anticipated interest rate cut in August. After a period of slowing, inflation has quickened unexpectedly and is projected to remain above the bank's target until the autumn. This development has caused renewed caution among investors, who had previously considered an August rate cut from the current 4.25% to be almost certain. The Bank of England now faces the challenge of justifying a rate cut while managing current inflation, a weakening jobs market, and concerns about rising wage costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A chaotic surge for humanitarian aid at a distribution center in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, has left at least 20 people dead. The U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which runs the site, reported 19 people were trampled and one was stabbed, blaming armed individuals affiliated with Hamas for inciting the unrest. However, Hamas and local hospital officials dispute this, with the hospital reporting 21 deaths from suffocation and a crush, and witnesses claiming security contractors caused the panic. This tragic incident highlights the desperation and breakdown of order at aid sites amid a severe shortage of assistance in Gaza.</p>

This examination was ordered by India's aviation regulator following a preliminary investigation into last month's deadly Air India crash, which killed 260 people. The initial crash report found that the fuel switches on the doomed aircraft had flipped from the "run" to "cutoff" position almost simultaneously shortly after takeoff, causing the plane to lose thrust. The investigation into the exact cause of the catastrophic failure and the crash itself is still ongoing.</p>

          <p>A former New York City police commissioner, Tom Donlon, has filed a lawsuit against the city, Mayor Eric Adams, and other top officials, alleging a "coordinated criminal enterprise" within the government. In the 251-page claim, Donlon asserts that during his brief tenure, he uncovered systemic corruption but was sidelined by Adams after attempting to establish internal oversight. He also claims the NYPD falsely arrested his wife in an act of retaliation and leaked the incident to the press. This lawsuit is one of several recent claims from former officials alleging corruption and malfeasance at the highest levels of the NYPD and city government.</p>
