        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to announce a significant compromise on its proposed welfare reforms following pressure from over 100 of its own backbenchers. According to multiple sources, the deal will protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit from cuts. This climbdown addresses major concerns raised by Labour MPs regarding the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, which aims to save £5bn annually by 2030. The government had faced a potential defeat in the House of Commons without these concessions.</p>

          <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has made its first confirmed discovery of a planet outside our solar system, an exoplanet designated TWA 7b. Orbiting a young star, this planet is estimated to be about the mass of Saturn and is located approximately 50 times farther from its star than Earth is from the Sun. Scientists utilized a technique called high-contrast imaging, using a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and reveal the faint planet. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, evidence strongly indicates it is a previously undiscovered planet.</p>

          <p>During a live ESPN interview at the 2025 NBA Draft, the mother of first-round pick Danny Wolf mistakenly said she was excited for her son to go to New York. Wolf, who was selected 27th overall by the Brooklyn Nets, was seen gently mouthing "Brooklyn" to correct her, a polite clarification to distinguish from their rivals, the New York Knicks. The heartwarming moment occurred on a busy night for the Nets, who acquired five new players in the first round of the draft. Wolf, a forward from Michigan, was celebrated for his accomplishment amidst the harmless family flub.</p>

          <p>A California state appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a former top adviser to ex-L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón, in a sharp rebuke to the state attorney general's prosecution. Teran was accused of improperly downloading and using confidential police records, but her defense successfully argued the documents were publicly available court records. The court's unanimous ruling affirmed that her actions were not criminal, as the information was accessible to the public. This decision concludes a politically charged case that critics alleged was a misuse of prosecutorial resources against a public servant focused on police accountability.</p>

Key provisions, including a plan to cut Medicaid funding to pay for new spending, have been ruled non-compliant with Senate budget rules.

The concert covered his entire catalog, from his early gothic R&B to his massive pop hits like "Blinding Lights," showcasing his unique vocal talent and stagecraft.

Khamenei also threatened future retaliation against U.S. bases if attacked again.

Senators like Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated they believe significant capabilities remain and that the president may have deliberately misled the public about the extent of the damage. They argue the setback to Iran's program is likely a matter of months, not years, as you cannot eliminate knowledge.

Despite the steep drop, Nike's finance chief confirmed this quarter represents the financial low point, with headwinds expected to moderate.

However, this article advises caution before applying, suggesting three preliminary steps.

          <p>Six individuals were taken into police custody during a protest that blocked the entrance to Palantir's New York office on Thursday. The demonstration, organized by the group Planet Over Profit, was in opposition to the tech company's contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli military. Protesters voiced objections to Palantir's technology being used for deportations, military operations in Gaza, and expanded surveillance. Palantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has previously expressed public support for Israel, acknowledging it has caused some employees to leave the company.</p>

In a statement, Child Q described the ongoing trauma, saying she doesn't know if she will "feel normal again."

Top intelligence officials also released statements supporting President Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear facilities were "destroyed."

          <p>The sequel "M3GAN 2.0" expands its universe by leaning more into action-comedy than the horror of its predecessor, introducing a new military-grade android named AMELIA. The film sees the original M3GAN doll reconstructed while her creator, Gemma (Allison Williams), ironically becomes an anti-technology crusader. The plot follows a familiar AI-takeover narrative, with the two femmebots eventually clashing, but is elevated by director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor. While the movie offers flashy, B-movie fun, its most intriguing moments are the strange and unpredictable human interactions that surround the central robot conflict.</p>

A small fragment, believed to be a meteorite, reportedly crashed through the roof of a home in Henry county, piercing the floor. The National Weather Service confirmed it detected a smoke trail on its satellite imagery, although the event was too high to be caught on its primary radar. The unusual midday event was witnessed by numerous people who captured images and videos of the fireball's descent.</p>

          <p>Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin delivered a sharp critique of her own party, stating that Democrats act like "a solar system with no sun" and fail to work as a team. In a speech at a Washington D.C. thinktank, the former CIA analyst urged her colleagues to "slaughter some sacred cows" to effectively combat Donald Trump and regain public trust. She criticized Democrats for being scared to enforce immigration rules and for taking an "elitist" approach to climate change, advocating for a pragmatic focus on the economy, jobs, and housing to address the shrinking middle class.</p>

          <h2>Proposed $5 Million 'Trump Card' for Immigrants Faces Significant Legal and Market Hurdles</h2>

          <p>President Trump's proposed "Trump Card," an immigration plan offering residency for a $5 million investment, is facing major legal challenges and questions about its market viability. Immigration attorneys note that the plan would require congressional approval to alter the existing EB-5 visa program and, most contentiously, to change U.S. tax law to exempt cardholders from taxes on worldwide income. While the administration touts high interest, experts suggest the actual market is much smaller than projected and that demand will depend heavily on resolving these complex tax and legal issues.

          <p>Shares of the recently-listed stablecoin issuer Circle resumed their rally Thursday, gaining 7% after a brief pullback. The volatility and growing awareness of Circle's business model, which involves earning interest on reserves backing its USDC stablecoin, appear to be positively impacting its main distribution partner, Coinbase. Coinbase stock also gained over 5%, as investors recognize its potential benefits from the expanding stablecoin market. The market is closely watching potential Fed rate cuts, which could affect Circle's earnings, and progress on U.S. stablecoin regulation. (not investment advice)</p>
