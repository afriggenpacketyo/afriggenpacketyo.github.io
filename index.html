Shenzhen and Xiamen have been added to the C919's route map, bringing the total number of mainland cities served to 15; the airliner also operates a daily cross-border service between Shanghai and Hong Kong. China aims to secure more orders for the C919, positioning it as a rival to established aviation giants like Boeing and Airbus.

          <p>A new report by ICF forecasts a dramatic surge in electricity demand in the United States, potentially rising by 78% by 2050, which could strain the reliability and affordability of the power grid. This increase is attributed to factors like rising temperatures, emerging technologies such as cryptocurrency mining, data centers, and the adoption of electric vehicles. Retail electricity costs are also expected to double by 2050, with a projected 6% jump in 2025, costing households an average of $784 during the summer period. Grid operators are already warning of high peak demand during the summer months, urging consumers to prepare for potential challenges.</p>

          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month, reflecting the impact of U.S. tariffs on its economy. Exports grew by only 2%, the slowest pace since October of the previous year, while imports shrank by 2.2%. Automobiles, a key export to the U.S., account for a significant portion of Japan's shipments. The trade deficit narrowed to 115.8 billion yen, but exports to major trading partners like China and the U.S. have declined. These figures highlight the challenges Japan faces amid ongoing trade tensions and their effects on economic growth.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed his chief spokesman to lead a review of the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, aiming to ensure accountability among senior military officials. The review will be conducted by Sean Parnell, the Pentagonâ€™s assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, and former Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller, who criticized military leaders after the Kabul airport bombing. Hegseth has largely blamed the Biden administration for the chaotic withdrawal, suggesting that military leaders should have resigned in protest. The review's scope will likely exclude broader decisions leading up to the withdrawal, including the Trump administration's deal with the Taliban.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto has resigned as Japan's farm minister following controversy over his comment that he doesn't buy rice because he receives it from supporters, a remark that sparked outrage as rice prices have doubled.

Eto's resignation comes shortly after the agriculture ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to curb rising prices.

The suspect, 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, was killed in the explosion, and four others were injured. Investigators are piecing together the events leading up to the bombing, with evidence suggesting Bartkus acted alone but held strong views against bringing people into the world against their will.

The woman's attorney argues that she is eligible for U.S. residency due to her long-term residence and U.S. citizen children. This case marks a significant enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, with the attorney noting an increase in ICE fines issued to clients remaining in the country illegally. The attorney plans to appeal the fine, arguing that the woman was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles' signature play, the 'tush push,' is under scrutiny and may be banned by the NFL due to safety concerns. The Packers have proposed a ban, citing player safety and pace of play. While some coaches express worries about injury risks, NFL executives note that data does not support safety concerns due to the play's infrequent nature. Some argue that the play, similar to a scrum in rugby, does not belong in football, raising questions about its future in the league.</p>

          <p>The trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs has brought forth testimonies involving rap rivalries, sexual performances, and illegally defaced assault weapons. Witnesses, including Combs' former assistant and a sex worker, have testified about alleged encounters and activities. Combs' ex-girlfriend's mother testified about Combs blackmailing her daughter. Prosecutors are building a racketeering and sex trafficking case against Combs, who has pleaded not guilty, with his lawyers arguing that his private conduct does not amount to sexual assault. The trial continues with more witnesses expected to testify.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will not force Medicaid to cover GLP-1 drugs for obesity, despite their potential benefits, citing cost concerns. However, some states, like South Carolina, have decided to cover these weight loss drugs, albeit with stringent prerequisites. The decision impacts millions of patients who could benefit from these medications, but access remains limited due to high costs and rigorous approval processes. The FDA is also considering removing less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs from the market, further restricting access for those in need.</p>

          <p>NHS England will launch a world-first gonorrhoea vaccination program in August, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or STIs, as infections have reached record levels. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea. This initiative aims to reduce the pressure on clinics and prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria. The program will be offered through sexual health services, with Public Health Scotland also planning a similar launch for high-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to urge support for a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from dueling factions. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts, while moderates oppose larger cuts to Medicaid and demand changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). Trump emphasized the need for unity and warned against divisions over SALT and Medicaid, except for addressing waste, fraud, and abuse. Despite the challenges, House Speaker Mike Johnson remains confident in securing passage of the bill.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that red meat studies with industry links are more likely to report favorable results than those without them, raising concerns about potential bias in nutrition research. The review found that industry-funded trials often neglect to compare red meat to heart-healthy alternatives like whole grains and plant-based proteins. Experts suggest that this can undermine nutrition science and confuse consumers about the health consequences of their dietary choices. The findings underscore the need for more independent research to ensure unbiased information about the health effects of red meat.</p>

          <p>A temporary truce between the US and China on tariffs has eased concerns about a damaging trade decoupling. The Geneva negotiations yielded better-than-expected results, boosting confidence in financial markets. While the scaled-back tariffs still impact bilateral trade, the agreement suggests that neither side wants to sever economic ties completely. There is cautious optimism that further tariff reductions are possible after the 90-day period, as most expect tariffs to either hold steady or decrease further.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter, yet shares fell in extended trading, possibly because the company did not raise its full-year outlook for key metrics. Despite the stock's drop, analysts believe the cybersecurity company is well-positioned for future growth, driven by its next-generation security suite, particularly its AI-powered Cortex XSIAM. The company's platformization strategy, aimed at getting customers to consolidate their cybersecurity spending, is showing momentum. Cybersecurity spending remains resilient, and the company has several trends going its way, consolidation, the elevated threat environment, bad actors becoming more sophisticated, data proliferation, and artificial intelligence.
