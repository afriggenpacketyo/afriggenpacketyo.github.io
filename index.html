          <p>Since President Trump's return to power, the administration has terminated thousands of federal workers, leading to court-ordered reinstatements and subsequent legal challenges. Probationary workers, who generally have less than a year in their roles, have been particularly affected, facing a state of limbo with whiplashing court orders. The administration's actions have drawn criticism, with a federal judge calling the suggestion that the dismissals were performance-related a 'total sham'. Concerns are growing about the loss of scientific and technical expertise and the demoralization of the federal workforce.</p>

He attributed the 'bad parts' of the economy to former President Joe Biden while taking credit for the 'good parts'.

          <p>Residents of a Texas town voted to rename it 'Starbase' after Elon Musk's SpaceX company.

Critics have voiced concerns over the environmental impact and the potential for increased 'destruction'.

Lau, who fled Hong Kong five years ago, spoke out against the construction of the 5.5-acre complex near Tower Bridge, arguing it sends the 'wrong message' that Britain welcomes authoritarian regimes. Within 48 hours, her elderly aunt and uncle were arrested and questioned in Hong Kong, followed by another aunt a week later. Lau believes the harassment is an attempt to stop her 'anti-Chinese' activities in the UK.</p>

The proposed budget plan also includes cuts in support to public broadcasters and conforms to efforts by the president during his first term to see government support of the arts and humanities endowments eliminated.
