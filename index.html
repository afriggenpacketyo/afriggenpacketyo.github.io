          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 20:11:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While international tourism to the United States has decreased, American citizens are increasingly traveling abroad, creating a significant imbalance in the global travel industry. Data indicates a nearly 10% drop in foreign visitors arriving by air in March compared to the previous year, while outbound travel by Americans increased by 1.6%. This trend is influenced by factors such as trade tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar, deterring international travelers. Conversely, Americans are motivated by graduation trips and television shows, leading to increased international bookings, particularly among wealthier retirees seeking new experiences before it's too late.

          <p>The Trump administration's move to reduce funding for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has led to significant job losses affecting nearly 20,000 employees across 46 states. The cuts have impacted numerous organizations and universities that rely on USAID funding for foreign aid programs and research. Workers outside of Washington, D.C., are particularly affected, facing challenges in accessing unemployment resources and finding alternative employment in their fields. Many are now seeking work in the private sector or considering leaving the formal job market altogether due to the limited opportunities available.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed executive orders targeting universities, seeking to reshape higher education institutions by cracking down on diversity and inclusion efforts. The actions address foreign gifts to universities, college accreditation, and workforce development, directing the federal government to enforce laws related to the disclosure of large donations. The administration alleges that accreditors have imposed "discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-based standards," violating federal law and abusing their authority. Despite condemning diversity and inclusion efforts, Trump also signed an order establishing a White House initiative on historically black colleges and universities.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a plan to phase out eight synthetic food dyes in the American food supply, citing potential links to behavioral issues and cancer. The FDA will work with manufacturers to replace these dyes with natural alternatives like watermelon and carrot juice. Studies have suggested that artificial food colors may affect children's behavior and exacerbate symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

The US administration's vision involves freezing territorial lines close to their current positions, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to make concessions, though specifics on geographic concessions remain unclear.
