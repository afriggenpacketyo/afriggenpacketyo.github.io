          <p>Scammers are leveraging artificial intelligence to create fake profiles and apply for remote job postings, raising concerns about identity theft and data breaches. AI can be used to generate fake resumes, headshots, websites, and LinkedIn profiles, making it difficult to distinguish fraudulent applicants. Gartner estimates that one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028. Experts recommend in-person interviews and cultural questions to verify the authenticity of candidates.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines warned that softer travel demand will impact earnings in the second quarter, with bookings having stabilized but still forecasting a six-percentage-point headwind. The carrier expects second-quarter unit revenue to be flat to down as much as 6% and anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.65, lower than analysts' forecasts. Citing "economic uncertainty and volatility," the airline said it wouldn't update its full-year guidance.</p>

The current collective bargaining agreement expires after the 2026 season. Top of the agenda for owners in negotiations will be the creative spending of deep-pocket teams such as the Dodgers and Mets.</p>
