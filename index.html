          <p>President Trump, aboard Air Force One, discussed his administration's judicial nominations, emphasizing the need for judges who won't demand trials for every illegal immigrant. He stated that the overhaul of U.S. immigration policies was his "No. 1 issue" during the campaign, and claimed that judges are delaying the process. Trump expressed concern over the time required for trials for every criminal, stating he doesn't believe the Supreme Court will stand for it, because if they do, the country will be lost. This comes amidst ongoing debates about due process and immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios and streaming services, including Netflix, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery, experienced a decline following President Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Trump cited tax incentives offered by foreign countries as a national security threat, authorizing the Department of Commerce to impose a levy on films produced abroad and sent to the United States. The industry worries about the impact on relationships with other countries, as Hollywood relies on international box office sales to recoup film budgets.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over whether to repeal Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are crucial for some of their constituents. In Noatak, Alaska, a village is trying to build a solar farm to reduce reliance on expensive diesel fuel. However, uncertainty over the tax credits' future has stalled the project, with a major solar farm builder pulling out. Senator Lisa Murkowski is advocating to preserve the tax credits, while other Republicans seek to eliminate them to fund President Trump's agenda.</p>
