          <p>Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill stated that the two remaining inmates from the recent New Orleans jail escape may have fled to other cities, making it harder for them to remain unnoticed due to the high-profile nature of the case. Murrill expressed confidence that the escapees will eventually be apprehended, emphasizing that they cannot hide indefinitely. Investigations into the escape, which Louisiana's governor called the worst in recent state history, are ongoing, with multiple arrests made in connection to the incident. Murrill cited issues such as the slow-moving court system and jail staffing as contributing factors to the escape, also noting that a significant number of security cameras were not functioning at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>A federal court panel has ruled that President Trump's large-scale tariffs exceeded his legal authority, effectively freezing their implementation. The court blocked the 10% tariffs imposed on numerous U.S. trading partners, as well as separate tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, which were justified by the Trump administration due to concerns about drug trafficking and illegal immigration. The court rejected the administration's reliance on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), stating that Congress did not grant the president blanket authority to set tariffs. The Trump administration has signaled its intention to appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, dealing a blow to a key part of his economic policies, prompting an immediate appeal from the Trump administration. The court stated that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's authority to safeguard the economy. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), invoked by the White House, does not provide unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of small businesses affected by the duties.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to expanding its advanced manufacturing capabilities, potentially setting the stage for conflict with President Trump's trade agenda. Trump seeks to boost domestic production of high-tech products and address trade imbalances with China, while Xi emphasizes self-reliance in manufacturing. Experts suggest that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to its goal of self-reliance. China's "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform the country into a leading high-end manufacturer, but it has faced criticism for distorting competition and missing key targets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pedestrian deaths have surged in recent years, partly due to the increasing size and weight of vehicles like SUVs and trucks, which create large blind zones and require longer braking distances. The average passenger vehicle has become significantly heavier and taller over the past three decades, exacerbating the danger to pedestrians, especially small children. Automakers have begun repositioning front cameras lower to help drivers see pedestrians, but this change comes too late for families who have already experienced loss. The family of a young boy killed by a pickup truck is advocating for changes to technology and increased awareness to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a major tenet of the president's economic agenda. The judges wrote that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law invoked by Trump, does not grant the president the power to implement the sweeping duties initiated last month. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, arguing that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has fueled America's historic trade deficits.

The cancellation comes despite Moderna's claims of positive interim results from a study involving healthy adults.

          <p>Kennett, Missouri, a town that overwhelmingly supported President Trump, is now grappling with the impending deportation of Carol Hui, a longtime resident from Hong Kong. Hui, who has lived in Kennett for 20 years, is facing deportation for overstaying her tourist visa, despite her strong ties to the community. The case has sparked debate among residents, with some questioning how to reconcile support for Trump's immigration policies with the impact on a beloved community member. Supporters have organized fundraisers and prayer vigils to support Hui and her family.</p>

Investors are pricing in increased concerns around the unresolved debt ceiling, with CDS contracts acting as a hedge against political risk rather than insolvency. The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a major tax cut package which could reportedly see the debt ceiling raised by $4 trillion, pending approval from the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is increasingly using his clemency powers to pardon allies and supporters who claim they were unfairly targeted by prosecutors for political reasons.

This has created an incentive for pardon seekers to demonstrate their loyalty to Trump and accuse the Biden Justice Department of political bias.</p>
