            <p>The Trump administration is threatening to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing concerns over campus antisemitism and discrimination. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warned Harvard that its certification to accept foreign students is contingent upon compliance with federal immigration rules. Noem alleged that Harvard has created a hostile learning environment for Jewish students due to its failure to condemn antisemitism. The Department of Homeland Security also canceled two grants to Harvard totaling $2.7 million, deeming the school unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars.</p>

States are responding differently, with some questioning the order's legality and others aligning with the administration's interpretation. The order has created confusion and anxiety among educators, who fear investigations and are being cautious in their teaching approaches.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that Google possesses an illegal monopoly in the online advertising technology market. The Department of Justice and 17 states sued Google, alleging it illegally dominates the technology used to determine online ad placement. This marks Google's second antitrust case loss in a year, following a ruling that it also monopolizes online search. Google intends to appeal the decision, arguing its ad tech tools are effective and offer publishers numerous options.

            <p>Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of Truth Social, has requested market regulators to investigate "suspicious activity" related to a London-based hedge fund's short position against its stock.

            <p>Small business owners are increasingly worried about mounting economic uncertainty, largely driven by President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. They fear that this instability could lead to business closures. The unpredictability makes strategic planning difficult and dampens consumer spending. The cost of unpredictability, especially for businesses relying on imported goods, is proving detrimental to their confidence and ability to invest in growth.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war and tariffs on Chinese imports threaten to raise prices and create shortages for everyday electronics. Many common household items, such as toasters and hair curlers, are almost entirely imported from China. The US lacks the manufacturing ecosystem to quickly replace these imports. While the secondary market for refurbished electronics may see a boost, tariffs on components could also impact prices there. The article highlights the potential for shortages, inflation, and fewer product options.</p>
