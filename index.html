          <p>New Jersey Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver has been charged with assault following a confrontation with officers outside an ICE detention center in Newark. The incident occurred during an oversight visit by Democratic lawmakers, who were initially denied entry. Videos of the event show heated discussions and a chaotic scene involving police, ICE agents, journalists, and protesters. McIver denies any wrongdoing, calling the charges "purely political," while other Democrats condemn the charges as extreme and baseless. Alina Habba, the interim US attorney, is dropping a trespassing case against Newark's mayor, Ras Baraka, and offered to give him a personal tour of the facility.</p>

          <p>Chinese investments in Europe experienced a 47% surge in 2024, marking the first increase in nine years, with Hungary solidifying its position as a leading hub for Chinese capital. This rise comes after a period of decline following increased scrutiny from European governments over Chinese acquisitions of critical technology firms. Greenfield investments, where Chinese companies launch new ventures by constructing facilities, rose by 21%, while mergers and acquisitions jumped by 114%. The report highlights that over half of China's investments in high-income economies were directed towards Europe, signaling a shift amid challenges in other markets like the US.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te is entering his second year in office facing increasing political challenges both domestically and internationally. Despite efforts to strengthen military readiness and increase defense spending, the White House has given a lukewarm response, and the island's youth are less inclined to join the armed forces. The US-China trade negotiations have highlighted a sobering reality for Lai's administration, as even Washington is willing to strike deals with Beijing that leave Taipei on the sidelines. Lai is also faced with an opposition-controlled legislature that has blocked some of his key initiatives.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of young people are becoming addicted to nicotine pouches, initially used as an alternative to vaping. These pouches, which are unregulated in the UK, contain high levels of nicotine and are easily accessible to teenagers. Health experts are raising concerns about their addictive nature and potential harmful side effects, particularly for oral health. Some fear that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes may drive more young people to use these stronger nicotine products, which are marketed towards young people on social media and sometimes given away at railway stations.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's recent announcement of his prostate cancer diagnosis has reignited questions about his health during his time in the White House. While his office stated that he received the diagnosis after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms, some are surprised it wasn't detected earlier. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have suggested a lack of transparency regarding Biden's health, a claim refuted by a Biden aide who noted his last PSA test was in 2014, following medical guidelines. The diagnosis comes amidst reports that his aides sought to conceal other health conditions ahead of the 2024 election, raising concerns about his fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee was forced to rob a bank in 2000 to save her 7-year-old daughter, Breea, after they were kidnapped and threatened with dynamite. Three masked gunmen broke into their home, bound them, and demanded Renee rob her bank, threatening to detonate explosives strapped to them. Renee complied, stealing $360,000, and returned home to find her daughter safe. The dynamite was later found to be fake, and the perpetrators were eventually caught, though the legal proceedings were complex and initially resulted in one suspect's acquittal before later revelations.</p>

          <p>As negotiations between Iran and the United States progress, the potential for US investment in Iran after sanctions are lifted presents a complex geopolitical challenge. While Iran is cautiously open to US investors, it insists on complete sanctions relief and safeguards against economic espionage. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has signaled that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei does not oppose US investment. If a nuclear framework stabilizes, phased US investment mediated by Gulf states could become a possibility, but any significant economic opening would require US Congressional approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump seems to be abandoning a European effort to impose new sanctions on Russia, signaling a shift towards prioritizing business deals with Moscow. After a call with Vladimir Putin, Trump has indicated that Russia and Ukraine must resolve the war themselves, distancing the U.S. from the peace process. This move has created a rift with European allies who intend to proceed with sanctions, and it leaves Putin with reduced American pressure and a divided NATO. While existing sanctions and intelligence sharing with Ukraine remain, Trump's focus appears to be on normalizing relations and pursuing economic opportunities with Russia.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer that has spread to his bones has sparked questions about the disease's progression and screening practices. While Biden's spokesperson stated that the diagnosis was recent, the aggressive nature of the cancer has raised concerns about how long it may have been developing. Experts note that prostate cancer screenings are not routinely recommended for men over 70, and Biden's last PSA test was in 2014. This situation underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual and the potential for aggressive cancers to develop rapidly, even with prior screenings.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing challenges in passing President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act," which encompasses a range of campaign promises from taxes to border security. The bill proposes significant changes, including potential Medicaid coverage losses for over 8 million recipients, SNAP food assistance cuts of $230 billion over 10 years, and the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. It also includes funding for border wall construction, increased defense spending, and the creation of MAGA savings accounts for children.
