        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk reported positive late-stage trial results for its oral obesity treatment, a pill version of its popular Wegovy injection. The trial showed patients achieved an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks, with a safety profile comparable to the injectable form. The company stated this offers patients a significant alternative, especially for those with an aversion to needles, and an FDA decision on the new drug is expected in the fourth quarter. The results position Novo Nordisk strongly in the competitive market for oral weight-loss drugs, particularly against rival Eli Lilly's Orforglipron.</p>

          <p>The British government plans to appeal a High Court decision that temporarily blocked the deportation of an Eritrean migrant to France under a new "one in, one out" agreement. The man's removal was halted after he made a last-minute claim of being a victim of modern slavery. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood criticized these actions as attempts to misuse the system and undermine efforts to deter small boat crossings. However, the UK's anti-slavery commissioner expressed deep concern over the Home Secretary's rhetoric, stating it could endanger vulnerable individuals and that there is no evidence of systemic abuse.</p>

          <p>During a regional security conference, China's Defense Minister Dong Jun urged nations to stand against what he described as Western "bullying" and disguised hegemonic logic. Without naming specific countries, he criticized military alliances and political blocs as "small, exclusive groups that serve hegemonic and selfish interests." His remarks, which framed China as a defender of the post-war order, appeared to find a receptive audience among some defense chiefs from Southeast Asia, who also voiced concerns about unilateral actions and called for stronger multilateralism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a slight decrease in overall fearfulness, the rising cost of living continues to be the primary concern for people in Germany, according to an annual study by R+V Versicherung. Inflation and worries about finances, including tax increases and unaffordable housing, dominate the list of public anxieties. The fear of being overwhelmed by an influx of refugees ranked second, particularly in eastern Germany. The study also noted significant dissatisfaction with politicians and a growing concern about the rise of authoritarian leaders worldwide, likely influenced by Donald Trump's second term as U.S. President.</p>

The reigning World Player of the Year's inclusion is a major boost, adding significant pace and attacking threat to the team. Other key selections include Hannah Botterman returning at prop and Zoe Harrison being preferred at fly-half for her game management skills.

          <p>Concerns are escalating over the political independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve following President Trump's persistent public demands for interest rate cuts and his appointment of administration insiders to the central bank's board. The confirmation of White House economic adviser Stephen Miran as a Fed governor, who immediately voted for a deeper rate cut than his colleagues, has intensified fears of political interference. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has insisted the institution's decisions remain based on economic data, but the administration's actions are seen as a significant test of the central bank's long-held autonomy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in the government's antitrust case against Google has attempted to address the company's monopoly in internet search without stifling its ability to compete in the emerging field of artificial intelligence. The penalties bar Google from making exclusive deals to be the default search engine but stop short of forcing a divestment of its Chrome browser. While Google must share some search data, critics worry the remedies are insufficient, as the company's vast data advantage from search could still allow it to dominate the AI landscape.

While Tennessee's Republican governor supports the move, the city's Democratic mayor has expressed dismay, stating he did not request the troops.

          <p>The price of ground beef in the U.S. has surged 51% since 2020, reaching historic highs due to the smallest national cattle herd in 75 years. A combination of drought, which forced ranchers to cull herds in 2022, and high operational costs have constrained supply. While demand remained strong for years, recent data indicates consumers are finally beginning to resist the high prices, with spending on ground beef plateauing for the first time. Restaurants are also feeling the pressure, forced to either raise menu prices or consider removing popular items like brisket.</p>

Russian media has attempted to blame Ukraine, Iran has pointed to Israel, and Chinese outlets have used the shooting to portray the U.S. as divided and chaotic.

Researchers of online extremism argue this suggests a "performative" act of violence, where the alleged shooter was emulating the culture of other high-profile killers and seeking to generate discourse, rather than acting from a coherent political ideology.

          <p>Wall Street strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat has predicted that Bitcoin could surge to a price of $200,000 by the end of the year. The primary catalyst for this bullish forecast is the anticipation of multiple interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as cryptocurrencies are historically sensitive to changes in monetary policy. Lee suggests that as the Fed begins its easing program, money will flow rapidly into riskier assets like Bitcoin. However, online prediction markets are more conservative, giving a higher probability to Bitcoin reaching $125,000 or $150,000 rather than the $200,000 target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lieutenant General He Lei, a former high-ranking official at a People's Liberation Army academy, has stated that mainland China would not need its most advanced weaponry to resolve the Taiwan issue by force. He asserted that conventional weapons would be sufficient to achieve victory with minimal cost and casualties if non-peaceful means became necessary. His comments emphasize the PLA's focus on overall combat capabilities, joint operations, and system-based warfare rather than a direct weapon-for-weapon comparison. This statement underscores Beijing's military confidence regarding its ability to control the situation across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has unveiled new AI computing systems powered by its in-house Ascend chips, directly challenging U.S. competitor Nvidia. The company plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, which will utilize over 500,000 Ascend chips to overcome U.S. sanctions restricting access to advanced semiconductors. Huawei claims its new system will deliver significantly more computing power than Nvidia's planned offerings, signaling a major push for self-reliance in China's critical chip technology sector. The announcement reflects the country's strategy of grouping large numbers of homegrown chips to achieve world-class AI capabilities.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the changing political landscape in Britain one year after the author moved from the U.S. to escape the divisiveness of the MAGA movement. The author expresses shock at the rapid rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party and the recent march organized by Tommy Robinson, drawing parallels to the political anger that fueled Donald Trump's ascent. While noting key differences, such as the lack of a powerful evangelical Christian base in the UK, the author questions how long Britain will remain a sanctuary from the populist, right-wing fervor that has gripped the United States.</p>

The case has sparked significant concern and evoked the state's dark history of racist violence, leading to calls from U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson for the FBI to get involved in the investigation.</p>
