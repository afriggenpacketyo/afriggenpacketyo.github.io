          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have detected a candidate gas giant planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest sun-like star to Earth. This discovery is notable because the fictional world of Pandora from the "Avatar" movies is set in this same star system. The planet appears to be in the star's habitable zone, where temperatures could potentially support life, leading to speculation about the possibility of life-sustaining moons. However, scientists emphasize that the planet's existence still requires further confirmation through additional observations.</p>

          <p>Seniors navigating retirement are assessing various financial tools to manage rising costs and ensure long-term stability. Social Security provides a foundational income but is often insufficient on its own, making supplementary strategies necessary. Annuities offer a guaranteed income stream, similar to a personal pension, which can provide peace of mind for those fearing they might outlive their savings. Meanwhile, reverse mortgages allow house-rich, cash-poor seniors to tap into their home equity, though this option reduces the value of their estate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's stock fell after its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, showed more modest weight loss results than some analysts had anticipated in a late-stage trial. The highest dose resulted in nearly 12% weight loss, which is below the 15% some had hoped for and slightly less than competitor Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy. While some doctors praised the results as a significant step for an oral treatment, others noted the high discontinuation rate due to side effects. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threats to impose steep secondary tariffs on countries like India and China for purchasing Russian energy exports. Traders seem to view the threats, including a 25% tariff on India, as a negotiating tactic rather than a policy that will be fully implemented. Analysts suggest that if the tariffs were enforced, they would significantly disrupt global supply and cause prices to spike, which would contradict Trump's goal of lowering energy costs. The market's calm response indicates a belief that a deal will be reached or that the administration will ultimately back down. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawmakers fled to prevent a quorum, thereby blocking a vote on a GOP-led redistricting plan that could significantly benefit Republicans in upcoming elections. Cornyn characterized the Democrats' actions as irresponsible and a political stunt, while Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state authorities to arrest the lawmakers upon their return.

          <p>Peloton surprised investors by posting a profitable fiscal fourth quarter, driven by cost-cutting measures and better-than-expected sales. Under new CEO Peter Stern, the company plans to reduce expenses by an additional $100 million, which will involve laying off 6% of its global workforce. This move follows previous efforts to stabilize the business after its pandemic-era boom. The company's full-year guidance suggests a path to revenue growth, although it faces headwinds from new tariffs on imported goods. Peloton is also shifting its retail strategy towards smaller "micro-stores" and expanding its wellness offerings beyond fitness equipment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent wave of tariffs, initially seen as chaotic, appears to follow a transactional negotiating strategy. The approach involves imposing high tariffs to pressure countries into making concessions, such as commitments to buy more U.S. goods or make investments. Nations that offer satisfactory deals, like the EU and Japan, face lower 15% tariffs, while others that don't, or that have angered the administration, are hit with much higher rates. However, this strategy is fraught with legal and economic uncertainty, as the tariffs face court challenges and contribute to fears of a slowing U.S. economy.</p>

The move comes as Texas Democrats have fled their state to block a similar redistricting attempt there.

          <p>Despite broad opposition, President Trump's tariffs have found support from some labor unions, such as the United Auto Workers (UAW). This backing stems from a long-held union belief that protectionist policies are necessary to combat the job losses caused by free-trade agreements like NAFTA, which decimated the U.S. manufacturing base. However, this creates a dilemma, as economists widely agree that broad tariffs are likely to harm the economy and the working-class consumers that unions represent. This article explores the complex position of unions caught between their historical opposition to free trade and the potentially damaging reality of Trump's specific tariff policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's controversial tariffs could become a lasting feature of U.S. fiscal policy, regardless of their economic impact or unpopularity. The primary reason is the substantial revenue they generate for the government, estimated at over $152 billion so far this year and potentially trillions over the next decade. As the U.S. faces growing deficits from an aging population and congressional aversion to raising other taxes, future presidents may be reluctant to repeal the tariffs and worsen the fiscal hole. This effectively creates a large tax increase without a congressional vote, potentially transforming how the U.S. funds itself long-term.</p>

          <h2>Switzerland's Major Role in Gold Refining Cited as Key Factor in High U.S. Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 10:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Switzerland was hit with an unexpectedly high 39% tariff by the U.S., partly because of its massive trade surplus, which is significantly inflated by its gold refining industry. Although gold is exempt from the tariff, the Trump administration included its value in trade balance calculations, making the deficit appear much larger. Swiss officials and economists argue this is misleading, as the country's refiners only earn a small processing fee on the vast amounts of gold that pass through. As a result, other Swiss industries like luxury goods and precision instruments will bear the brunt of the heavy tariffs.</p>

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump aimed at addressing homelessness is drawing sharp criticism from experts who say it will criminalize vulnerable populations. The order instructs local governments to crack down on public camping and loitering and pushes for shifting unhoused individuals into "long-term institutional settings." Critics argue the vaguely worded order could be used to detain people with mental health or substance use issues without due process. They also note that the policy moves away from proven "housing-first" strategies while the administration is simultaneously proposing cuts to affordable housing programs, potentially exacerbating the crisis.</p>

While total trade was down slightly compared to the same month last year, China's imports from Russia, largely driven by energy, saw a notable increase. This comes as the U.S. has threatened tariffs on countries importing Russian oil, highlighting the complex geopolitical and economic dynamics at play as Moscow seeks to offset Western sanctions.

          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a "new and highly accurate CENSUS" that will not count undocumented immigrants. In a social media post, he stated the new count would be based on information from the 2024 presidential election. This move represents his latest attempt to alter the decennial census, which is constitutionally mandated to count all persons and is used to apportion congressional seats and federal funding. The announcement comes as Trump supports Republican efforts in Texas to redraw congressional maps, a process that relies on census data, and follows a previous failed attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates, despite inflation remaining well above its 2% target, was a closely contested move. The primary justification is the Bank's medium-term forecast, which sees weakening pressure on inflation from the labor market due to a rise in unemployment and a fall in job vacancies. However, the move is risky with current inflation still high, and it prompted dissent from two members of the rate-setting committee. The Bank hopes the cut will help stimulate a sluggish economy, which has been weighed down by a high savings rate and weak consumer confidence.</p>

A home equity loan provides a lump sum at a fixed rate, while a HELOC offers a variable-rate revolving line of credit.
