          <p>Two young Palestinian men, one of whom was a U.S. citizen visiting from Florida, were killed in an attack by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. Family members state that 20-year-old Sayfollah Musallet was beaten to death, while 23-year-old Mohammed al-Shalabi was shot. The incident has heightened tensions and prompted calls for a U.S. State Department investigation, highlighting a documented increase in settler violence since October 2023. The families and local community are mourning the loss while expressing frustration over a perceived lack of accountability and protection for Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian reportedly sustained minor leg injuries during Israeli airstrikes on a secret underground facility in Tehran last month. According to Iran's Fars news agency, the attack targeted an emergency meeting of the Supreme National Security Council, trapping officials before they escaped through an emergency shaft. The report, which has not been independently verified, suggests a significant intelligence breach, as Israel also allegedly targeted Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This event has escalated tensions, with Pezeshkian accusing Israel of an assassination attempt, a claim Israel denies.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Rand Paul detailed the findings of a Senate report on the assassination attempt against then-candidate Trump, describing it as a "cascade of errors." Paul stated that the Secret Service denied multiple requests for additional security, including counter-snipers, which were only approved for the Butler rally where the shooting occurred. He accused the former Secret Service director of not telling the truth to Congress and described a "cultural cover-up" within the agency to avoid blame. Paul emphasized that no one was fired for the severe security lapses, which he deemed inexcusable.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that President Trump has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell "if there's cause." This comment suggests the White House is actively considering the possibility, escalating its criticism of Powell by targeting a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. The administration alleges a $700 million budget overrun and has demanded answers, potentially laying the groundwork to justify Powell's removal. The move signals continued friction between the administration and the central bank over monetary policy and institutional management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about deporting dangerous criminals, recent government data reveals a different reality about individuals detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). As of late June, over 71% of people in ICE detention had no criminal convictions, and the majority were not classified as a high-level threat. This discrepancy is highlighted by a recent surge in ICE arrests following a new daily quota. Critics and policy experts argue this data shows a deep disconnect between the administration's public justification for its aggressive deportation agenda and its actual enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The decision by Republican Senator Thom Tillis not to seek re-election in 2026 is set to make North Carolina's Senate race a key political battleground. His retirement opens up a competitive seat in a swing state that both parties will fiercely contest. For Democrats, this presents a significant opportunity to capture a Senate seat in the South, a region where they have faced electoral challenges. The race is expected to attract national attention and substantial campaign funding, as its outcome could be crucial in determining the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. The political landscape in the state is now primed for a toss-up election.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study is renewing the long-standing debate over the prevalence and severity of withdrawal symptoms experienced by patients when they stop taking antidepressants. The research has sparked discussion among medical professionals and patients about what is often termed "discontinuation syndrome." Key points of contention include how common these symptoms are, how debilitating they can be, and how the medical community should manage the process of tapering patients off these widely prescribed medications. The findings contribute to an ongoing conversation about the long-term use and effects of antidepressant drugs on mental and physical health.</p>

          <p>A government official in Spain has stated that an outbreak of violence between residents and migrants in the southeastern town of Torre Pacheco was fueled by social media posts from far-right groups. The disturbance, which resulted in five minor injuries and one arrest, reportedly followed an online incitement for a "hunt for migrants." Tensions escalated after an elderly man was attacked days earlier by unknown assailants, allegedly of North African origin. Authorities have deployed a major police presence to prevent further confrontations and are investigating possible hate crimes, calling for calm to be restored in the town.</p>

          <p>As geopolitical tensions with China disrupt supply chains for rare earth metals, the recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) is emerging as a critical alternative source for the U.S. Traditionally overlooked, next-generation recyclers are now innovating ways to extract valuable materials like copper, gold, and critical rare earths from discarded electronics. This trend is driven by unpredictable trade policies and the need to onshore production of vital components for technology, from consumer devices to military hardware. This growing industry presents an opportunity to create a more localized and secure supply chain for essential materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's recent large-scale military exercises are being closely watched by Beijing, prompting analysis of how China is likely to respond to the show of force. According to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, Beijing's reaction will be carefully calibrated to signal its disapproval without escalating the situation into a direct conflict. China will likely view the drills as a provocation but may respond with its own military posturing, propaganda, and economic pressure rather than immediate military action. The key for Beijing is to assert its sovereignty claims over Taiwan while managing regional stability and its international image.</p>

          <p>The use of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that combines DNA analysis with family tree research, is proving to be a revolutionary tool for solving cold cases. The method gained prominence with the capture of the Golden State Killer, who was identified by amateur sleuth Barbara Rae-Venter using public genealogy databases. Law enforcement agencies are now increasingly adopting this technique to identify suspects in decades-old crimes, including murders and sexual assaults, by building family trees from crime scene DNA. While the practice has raised privacy concerns, it has also brought long-awaited justice to victims and their families.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has bolstered its security protocols with new technology. The agency has implemented a fleet of military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance and mobile command posts to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement. These changes address critical failures identified from the Butler incident, where the shooter flew a drone undetected and communication between agencies was fragmented. The upgrades are part of a broader effort to prevent a repeat of the security lapses that allowed the attack to occur.</p>

His firm stance contrasts with calls for a more pragmatic, negotiated solution from other EU leaders in Germany and Italy.

          <p>Grok, the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's X, is under scrutiny after it was found to be generating antisemitic, bigoted, and inappropriate remarks. This issue highlights a persistent problem plaguing large language models, where the vast datasets used for training can contain and amplify harmful biases present in online content. Reporter Reece Rogers notes that fixing these AI systems is a complex challenge, requiring improved content moderation, refined training data, and robust safety filters. The incident with Grok adds to the growing public and regulatory concern over the potential for AI chatbots to spread misinformation and hate speech.</p>

          <p>Experts are actively debunking the baseless and harmful conspiracy theory that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding, a weather modification technique. Despite claims from some politicians and online voices, meteorologists and atmospheric scientists confirm that current cloud seeding technology cannot generate the massive, sustained rainfall that led to the catastrophe. They explain that the practice can only modestly enhance precipitation from existing storm systems, not create them. Spreading this misinformation is considered damaging as it erodes public trust in science and distracts from the real, climate-related factors contributing to extreme weather events.</p>

The move aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption for many families. The government is under pressure to meet its targets for phasing out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, but critics argue more needs to be done.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's idea of replacing migrant farmworkers with "able-bodied" adults on Medicaid is facing scrutiny and skepticism from policy experts. Robin Rudowitz of the health policy organization KFF highlights the significant practical challenges of such a proposal. Many Medicaid enrollees who are not officially disabled still face health issues, lack transportation, or live far from agricultural areas. Furthermore, the physically demanding nature of farm labor is often a poor match for this population. Critics argue the plan oversimplifies the complex realities of both the agricultural labor market and the circumstances of people enrolled in Medicaid.</p>
