        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin's late-game coaching decisions faced public criticism during the team's narrow 24-21 victory against the Minnesota Vikings. With just over a minute remaining, Tomlin opted to take a delay-of-game penalty and punt on fourth down from the Vikings' 40-yard line, rather than attempting to secure a first down. While the Steelers' defense ultimately held on to prevent a game-tying or winning drive, many fans expressed frustration with the conservative play-calling. The win improved the Steelers' season record to 3-1, but the debate over coaching strategy overshadowed the outcome.</p>

          <p>Several individuals were arrested during a protest outside the Labour party conference in Liverpool for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. Demonstrators held signs stating, "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action," leading to arrests on suspicion of supporting a banned organization. The UK government outlawed the group in July, making any form of support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Organizers of the protest are calling for the ban to be lifted, arguing it infringes on the right to free speech and political expression.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine expressed deep concern over a potential government shutdown, emphasizing the negative impact it would have on the 140,000 federal workers in his state. He criticized the president for not engaging in negotiations sooner, drawing parallels to previous shutdowns under other administrations. Kaine also addressed the recent resignations of two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, asserting they were forced out for refusing to bow to political pressure from the White House. He concluded by discussing foreign policy, supporting the creation of a Palestinian state and urging against Israeli annexation of the West Bank.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with top bipartisan congressional leaders in a final attempt to negotiate a funding deal and prevent a government shutdown. The meeting comes after days of political stalemate, with Democrats insisting that an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies be included in any spending bill. Republicans have argued that the healthcare debate can wait until after the immediate funding crisis is resolved.

          <p>The new Paul Thomas Anderson film, "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, debuted at the top of the box office with $22.4 million in domestic ticket sales. The adult drama, which also features Sean Penn and Regina Hall, performed solidly against industry expectations, continuing a successful streak for Warner Bros. studio. Despite concerns about attracting older audiences back to theaters for dramatic films, the movie benefited from strong critical reviews and awards season buzz. The film's success is seen as a significant win for the studio, adding to a year of high-grossing releases.</p>

          <p>European golfer Viktor Hovland has withdrawn from his Sunday singles match at the Ryder Cup due to a persistent neck injury. As a result, his match against Harris English of the United States has been declared a half, with each team awarded half a point. This development brings Europe's lead to 12-5, meaning they now need only two more points from the remaining 11 matches to retain the trophy. Hovland's absence is a blow to the European team, but their substantial lead keeps them in a commanding position to win the event.</p>

The prohibition will be in effect from Monday to Friday as the country prepares to host an EU summit and a meeting of the European Political Community.

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly voted in favor of a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system, with 50.4% supporting the measure. This vote reverses a 2021 rejection of a similar proposal, with the new plan addressing previous privacy concerns by keeping data decentralized on users' smartphones and under government control. Proponents argue the digital ID will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes, from signing contracts to age verification. Opponents, however, remain concerned about potential data misuse and the erosion of privacy, a long-held value in Swiss culture.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a significant public health crisis as its diabetes prevalence has nearly doubled over the past two decades, reaching over 16% of the adult population. This rate is the highest in the European region and almost twice the EU average, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Public health experts attribute the dramatic increase to national food policies, lack of exercise, and high consumption of carbohydrates and sugars. Critics argue that the government's health policies have failed to effectively combat obesity, a primary risk factor, and that many cases of diabetes remain undiagnosed or poorly managed.</p>

          <p>The German government is planning to open direct negotiations with the Taliban to establish a process for deporting Afghan nationals convicted of crimes or deemed security threats back to Afghanistan. According to Germany's Interior Minister, officials will travel to Kabul in October to discuss the arrangement, which aims to use commercial flights for regular repatriations. This move comes as Berlin also seeks a deportation agreement with Syria. The plan has drawn criticism from human rights groups who argue that Afghanistan is unsafe under the current Taliban regime, making such deportations dangerous.</p>

          <p>The stock market faces a pivotal week with two major factors influencing investor sentiment and Federal Reserve policy. Upcoming jobs data, including the September nonfarm payrolls report, will be closely watched for signs of labor market weakness that could prompt further interest rate cuts. Additionally, the looming threat of a government shutdown adds a layer of uncertainty, as President Trump is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders to negotiate a funding deal. The performance of the Treasury market will also be a key indicator for investors monitoring economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain, labeling the policy as both "racist" and "immoral." Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer argued that the plan, which could lead to the deportation of people legally residing in the country, would "rip this country apart." He distinguished between removing illegal migrants and targeting lawful residents who are integrated into society. Starmer suggested that support for Reform UK stems from public frustration with years of Conservative government failure rather than from widespread racism among its voters.</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a key band from the 1960s British Invasion, are reflecting on their unusual career trajectory, marked by delayed success and eventual recognition. Their first hit, "She's Not There," quickly topped the charts, but their critically acclaimed 1968 album "Odessey and Oracle" was initially a commercial failure, leading the band to break up. A year later, a track from that album, "Time of the Season," unexpectedly became a massive hit. More than five decades later, the band has been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, cementing their legacy in music history.</p>

While the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports annualized inflation at 2.9%, other indexes like Truflation and Zillow's rent index show lower figures. However, leading indicators from the Institute for Supply Management and the National Federation of Independent Businesses suggest that rising costs for businesses could lead to future price increases for consumers. These alternative metrics, which track real-time prices for commodities, online goods, and business expenses, provide a broader perspective on economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is implementing an industrial "pull system" aimed at mass-producing rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This new model contrasts with the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and excess inventory. In the pull system, final assembly lines draw components from suppliers only when needed, a method designed to increase speed, ensure quality, and lower costs. As global space activity is projected to grow exponentially, mastering this scalable production technique could position China as a dominant force in the future space industry.</p>

          <p>A communications expert and former world champion debater, Kate Mason, advises professionals to avoid using certain phrases that can undermine their credibility and minimize their contributions at work. Phrases such as "It'll just take a second," "No worries if not," and "I'm not an expert, but..." are often used with good intentions but can signal a lack of confidence or urgency. Mason suggests using more direct and specific language to convey the importance of a request or idea.

According to a report from Cushman & Wakefield, the national shopping center vacancy rate rose to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2025. This has allowed independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and other small enterprises to negotiate more favorable lease terms in locations they were previously priced out of.

          <p>For neurodivergent individuals who may face challenges like executive dysfunction or time blindness, automating finances is the most effective money management strategy, according to financial coach Andrea Ewalefo. She advises setting up automatic payments for all bills and auto-drafts for savings and investments to coincide with paydays. This approach reduces decision fatigue and preserves mental energy, or "spoons," for other tasks. By ensuring essential financial obligations are met automatically, individuals can have more freedom to manage their remaining funds without the stress of potentially missing payments or savings goals.</p>

Cohen argued that the Department of Justice possesses a vast amount of Comey's communications and, based on his own experience with a "weaponized DOJ," he believes they will secure a conviction. The other panelists, including Molly Jong-Fast, were visibly shocked by his statement, questioning his reasoning. Cohen drew a parallel to his own case, suggesting the sheer volume of documents available to prosecutors makes a guilty verdict probable.</p>
