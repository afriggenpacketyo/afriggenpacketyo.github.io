          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he will meet with his Chinese counterparts for a third round of high-level trade talks in Stockholm next week. The discussions aim to resolve ongoing trade disputes and could lead to an extension of the current pause on significant tariffs that both nations have imposed on each other's exports. Both Washington and Beijing have expressed cautious optimism about the progress of the negotiations. The meeting signals a continued effort to de-escalate economic tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has started its August recess ahead of schedule, a move that prevents votes on motions to release Department of Justice files related to Jeffrey Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson characterized the Democratic-led efforts to force a vote as "political games," asserting that the DOJ is already handling the matter appropriately. The decision has drawn criticism, including from some Republicans, for avoiding a potentially divisive vote. This development occurs as the Trump administration takes separate steps to increase transparency in the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey indicates that a growing majority of retirees, about two-thirds, now heavily rely on Social Security for their income, a significant increase from two decades ago. Despite its importance, public confidence in the program's future stability is waning, with many Americans worried it will not provide enough to live on. The survey highlights a paradox where the program is more crucial than ever, yet faces long-term financial challenges that could lead to benefit cuts by 2034. These findings underscore the urgent need for policy solutions to ensure the program's solvency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in a new federal bill proposes to cut $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over ten years, largely by shifting the program's costs to individual states. This change would force states to either absorb the significant financial burden or scale back benefits, potentially removing over three million people from the program. Critics argue the move undermines SNAP's purpose of feeding low-income Americans and could overwhelm food banks.

Lynch, who died in a yachting accident last year, had denied the allegations, claiming HPE mismanaged the acquisition.

The analysis in this article suggests both views are partially correct but miss the larger trend: the era of broadly appealing, mass-audience late-night television is over.

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's saw a dramatic surge of over 30% in highly volatile trading, reminiscent of past meme stock rallies. The stock's trading volume was nearly 17 times its 30-day average, with no specific company news to explain the movement. The company has become a target for retail investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets due to its high short interest, where about 50% of its shares are sold short. This activity occurs as the underlying business continues to face challenges, including falling sales and leadership instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Understanding the Nuances of Credit Card Payment Grace Periods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the common misunderstanding of credit card grace periods, explaining that they primarily apply to new purchases, not late payments. Most credit cards offer a window of 21 to 25 days after a billing cycle ends, during which a balance paid in full incurs no interest. However, this grace period is often forfeited if a balance is carried over from the previous month. For late payments, issuers are not required to offer a grace period, and fees or penalty APRs can be applied immediately, though some may offer a brief, informal window for customers with a good history.</p>

          <p>German authorities have deported 43 Iraqi citizens on a charter flight from Leipzig to Baghdad. Officials from the state of Thuringia stated that all those deported were single men who were required to leave the country, with some having prior criminal convictions. The operation comes just days after a similar deportation flight of Afghan citizens and occurs as EU interior ministers meet to discuss tougher migration policies. The move signals a hardening stance on immigration and repatriation within Germany and the broader European Union.</p>

          <p>A new Harvard University study analyzing over 58,000 women suggests that the sex of children in a family may not be a simple 50/50 probability. Researchers found that after having two children of the same sex, the likelihood of the third child also being that same sex increases, a pattern they call a "weighted coin toss." For example, after three boys, the chance of a fourth boy was 61%. The study suggests a potential biological tendency within families toward having boys or girls, with factors like maternal age at first birth showing a small but significant correlation.</p>

This follows the controversial 2023 Patriotic Act, which already imposes severe penalties, including life imprisonment, for actions that threaten "national interests." Opposition lawmakers and human rights groups argue these moves are an attempt to legislate loyalty, silence dissent, and create a one-party state.
