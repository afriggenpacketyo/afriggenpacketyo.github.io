          <p>The brother of Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew of sexual abuse, is urging King Charles to strip Andrew of his "prince" title. This call for further action comes after the prince voluntarily relinquished his other royal and military titles, including the Duke of York, amid ongoing scrutiny over his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre's brother expressed that this development brings a sense of vindication for his late sister and other survivors, emphasizing the need for accountability for anyone implicated in the scandal. He stated that survivors are no longer staying silent and that this represents a moment of justice.</p>

          <p>A 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 in Southern California was temporarily closed to accommodate a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton. The event, part of the Marines' 250th-anniversary celebration, involved firing 155mm artillery shells over the major freeway, prompting safety concerns and significant traffic disruptions. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the plan as an "absurd show of force" and a reckless action directed by the White House. The unprecedented closure highlights growing tensions between state and federal authorities and coincided with nationwide anti-Trump protests.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Mikie Sherrill participated in a "No Kings" protest, where she publicly committed to fighting President Trump's agenda "tooth and nail." At the event in Montclair, Sherrill, alongside other prominent Democrats like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, criticized the administration and her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli. The rally was used as a platform to energize voters and frame the upcoming election as a referendum on the president's policies. This appearance highlights how the nationwide protests are intersecting with state-level political campaigns ahead of the election.</p>

          <p>Protesters gathered in cities across the United States and worldwide for "No Kings" demonstrations against the Trump administration's policies. Organizers, anticipating millions of participants, cited concerns over immigration crackdowns, the deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities, and attacks on the media as key motivations for the rallies. The events, which follow similar large-scale protests from June, are framed by participants as a stand against perceived authoritarianism. In contrast, prominent Republicans have labeled the demonstrations as "Hate America" rallies, highlighting the deep political division surrounding the events.</p>

          <p>A second wave of "No Kings" rallies occurred nationwide, organized by a coalition of activist groups to protest what they describe as abuses of power by the Trump administration. The article explains that these demonstrations aim to connect frustrated citizens with local organizing groups for sustained political action beyond a single day of protest. It also details the starkly contrasting political reactions, with Republicans branding the events as "Hate America" rallies and some governors activating law enforcement in anticipation. Organizers have pushed back, asserting that protesting against perceived authoritarianism is a fundamentally American act.</p>

The author explores D'Angelo's complex relationship with fame, particularly after the iconic video for "Untitled (How Does It Feel)," and his deep connection to the traditions of Black music, which he saw as a continuation rather than a revival.

The study's author suggests that this pattern, often unintentional, can influence public perception of danger and align with right-wing populist narratives.

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to commit, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more likely to want to move in together or marry sooner. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial savings was a key motivator for men to speed up these relationship milestones. Experts suggest that beyond finances, men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships as their primary source of social and emotional support, which can lead to lower psychological well-being when they are single. This challenges traditional narratives about relationship dynamics.</p>

          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that its most important competition has been held outside of Japan. The event required significant logistical efforts to maintain authenticity, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. More than 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, are competing in the five-day tournament. Organizers have made efforts to educate the Western audience on the sport's deep cultural and religious traditions, which are rooted in Shintoism.</p>

          <p>Carlynn Greene, who won 30 scholarships to graduate college debt-free, advises prospective students on common pitfalls in the application process. She recommends against applying only for large, national scholarships with huge applicant pools and instead focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships with more specific criteria. Greene emphasizes that applying is a numbers game and suggests using online tools to apply for 100 to 200 scholarships to maximize chances. She also stresses treating the application essay as a marketing tool to convince committees to invest in one's education.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market recovered this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting gains despite initial volatility from several economic pressures. The market was shaken mid-week by disclosures of bad loans from regional banks Zions and Western Alliance, which triggered a selloff in financial stocks over credit quality fears. However, the market later stabilized as traders appeared to view the incidents as isolated rather than systemic. Strong earnings reports from major banks like Wells Fargo provided an early boost, while ongoing concerns about the federal government shutdown continued to influence investor sentiment.

          <p>A grassroots group in Missouri, "People Not Politicians," is working to gather over 106,000 signatures for a petition to place a referendum on the 2026 ballot. The goal is to let voters decide the fate of a new congressional map, which was recently signed into law and is widely seen as gerrymandered to favor Republicans by targeting a Democratic seat in Kansas City. The effort faces legal challenges from the state's top election officials but has seen strong public support. The situation in Missouri is part of a broader national battle over redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</p>
