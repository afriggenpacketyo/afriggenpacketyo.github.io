          <p>Two American aid workers from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) sustained non-life-threatening injuries in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis. The GHF, a U.S. and Israel-backed organization, accused Hamas of the attack, a claim echoed by the U.S. State Department without immediate evidence. This incident occurs amid broader violence, including Israeli airstrikes that killed 14 Palestinians, and ongoing debates about aid distribution, with Hamas and the UN criticizing the GHF system. The violence continues as U.S.-led efforts for a 60-day ceasefire appear to be gaining traction with Hamas giving a "positive" response.</p>

          <p>Actress Heather Graham, 55, recently shared a series of photos on Instagram from her vacation in Sardinia, Italy, displaying her collection of bikinis and one-piece swimsuits. The post, which also featured a photo with fellow actress Jane Seymour, 74, garnered praise from her followers. In recent interviews, Graham has attributed her ageless appearance and positive outlook to a healthy lifestyle that includes no alcohol or drugs, getting plenty of sleep, and practicing affirmations. She emphasized that feeling good internally is what matters most and that she feels happier as she has gotten older.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Poland's Bialowieza primeval forest, on the border with Belarus, where migrants are frequently injured and left stranded. Human rights activists from Grupa Granica provide essential aid like food, water, and medical care to people who have sustained injuries, often from the five-meter-high border fence. Despite the barrier, migrants from countries like Syria, Eritrea, and Sudan continue to attempt the crossing, with activists reporting thousands of emergency calls. Polish authorities have been accused of illegal pushbacks and criminalizing aid work, creating a perilous situation for both the migrants and the volunteers trying to help them.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain observed the changes to the landscape and culture that had occurred since his time as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its freedom. The excerpt highlights Twain's deep emotional connection to the river, describing his joy at being back in a pilot house as a dreamlike experience that made him feel as though the intervening years had disappeared.

          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full, unexpurgated autobiography is being published a century after his death, revealing his candid thoughts on his life and times. The work was dictated over four years and intentionally structured in a non-linear, blog-like style, allowing him to speak freely without fear of hurting those he wrote about. The autobiography contains sharp critiques of figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and raw emotion about his family, but Twain himself admitted he failed to document his most "shameful" acts. The 100-year embargo is seen as both a way to ensure honesty and a brilliant marketing strategy from the iconic American author.</p>

The teams have opted for different car setups, with Red Bull prioritizing straight-line speed while McLaren and Ferrari have focused more on cornering performance.

The artist stated the mural reflects that the values of freedom and hope the statue once represented have been lost for many, particularly in Roubaix, which has a large migrant population. The artwork's unveiling on July 4, the anniversary of France gifting the statue to the U.S., was described as a "meaningful coincidence."</p>

The AI corrected the misconception that billionaires pay a lower percentage, noting their average federal income tax rate is around 16%, comparable to many middle-class households. However, the key difference lies in how income is taxed; the system taxes wages from work more heavily than wealth gained from investments. ChatGPT explained the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where the wealthy borrow against their appreciating assets tax-free, allowing them to live off loans and pass on wealth with minimal tax burden.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As recovery efforts commence in Texas following flash floods that killed at least 27 people, including nine-year-old Renee Smajstrla, questions are being raised about the disaster's foreseeability. Officials stated that the intensity of the downpour, which caused the Guadalupe River to rise dramatically, was not predicted by the National Weather Service. This has led to scrutiny, with some critics linking the forecast's alleged inaccuracy to recent budget and job cuts at the NWS under the Trump administration. President Trump has expressed his condolences while search and rescue operations continue for dozens of missing people, including many children from a summer camp.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing backlash for sending an email claiming that a new bill signed by President Trump "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled this statement as misleading and a "lie," as the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction for seniors. This deduction also phases out for individuals with incomes over $75,000. The communication is being blasted as an uncharacteristically partisan statement from a typically apolitical agency, politicizing federal benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A focus group of 2024 Labour voters from Kent, organized by the BBC, has revealed a significant sense of disappointment with the party's first year in government. Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key issues like immigration and felt that the government had not been straightforward about its plans. While some were forgiving, citing the need to "steady the ship," others felt "lied to." The government's recent U-turns on policy were also noted, with one voter stating it reinforces the idea that "there is no direction," reflecting the challenges Labour faces in maintaining voter trust.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Reform UK Member of Parliament, has voluntarily given up the party whip pending an investigation into his business dealings. The move comes after a newspaper report raised questions about the eligibility of two of his companies for £70,000 in government-backed Bounce Back loans during the COVID-19 pandemic. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing, stating his business affairs were compliant with all regulations, but said he requested the suspension as a "precautionary measure." Reform UK will conduct its own internal investigation into the allegations, making McMurdock the second of five Reform MPs elected in 2024 to lose the whip.</p>

          <p>Recent threats of retribution by President Donald Trump against political and business opponents have escalated concerns about the state of U.S. democracy. In the past week, Trump has suggested repercussions for Elon Musk, the prospective mayor of New York Zohran Mamdani, and a former Biden administration official. Pro-democracy advocates warn that these actions, which include menacing a critic's citizenship and calling for arrests, are designed to instill fear and silence opposition. Critics argue that when the president weaponizes the state against those he dislikes, it erodes the fundamental freedom of speech, regardless of whether the threats are ultimately carried out.</p>

The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle that reached the Supreme Court. Immigration advocates fought the deportation, arguing it was punitive and unconstitutional, and that the men could face torture or other harms in a country the U.S. State Department warns its own citizens against visiting. The administration defended the action as a victory for national security, marking a new and controversial phase in its immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>The rise of digital payment screens has led to "tipflation," where customers are increasingly prompted to tip in situations where it was not previously standard, such as at fast-food counters or self-service kiosks. These systems often present pre-calculated options of 15%, 20%, or 25%, creating social pressure and confusion for consumers. Experts note that while this technology can increase income for service workers, it also benefits the tech companies who charge transaction fees. This shift, accelerated during the pandemic, has altered social norms around tipping, leaving many customers unsure of the proper etiquette and feeling pressured into "guilt tipping."

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iran may strengthen North Korea's resolve to maintain and advance its nuclear weapons program, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang could view the U.S. action as confirmation that nuclear weapons are the only true guarantee of regime survival against an unpredictable American administration. This perception could lead North Korea to further invest in its arsenal, prioritizing mobile systems and second-strike capabilities. The development is seen as a potential setback for any remaining hopes of denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, an issue previously discussed in historic but ultimately unsuccessful talks between Trump and Kim Jong-un.</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the alcohol-free beverage can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The drink typically contains coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there are no scientific studies to support the idea that these ingredients, individually or combined, can reduce cortisol levels. Doctors note that the drink is mostly harmless and can aid hydration, which may contribute to a feeling of well-being, but they caution against it for individuals with certain health conditions like kidney disease or diabetes.</p>
