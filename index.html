        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Rams, despite not making any immediate, high-profile selections in the 2025 NFL draft, are considered to have strategically positioned themselves for success in future drafts. General Manager Les Snead orchestrated a trade with the Atlanta Falcons, acquiring a first-round pick in the 2026 draft, giving the Rams two first-round picks that year. This move provides the Rams with significant draft capital to potentially replace veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford and acquire other key players, ensuring the team's continued competitiveness in the coming years, especially with the Super Bowl LXI being held at SoFi Stadium in 2026. The Rams also focused on augmenting their current roster with selections in later rounds, indicating a balanced approach to both immediate and long-term team building.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who alleged she was sexually trafficked to Prince Andrew and others, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41.

Giuffre had filed a lawsuit against Prince Andrew in 2021, which was settled out of court in 2022, and formed a nonprofit called SOAR to advocate for sex trafficking victims.

While wildfires are common in the UK during early spring, the scale of the burns this year has put a strain on fire services and raised concerns about the potential for more severe fires later in the year, especially with climate change increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather.</p>

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a longtime loyalist, as his deputy, a move seen as a potential signal of succession plans. The appointment comes as the war in Gaza continues and a sweeping Israeli military operation in the West Bank displaces thousands, underscoring the Palestinian Authority's focus on internal politics.
