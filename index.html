          <p>China experienced a surge in domestic tourism bookings during the Dragon Boat Festival weekend, which unusually coincided with Children‚Äôs Day. Travel platforms reported a significant increase in short-haul domestic travel, driven by families seeking ‚Äúsummer escapes‚Äù to campsites, amusement parks, and other attractions. Bookings for theme park tickets and campsites rose substantially compared to the previous year, with family hotel packages also seeing an increase in demand. This trend reflects a growing interest in domestic travel within China, focusing on cultural experiences and adventures, while also being mindful of economic uncertainties. The tourism sector is viewed by Chinese officials as a vital component in supporting the nation‚Äôs service industry.</p>

          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, leading to a surge in both companies' stock prices. The deal involves a new Sydney-listed company acquiring all outstanding shares of Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers. Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the previous closing price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China refuted accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, countering that the U.S. is undermining the consensus reached. Trade tensions have resurfaced following a meeting in Geneva where both countries agreed to suspend tariffs for 90 days, with the U.S. imposing export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals while threatening to revoke visas for Chinese students. China vowed to safeguard its rights and benefits if the U.S. continues actions damaging its interests, while also maintaining control over rare earth exports. Despite these tensions, there are suggestions that a meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping could occur soon to address the stalled trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the first nation to select judges and magistrates by popular vote. Supporters argue this is needed to overhaul a judicial system plagued by corruption and inefficiency, while critics fear it will politicize the judiciary in a country struggling with crime and gang violence. Voters were tasked with electing around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates, but turnout appeared low.
