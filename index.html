          <p>This article posits that a series of recent victories, including Supreme Court rulings favorable to his agenda and successful pressure campaigns on international and domestic issues, have significantly emboldened former President Donald Trump. His actions, such as publicly calling for the dismissal of criminal charges against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and forcing Canada to rescind a tech tax, are presented as examples of an increasingly aggressive and confident approach. The piece suggests these successes reinforce his unconventional tactics, allowing him to expand his political power and effectively neutralize opponents. The author observes that even when facing negative media coverage, Trump's strategy appears to thrive on driving the public conversation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new framework using satellite remote sensing technology to more accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. The study highlights that this optimized model could establish a standardized, high-precision methodology for global carbon inventory, addressing current gaps in international carbon accounting. Researchers state the technology shows significant potential for monitoring emissions from other industrial sources as well, such as steel plants or oil and gas fields. This innovation could enable retrospective analysis of historical data to identify unusual emission events and improve environmental oversight.</p>

          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza on Monday resulted in at least 74 Palestinian deaths, according to health officials and witnesses. A deadly airstrike hit a crowded seaside cafe in Gaza City, killing at least 30 people, including women and children who had gathered there for internet access. In separate incidents, Israeli forces reportedly opened fire on Palestinians attempting to collect food aid, resulting in numerous fatalities. These events occurred amid an intensified Israeli bombardment campaign across northern Gaza, with residents describing a "scorched earth" strategy that makes it difficult for emergency services to reach victims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her duties pending a ruling on her potential dismissal. The case stems from a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, which sparked public anger and accusations that she undermined the nation's military. This development places her powerful family's political dynasty in further jeopardy, as she could become the third Shinawatra to be removed from power prematurely. The suspension adds to the political instability in Thailand, with her father, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, also facing a trial for allegedly insulting the monarchy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted a marathon voting session on President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," a key piece of his second-term agenda, as Republicans aimed to pass it before July 4th. The legislative push involves a "vote-a-rama," where senators can offer unlimited amendments, a tactic Democrats are using to force votes on controversial issues before the midterm elections. The bill, which increases spending on border security and defense while cutting healthcare programs, is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the deficit. Despite some Republican opposition, including from Senator Thom Tillis, GOP leadership is pressing forward.</p>

          <p>Major banks and financial analysts are offering mixed views on President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," with some supporting it as a necessary economic stimulus while others warn of its fiscal risks. Proponents, including the American Bankers Association and strategists at Nomura and Citi, argue the bill would prevent a fiscal contraction by extending expiring tax cuts and could boost investment. However, critics highlight the significant downside, pointing to the Congressional Budget Office's projection that it will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit. Concerns about fiscal sustainability are central to the opposition's arguments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iowa has officially removed gender identity from its civil rights code, becoming the first state to roll back such protections for transgender and nonbinary individuals in areas like employment and housing. The new law, which took effect Tuesday, also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and bars changes to birth certificates. Governor Kim Reynolds stated the move was "common sense" to protect women and girls, while opponents, including the state's first transgender lawmaker, fear it will foster hostility and discrimination. The law is part of a broader trend of Republican-led states advancing restrictions on transgender rights.</p>

The violence is attributed to an ongoing, bloody power struggle between two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, known as Los Chapitos and La Mayiza.

They argue the system violates humanitarian norms by forcing desperate people into dangerous zones to get food. Israel defends the GHF, stating it bypasses Hamas and provides direct assistance to those in need.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that capitalism is retreating from supporting progressive social change, using the sudden termination of the Financial Fairness Trust by its corporate sponsor, Aberdeen Group, as a key example. The trust, which funded influential research into inequality by organizations like the IFS and Resolution Foundation, was shut down abruptly, a move the author links to a broader anti-ESG (environmental, social, and governance) trend. The piece suggests that in the current political climate, companies are becoming wary of being associated with research that questions financial systems, signaling a darker turn in corporate attitudes.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has taken on the one-month rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council, a role it will hold for the eighth time. The position is largely symbolic but comes at a period of significant global instability and heightened geopolitical friction.

The presidency is expected to see Pakistan raise the issue of its recent conflict with India over Kashmir, while India is reportedly preparing a diplomatic strategy to counter Islamabad's narrative during its term.</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the conspicuous absence of France's role in the transatlantic slave trade and its broader colonial history from its own national cinema. The author notes that French audiences often learn about slavery through American films, while French-made stories on the subject remain rare and marginalized. The article praises recent, independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" for finally addressing these topics but laments their lack of mainstream recognition at major festivals like Cannes. It argues that while audiences are ready to confront this history, the French film industry is still slow to make space for these vital narratives.</p>

This upbeat reading, which primarily reflects export-oriented firms, may be a delayed response to a U.S.-China tariff reduction.

          <p>The commander of U.S. Northern Command has requested that some of the California National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles be shifted to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The proposal would move 200 of the approximately 4,000 Guard members from their controversial deployment dealing with immigration-related protests to firefighting duties. The initial deployment, ordered by President Trump over the governor's objections, has been criticized for straining resources needed for wildfire response. This potential reassignment comes as California officials warn of an early and active fire season ahead.</p>

          <h2>Release of Mistakenly Deported Man Delayed Amid Fears of a Second Deportation</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has delayed the pretrial release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers requested the delay, citing conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be immediately detained by immigration authorities and deported again upon his release from Justice Department custody. Abrego Garcia's initial removal was deemed an error because he held a legal status protecting him from deportation. The case highlights the complex legal challenges within the U.S. immigration system.</p>
