          <p>Ceasefire talks in Qatar have stalled, with the U.S. envoy recalling the negotiating team and blaming Hamas for a lack of good faith. Hamas countered that it has consistently sought a viable deal to end the suffering of its people. The breakdown in talks occurs as the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates, with the United Nations and other aid organizations reporting that Palestinian children are starving to death due to an ongoing blockade and severe restrictions on aid delivery.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for a second day of interviews. Her lawyer stated she answered all questions without holding back, which reportedly concerned around 100 different people. The meetings have drawn attention as President Trump has not ruled out a potential pardon, though he claims it is not something he has considered. Maxwell's team has not formally requested a pardon but indicated they would welcome any form of relief.</p>

          <h2>Former Prosecutors View Justice Department's Interview with Ghislaine Maxwell as Unorthodox and Concerning</h2>

          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have expressed bewilderment over Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's direct involvement in interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell. They describe the move as highly unorthodox, breaking with the standard practice of having line prosecutors who are familiar with the case conduct such interviews. Critics suggest the meeting appears to be politically motivated to address public pressure, raising serious questions about the credibility of any information Maxwell might provide given her potential desperation for a reduced sentence.</p>

          <p>The article explores the validity and flexibility of common health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting seven to nine hours of sleep, and exercising 150 minutes per week. Experts offer varied perspectives, suggesting that while some goals like adequate sleep are crucial, others have more wriggle room and should be adapted to individual needs. The consensus is that while these benchmarks are useful for guidance, individuals should focus on a holistic, consistent approach to health rather than fixating on achieving specific numbers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has warned five school districts in northern Virginia that they have ten days to reverse their transgender-inclusive bathroom policies or face potential enforcement action. The department's Office of Civil Rights found the districts to be in violation of Title IX, citing a Supreme Court ruling that distinguishes between gender identity and biological sex. The districts are required to rescind policies allowing access based on gender identity and adopt biology-based definitions for sex-separated facilities, or risk consequences including a referral to the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funds to states, reversing an earlier decision to freeze the congressionally approved money. The administration had initially withheld the funds, claiming they were being misused to "subsidize a radical left-wing agenda." The move triggered widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback from lawmakers, including 10 Republican senators who urged the administration to release the money. The funds support programs such as educator training, arts education, and after-school initiatives.</p>

          <p>Two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been placed on administrative leave, sparking speculation of political retaliation. The officials, Jeff Dillen and Stephen Volz, led the 2020 investigation into "Sharpiegate," which found that top agency brass violated scientific integrity by altering a hurricane forecast to align with President Trump's incorrect statements. The move comes just days before the former NOAA chief at the center of the scandal is set to face a confirmation hearing to lead the agency again.</p>

This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions freely without the risk of her statements being used against her, a common practice when prosecutors are seeking cooperation. Maxwell reportedly initiated the meetings and spoke for about nine hours over two days. The arrangement has drawn criticism from one of her victims, who questioned why a convicted sex trafficker was being given such a high-level audience.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese citizens are participating in a large-scale and controversial recall vote targeting more than 30 lawmakers, primarily from the opposition Kuomintang party, who are accused of being too close to China. The "Great Recall" movement grew out of protests against the opposition-dominated legislature, which has blocked bills from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Pro-recall activists believe the opposition is being influenced by Beijing, a claim the Kuomintang denies, while opponents of the recall accuse the DPP of trying to undemocratically seize legislative power.</p>

The sheriff's office admitted to a "clerical error" and "human error" where deputies failed to properly verify an inmate's identity, releasing a man held on serious charges instead of another inmate who had posted bond. The local district attorney's office called the incident an "unacceptable lapse" that highlights "ongoing systemic issues" at the facility.
