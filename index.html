          <p>An inquest jury has ruled that a 14-year-old girl, Ruth Szymankiewicz, was unlawfully killed at the since-closed Huntercombe Hospital in Berkshire. She was left unsupervised for 15 minutes by a staff member on his first shift who had used fraudulent credentials. The jury cited insufficient staff training and unsuitable care conditions as contributing factors to her death in February 2022. Her parents stated the system meant to care for their daughter ultimately harmed her, leaving a permanent void in their family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's are reporting a slowdown in breakfast sales, which they attribute to economic anxiety among low-income customers. As discretionary spending tightens due to inflation and a weaker job market, breakfast is often the first meal consumers choose to skip or eat at home. This trend is seen by economists as an indicator of broader financial stress, even as some chains like Starbucks and Dunkin' report continued success. The article suggests businesses are currently absorbing tariff costs, but may soon pass them on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a looming judicial decision on antitrust remedies, AI startup Perplexity has made a public offer to buy Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. This comes after a court ruled Google holds a search monopoly, and the Department of Justice has advocated for divesting Chrome to increase competition. While analysts find Perplexity's offer unserious, it highlights the immense pressure on Google and its parent company, Alphabet, to potentially break up its assets. The article explores analyst valuations for Alphabet's various divisions, including YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo, in the event of a forced restructuring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of a meeting in Alaska with Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump stated he believes a deal to end the war in Ukraine is possible. He described the initial summit as a precursor to a second, more crucial meeting that would include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to finalize an agreement. Trump acknowledged a 25% chance of failure but expressed hope, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio tempered expectations, suggesting a long-term resolution would take more time. The Kremlin has warned against predicting the summit's outcome, and Zelenskyy has expressed skepticism about Russia's willingness to end the conflict.</p>

While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S., its long-term path remains uncertain. The Atlantic hurricane season is predicted to be above-normal this year, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasting between 13 and 18 named storms.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose by 0.9% in July, significantly exceeding the 0.2% forecast and marking the largest monthly increase since June 2022. This unexpected spike suggests that inflationary pressures may still be a significant threat to the U.S. economy. While consumer price inflation has been more moderate, the strong PPI data could indicate that businesses are absorbing rising costs, including from tariffs, which may eventually be passed on to consumers. The report has slightly dampened market optimism for multiple Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has unveiled a controversial plan for nearly 3,500 new settlement homes in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank. The stated goal of the project is to "bury the idea of a Palestinian state" by effectively dividing the West Bank, a move that has drawn widespread condemnation. The announcement is seen as a direct response to several Western nations planning to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Palestinian officials and international actors, including Qatar and Egypt, have denounced the plan as a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace.</p>

The recognition is conditional on Hamas being disarmed and excluded from governance, which is seen as unrealistic given Hamas's continued popularity among Palestinians. The gesture is viewed as a return to the failed Oslo-era framework, driven by a hope to quell domestic unrest in the West rather than resolve the Middle East conflict.</p>

          <p>In a break from tradition, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic and Paralympic Games will allow corporate sponsors to purchase naming rights for its venues. This historic agreement between the LA28 organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee reverses a long-standing "clean venue" policy that prohibited commercial names on competition sites. The move is expected to generate significant additional revenue to help cover the privately funded Games' $7.1 billion budget. Existing venues like the Honda Center will be able to retain their names if their sponsors sign on as top-tier Olympic partners.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tax Bill Adds Complexity to Roth IRA Conversion Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could complicate the decision to perform a Roth IRA conversion, according to financial experts. The legislation made lower income tax rates permanent but introduced several temporary, income-limited deductions, such as a $6,000 break for older Americans. While these new deductions create more room in lower tax brackets for conversions, incurring too much income from a conversion could reduce or eliminate eligibility for these same tax breaks. Financial planners advise a careful, multi-year analysis to determine the optimal strategy, weighing the immediate tax cost against future tax-free growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Kim, a former executive at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, has been indicted on fraud charges for allegedly misappropriating nearly $4 million from investors in his online casino startup. Prosecutors claim Kim raised funds for his company, Zero Edge, but instead of developing the app, he gambled away most of the money on another crypto casino site within a week. Kim allegedly told investors he lost the money due to a "treasury management strategy" rather than admitting to his personal gambling. The company, which received investment from Kim's former employer Galaxy Digital, never launched and entered liquidation last year. (not investment advice)</p>
