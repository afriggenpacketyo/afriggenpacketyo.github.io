            <p>With measles outbreaks making headlines, experts are addressing common questions about the disease, its symptoms, and prevention through vaccination. The largest outbreak this year is in West Texas, primarily affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers, and cases have been reported in over 20 other states. Measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis, and experts emphasize that the MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective, with two doses providing 97% protection. Health officials are concerned about declining vaccination rates and urge individuals to ensure they are vaccinated, especially before the summer travel season.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods, the highest in the new trade plan, is unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia. Manufacturers are instead looking at other countries like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, and India to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. The Cambodian government is considering fiscal policies like tax credits to alleviate the pressure, but no new orders are being placed due to uncertainty. Supply chain experts warn that relocating supply chains is a major investment and companies will likely wait to see how other countries respond to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A recent surge in aggressive behavior from sea lions along the Southern California coast is attributed to domoic acid toxicosis, a neurological condition caused by harmful algal blooms. Multiple incidents have been reported, including a surfer and a teenage lifeguard trainee being bitten by sea lions exhibiting unusual aggression. Experts emphasize that these animals are not naturally aggressive, but the toxins affect their behavior, causing disorientation and seizures. The Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles is treating affected animals, highlighting the need for awareness and caution around marine life during algal blooms.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs impacting global trade, including a baseline 10% tariff on most foreign imports to the U.S. and customized tariffs for countries deemed "worst offenders".

Canada and Mexico are exempt from the baseline rate, and the White House claims the tariffs are necessary to address trade imbalances and protect American jobs.

While Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have not yet adjusted their forecasts, they have warned of increasing downside risks. China's official growth target for 2025 is "around 5%," but analysts suggest that achieving this goal will be challenging given the current trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Trevor McFadden stated that the White House's actions violated the First Amendment, emphasizing that the government cannot restrict access to journalists based on their viewpoints.

            <p>A hit-and-run on the 134 Freeway in Eagle Rock led to a manhunt and a shooting that wounded one person, resulting in the arrest of three suspects. The incident began with a three-vehicle crash on the freeway, and as authorities searched for the fleeing suspects, gunshots were reported at a nearby home. Police are investigating who opened fire, and the California Highway Patrol confirmed it was not involved in the shooting. The freeway closure caused significant traffic delays.</p>

The city, which relies heavily on Canadian tourism, aims to reassure visitors that they are welcome despite the U.S. government's tariffs and rhetoric. Canadian visitors contribute an estimated $300 million annually to the region, supporting thousands of jobs in the hospitality industry. Local businesses are also taking steps to show their support, with one carwash installing a "We Love Canada" sign.</p>

            <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has sparked a legal battle over immigration due process. Despite a court order for his return, the Trump administration argues it cannot compel El Salvador to release him, raising concerns about the rule of law in immigration processes. Immigration experts argue that the administration's position could undermine due process for immigrants, as it could allow the government to deport individuals without repercussions. The Supreme Court is considering the matter, with implications for immigration enforcement and the rights of immigrants.</p>

The robust number of applications has raised the possibility that the state will exhaust the available $100 million in funding for the first year of the program. The CHOOSE Act will provide eligible families with as much as $7,000 in state money through education savings accounts for private school tuition or costs at a participating school. Critics say the program drains money from public schools to help families who may have already decided to enroll their children in a private school.</p>
