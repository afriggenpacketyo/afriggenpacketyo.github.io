          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, stating that both nations agreed to halt strikes. The Israeli government confirmed its coordination with Trump and adherence to the ceasefire, warning of forceful responses to any violations. Iranian state television also reported the ceasefire's commencement, though an Iranian Foreign Minister suggested there was no formal agreement but that Iran would cease strikes if Israel did the same. The conflict, initiated by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, led to casualties on both sides and U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear sites. Qatar helped broker the deal after direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.</p>

          <p>Boy and girl scouts in Kyoto participated in harvesting "Ofuku Ume" plums at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine, known for producing these Japanese plums believed to bring good luck in the New Year. Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, plucked the ripe plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. The harvested plums are pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, and drinking tea made from them on New Year's Day is believed to promote good health and ward off illness. The scouts expressed their enjoyment of the activity and hoped that everyone would enjoy the plums.</p>

          <p>A report assessing the health of the US population overlooks the leading causes of death for American children: gun violence and road traffic accidents. While the report focuses on obesity, mental health, and chronic disease, it fails to address the disproportionately high rates of child fatalities from firearms and vehicle collisions compared to other developed countries. The article emphasizes the need for public health agencies to acknowledge these issues and implement policies to reduce gun violence and improve road safety, drawing comparisons with countries that have prioritized health and well-being through stricter regulations.</p>

The plan allocates 3.5% to core defense and 1.5% to resilience measures like border security and cyber attack protection. The government expects to reach 4.1% by 2027, with core defense spending at 2.6% by then, but has not detailed how the 3.5% target will be funded by 2035.</p>

          <p>The number of students enrolled in Japanese schools in China has decreased by over 10% in the academic year starting April, marking the first anniversary of a knife attack near Shanghai that injured Japanese nationals. This decline is attributed to an economic downturn in China and safety concerns among Japanese expatriate communities following the knife attack and a fatal stabbing of a Japanese boy. Security measures have been increased at Japanese schools in Suzhou, but parents remain vigilant and express concerns about potential risks to their children.</p>

          <p>Global equities experienced slight gains as investors reacted to President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, coupled with growing weariness towards Trump's policymaking. The article suggests that the markets are becoming desensitized to policy changes, with the Iranian response to U.S. strikes being relatively subdued. It notes that the markets are muted because there are elements of the market getting jaded at Trump policy changes and how the Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities was largely subdued. After the wild swings from changes to tariff policy in April, each successive change has seen less of a move.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, along with U.S. military strikes, may result in greater disruptions for Western airlines compared to their Chinese counterparts. While most carriers are avoiding dangerous airspace, Western firms are disadvantaged because they remain barred from Russian airspace, which Chinese companies continue to utilize. This situation could widen the competitive gap that Chinese airlines already have over others, particularly for travelers from China, who prioritize airfare and flight times.</p>

          <p>The Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in the Hebrides after owning it for 80 years, listing the property for £5.5 million. The island, which includes a ruined castle, working farm, and holiday accommodation business, has been the family's home since 1945. The island's white sand beaches and rocky coves provided an idyllic childhood for the family. The castle on the island was built in 1911 by a New Zealand-born adventurer, but fell into ruins in the 1980s due to high upkeep costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is facing questions about its ability to meet a potential NATO defense spending target of 5% of GDP, which would require significant increases in annual expenditures. While Germany spent around 2% of its GDP on defense in 2024, reaching the 5% goal would necessitate additional tens of billions of euros each year. Experts suggest that these expenses may need to be financed through loans, budget cuts, and tax increases. The country's recent fiscal U-turn, allowing for defense expenditures above a certain threshold to be exempt from debt limitations, provides short-term flexibility but could lead to higher interest costs in the medium term.</p>

The Hillsborough Law aims to prevent cover-ups and ensure accountability in major disasters, but concerns have arisen that the proposed legislation may fall short of its intended goals.</p>
