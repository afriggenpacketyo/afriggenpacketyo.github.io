          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs on goods from more than 90 nations have officially commenced, aiming to reshape global trade dynamics. These levies, which President Trump claims will bring billions into the US, range up to 40% for manufacturing-focused countries like Laos and Myanmar. While some major economies like the UK and the EU have secured lower rates through negotiations, others such as India face potential increases for their trade with Russia. The move seeks to pressure companies into boosting US investment and alter trade systems the administration views as unfair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor reported an 11% year-on-year drop in operating profit for the June quarter, attributing 450 billion yen in losses directly to US tariffs. Despite beating revenue and profit estimates, the world's largest automaker has revised its full-year operating income forecast downward by 600 billion yen. The results reflect broader challenges for Japanese carmakers, who have been absorbing the costs of a 25% US import tariff to maintain market share. While a new US-Japan trade deal is expected to lower tariffs, the strong yen and existing costs continue to pressure earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists at Harvard University are warning that critical research into diseases like multiple sclerosis and cancer could be delayed for years due to a federal funding freeze. The Trump administration cut an estimated $2.6 billion in funding as part of a dispute over the university's handling of alleged antisemitism on campus. Researchers have been forced to lay off staff and shelve projects, with some fearing their work may never resume. While Harvard has pledged its own funds to mitigate the impact, the scientific community is concerned about long-term damage to US research leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy faces a significant challenge after the US imposed a 50% tariff on its goods, partly due to its oil trade with Russia. While only about 2% of India's GDP is tied to US exports, specific sectors like gems, jewelry, textiles, and chemicals are highly vulnerable, with an estimated $8 billion in exports at risk. Analysts note that key sectors such as IT services and pharmaceuticals, which are major exports to the US, are not targeted by the current duties on goods. The immediate economic impact has been felt through a weaker rupee and increased currency volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

Known for his avant-garde style, Palmieri was the first Latino artist to win a Grammy in 1975 for his album “The Sun of Latin Music” and earned seven more throughout his career. He rose to prominence in the 1960s with his band La Perfecta, which was distinguished by its unique trombone-led sound instead of traditional trumpets. Palmieri's influential work, which fused salsa, funk, soul, and jazz, has left a lasting legacy on the landscape of Afro-Caribbean music.</p>

The election is seen as a critical moment that will determine whether Moldova continues its path toward European integration or falls under the influence of a pro-Russian alliance.

Edwards expressed surprise that the record still stands, suggesting it may not be a healthy sign for the sport given advances in science and training. He believes part of the reason is that track and field, particularly field events, doesn't offer the same financial rewards as other sports, deterring young talent. Experts also note that modern shoe technology, which benefits runners, may not provide the same advantage for the extreme forces involved in jumping events.</p>

          <p>Nearly 200 days into his presidency, Donald Trump's repeated vow to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours is being tested by complex diplomatic maneuvering. A potential meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin is now considered a “good prospect” following what a US envoy described as “great progress” in talks with Moscow. However, it remains unclear what this progress entails and whether Russia is genuinely inclined toward a ceasefire that Ukraine would find acceptable. The developments suggest a potential shift in the conflict, though a resolution remains highly uncertain and dependent on the undisclosed terms of the negotiations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency is introducing enhanced checks on tyre exports following a BBC investigation that revealed millions were being sent to illegal furnaces in India instead of being recycled. The agency acknowledged it is “highly likely” that a portion of UK tyres are diverted to makeshift pyrolysis plants, which cause severe environmental damage and health risks. While campaigners welcomed the move, they expressed disappointment that the government did not implement a full ban on whole-tyre exports. The new regulations, effective October 1, will require exporters to provide better verification that waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner.</p>

The analysis found that expensive, powerful vehicles and pickup trucks are common targets for thieves. The Camaro models are particularly vulnerable due to an on-board data port that can be exploited for theft. In contrast, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in garages and are more easily traceable.</p>

          <p>Actor Dean Cain, known for playing Superman in the 1990s, appeared in a social media video encouraging followers to join the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. In his post, Cain claimed ICE arrests dangerous criminals, though data shows most detainees have no criminal convictions. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security used an image from an upcoming “South Park” episode showing characters in ICE gear for its own recruitment post on X. The show, which has been sharply critical of the Trump administration, responded satirically to the appropriation of its content.</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring less than five months after returning from a challenging test mission aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The flight, which was Starliner's first with a crew, experienced multiple thruster outages and gas leaks, extending what was meant to be an eight-day mission to over nine months in orbit. NASA ultimately deemed a return on Starliner too risky, and Wilmore returned on a SpaceX capsule. In a statement, NASA praised Wilmore’s 25 years of service and his “lasting legacy of fortitude” in advancing human spaceflight.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece questions why the discovery of microplastics in every human testicle from a recent study has not triggered widespread alarm, particularly within a patriarchal society obsessed with male virility. The author sarcastically notes that while threats to female reproductive health from plastics have been ignored, the evidence that these particles reduce sperm counts and cause inflammation in male testes should provoke “genital theft panic.” The article criticizes the petrochemical lobby for obstructing a global plastic pollution treaty, arguing that fossil fuel interests are a greater threat to male health than any feminist agenda.</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have canceled a major $3 billion coastal restoration project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing wetlands. The project would have diverted sediment from the Mississippi River to naturally create 17,000 acres of new land over 30 years, providing a critical buffer against hurricanes. The decision, directed by Governor Jeff Landry, follows strong opposition from the local fishing industry, which feared negative impacts on their livelihoods. Coastal scientists argue that canceling the project removes the best long-term solution for counteracting land loss and protecting coastal communities.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given China two weeks to clarify why significant parts of its plans for a new mega-embassy in London have been redacted. The request comes amid security concerns that the embassy's proposed location near the city's financial district could pose an espionage risk. There are also fears it could be used to harass political opponents from Hong Kong. The government has taken control of the planning decision from the local council, with a final ruling expected by September 9, as it attempts to engage with China after a period of cooler relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by World Weather Attribution scientists concludes that Pakistan's recent deadly monsoon rains were likely made 10% to 15% heavier by climate change. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, intensifying rainfall and making floods more dangerous. This year's monsoon has caused at least 300 deaths, primarily from collapsing buildings in fragile urban settlements. The findings come after catastrophic floods in 2022 killed over 1,700 people, underscoring the nation's extreme vulnerability to climate-related disasters and the urgent need for more resilient infrastructure to protect its population.</p>

          <p>Councils in inner London are set to be the biggest losers under a government plan to rebalance local authority funding, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The report found that some London boroughs could see funding drop by up to 12% after inflation. The overhaul, set to be phased in from 2026, aims to redirect a greater share of funding to more deprived areas and those with lower council tax bases. Urban areas outside the capital, such as Nottingham and Wolverhampton, along with outer London boroughs, are projected to benefit from the changes. (not investment advice)</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration issued ground stops at United's major hubs, including Chicago, Denver, and Newark, leading to significant delays and passenger disruptions. The airline stated the issue was related to its internal flight information system and was not a cybersecurity event. United confirmed the problem was resolved but warned that residual delays would persist as it worked to restore normal operations, comparing the disruption to previous meltdowns at other major carriers.</p>
