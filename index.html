          <p>Jerusalem's Latin Patriarch and Greek Orthodox Patriarch have described their profound distress after a rare visit to Gaza, where they witnessed widespread starvation and destruction. The leaders reported seeing people waiting for hours for a simple meal and children desensitized to the sound of bombing, calling the situation "morally unacceptable." Their visit followed an Israeli strike that killed three people at a Catholic church compound, an incident that has heightened tensions and drawn international attention. The patriarchs emphasized that the Christian community is suffering alongside all other Palestinians amid the severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The son of an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban for five months has expressed grave concerns that they may die in prison due to their rapidly deteriorating health. Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 76, were arrested in February while living in Afghanistan, where they ran education projects for 18 years. Their son reports his father is suffering from serious convulsions and his mother from malnutrition, with both having been held in harsh conditions without formal charges. Despite assurances from the Taliban that they are receiving medical care, the family and the UN are urgently calling for their release.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled their original trials were unfair, leading to the quashing of their sentences related to the major financial crisis-era scandal. Hayes, who served five and a half years of an 11-year sentence, described the ordeal as having "destroyed" his family and life. Following this ruling, which aligns with US courts that found no evidence of lawbreaking, other traders convicted in the UK are expected to seek similar exoneration.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that his country will not rush into a disadvantageous trade agreement with the United States, even as a deadline for new US tariffs approaches. The US has threatened a 35% tax on Canadian goods if a deal is not reached, adding to existing tariffs on products like steel and aluminum. Carney emphasized that Canada's goal is a deal that serves the best interests of its citizens and hinted at potential protectionist measures to support affected industries. The standoff is part of a broader, disruptive tariff program by the US administration, which argues the measures protect American jobs.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence sector saw a massive influx of capital in the first half of the year, with startups raising $104.3 billion, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Major players like OpenAI and Anthropic secured historic funding rounds, indicating strong investor confidence in the technology's potential. However, the market for exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized in the same period. This disparity suggests that while vast sums are being invested into developing AI applications, investors are seeing limited returns so far, with most exits being smaller, strategic acquisitions.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has approved bipartisan legislation that could allow more people to access high-risk investments, such as private equity and hedge funds, by passing a test rather than meeting wealth thresholds. Currently, "accredited investor" status is generally limited to individuals with high incomes or a net worth over $1 million. The bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to create an exam to qualify investors based on financial knowledge instead of wealth alone. While proponents argue this creates equal opportunity, some financial advisors express concern that it could expose less financially secure individuals to unsuitable risks.

Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being repurposed as an Arctic whaling vessel. Researchers used dendrochronology and archival evidence, supported by a significant community effort from the island's 500 residents, to uncover its identity. The 12-ton oak timbers, uncovered by a storm after 250 years, are now being preserved, highlighting a powerful collaboration between scientists and the local community.</p>

          <p>China has established a near-monopoly on the refining of rare earth elements, critical components for modern electronics and defense systems, giving it significant leverage in global trade. This dominance was achieved over decades through strategic learning from US operations, state-sponsored consolidation of the industry, and enduring severe environmental costs from unregulated mining. After facing issues with domestic price wars and pollution, Beijing consolidated hundreds of small firms into six state-controlled giants, allowing it to control supply and price. This control has prompted a renewed push in the U.S. to rebuild its own rare earth supply chain to counter China's strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Heathrow Airport, Thomas Woldbye, has expressed frustration that he slept through emergency notifications during a fire in March that caused a massive power outage, leading to 1,300 flight cancellations. Woldbye's phone was in silent mode, causing him to miss calls as the crisis unfolded, though he stated that the airport's operational team made the correct decisions in his absence. The fire originated from a known fault at a National Grid substation that had not been fixed since 2018. Heathrow is now considering legal action against National Grid for the failure, which contributed to a 37% drop in the airport's pre-tax profits.</p>

The fee is set to increase from 7 euros to 20 euros ($23) to cover inflation and operational costs. The ETIAS program, repeatedly postponed and now expected to launch in late 2026, will apply to travelers from 59 places, including the U.S., U.K., and Canada, for short stays. The proposed new fee aligns with similar travel authorization costs for the U.S. and the U.K. and is now subject to a review period.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed its first wave of sanctions targeting people-smuggling networks, freezing the UK assets of 25 individuals and groups and banning them from travel to the country. The list includes suspected gang leaders, facilitators of illicit payments, and a Chinese company accused of manufacturing inflatable boats used for Channel crossings. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move a "landmark moment" in the fight against irregular migration. However, experts from Oxford University's Migration Observatory cautioned that the impact may be limited given the vast scale of smuggling operations, suggesting it is unlikely to be a "game changer."</p>

          <p>The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its safety policy to align with a presidential executive order, effectively banning transgender women from competing in women's Olympic events. While the policy document does not explicitly use the word "transgender," it references the executive order titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" and requires national governing bodies to update their own rules accordingly. The move follows a similar policy change by the NCAA and has been condemned by critics like the National Women's Law Center as sacrificing the needs of athletes for political demands and deepening polarization around the issue.</p>

          <p>A former late-night writer argues that the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is a significant loss for American comedy and public discourse, regardless of whether the motive was purely financial or political. The author contends that the timing, immediately after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's payments to Donald Trump, sends a chilling message. The piece emphasizes the vital role of late-night shows in establishing a shared reality and holding leaders accountable through humor, which relies on a foundation of truth. Losing such platforms is seen as another step toward a fragmented society where speaking truth to power becomes harder.</p>

          <p>As heat waves strain power grids, the energy-saving strategy of "precooling"—super-chilling a home during off-peak hours—is gaining attention, but its effectiveness is debated. The method involves lowering the thermostat significantly when energy is cheaper and letting the accumulated coolness ride out hotter, more expensive peak hours. While some utilities and researchers see potential benefits if a home is well-insulated, others warn it can lead to excessive energy use and higher costs. Experts agree that other measures, like keeping curtains closed and maintaining AC systems, are reliable ways to improve efficiency.</p>

This confirms long-held archaeological hunches based on female figurines found at the site.
