          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, reached space but lost control during its ninth test flight, experiencing an uncontrolled re-entry. The upper-stage vehicle suffered a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Despite this setback, the flight achieved improvements over previous tests, including a successful ascent and no significant loss of heat shield tiles during the initial phase. Elon Musk noted the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, though previous schedules have been unrealistic. The mission also flew a booster that had been used for an earlier test flight in January, important progress toward demonstrating a rocket that can be flown over and over.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment. Unemployed recent college grads now account for 12% of the rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023, despite generally having better job prospects due to their higher education. The unemployment rate among recent college grads is nearing 6%, exceeding the national average. The report attributes this rise to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech sector, which is also vulnerable to automation and AI advancements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has agreed to reduce the felony charge against L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, convicted of excessive force, to a misdemeanor. This decision comes after U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli sought a misdemeanor plea deal, causing turmoil within the U.S. attorney's office, with several prosecutors resigning. Kirk was convicted of using excessive force against Jacey Houseton, an unarmed woman, during a 2023 incident. Although the judge rejected Essayli's proposed probation sentence, Kirk could still face jail time, but the reduced charge would allow him to potentially continue a career in law enforcement.</p>

The cancellation occurred years after National Highways spent millions on purchasing properties in the path of the proposed route. Affected families express distress over the loss of their homes and the current state of the unused properties, with one family having to relocate miles away to Cumbria. More than ¬£68m had already been spent on the A1 scheme by the time it was cancelled, and that figure continues to rise by just under ¬£30,000 a month.</p>

          <h2>Met Police Chief Warns Anti-Crime Pledges Require Additional Funding</h2>

          <p>The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, warns that the government's anti-crime pledges cannot be met without significant additional funding for policing. He points to a decade of underinvestment and increasing pressures on police forces as reasons for concern. Rowley's editorial, co-written with five chief constables, highlights that police forces are overstretched and saddled with debt, broken buildings, and outdated technology. Without significant investment, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing and no halving of knife crime or violence against women and girls, all of which are government promises.</p>

          <p>Leo Terrell, a Justice Department official leading President Trump's efforts against Harvard University, says the administration intends to sue the University of California over alleged antisemitism. Terrell, who heads a multiagency task force on combating antisemitism, stated there will be massive lawsuits against the UC system and other colleges across the country. The task force has identified UCLA, USC, and UC Berkeley, along with Harvard and other campuses, for investigations, claiming these campuses have resisted task force investigators. UC has stated it is working to address antisemitism and cooperating with the administration.</p>

          <p>The proposed Fairness, Inclusion, Rehabilitation, and Expungement for Incarcerated Firefighters Act (FIRE Act) seeks to create a pathway for former inmate firefighters to secure long-term employment. The act would fund job training, workplace opportunities, and mentoring for former inmate firefighters, and would also offer a path to expunge their criminal records. Incarcerated firefighters make up a significant portion of California's wildfire crews, earning low wages while risking their lives. The act would provide $20 million annually for states to adopt safety and wage compliance, and expand occupational safety coverage for incarcerated firefighters.</p>

          <p>President Trump will issue a full pardon to reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of financial fraud and tax evasion. The Chrisleys were found guilty of defrauding banks of over $30 million and evading taxes to support a lavish lifestyle. Their conviction exemplified the weaponization of justice against conservatives and public figures, according to their lawyer. The pardon aligns with Mr. Trump's pattern of using clemency to address perceived political injustices.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disappointment with the price tag of the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House and backed by President Trump. Musk stated that the bill increases the budget deficit, undermining the work being done by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The legislation, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boost border security spending but is projected to increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034. Musk has previously dialed back his involvement in government after a period of heavy involvement in the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed US embassies to stop scheduling appointments for student visas as it prepares to expand social media vetting of applicants. The pause will last until further guidance is issued, and is part of the White House's escalating battle with America's elite colleges. The administration believes some colleges have enabled antisemitism on campus and uphold discriminatory admissions policies. A diplomatic cable also said the state department was preparing for an "expansion of required social media screening and vetting" applicable to all student visa applications.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The study, involving nearly 200,000 mothers, found that the percentage who rated their mental health as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù dropped sharply, while the percentage reporting poor mental health increased. The researchers attribute this decline to factors such as high housing costs, increasing child care costs, soaring food prices, and the lack of national paid parental leave. Mental health experts suggest the findings may also reflect a growing willingness among mothers to discuss their struggles.</p>
