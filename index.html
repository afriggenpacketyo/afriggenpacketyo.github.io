          <p>Authorities apprehended Vance Luther Boelter, the suspect in the killing of Minnesota Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in what was called a "politically motivated assassination." Boelter, 57, was taken into custody after a massive manhunt. He also allegedly shot Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack Saturday morning, and the couple is in stable condition. Authorities located what they believe to be the suspect's vehicle in Sibley County, Minnesota, about an hour outside of Minneapolis.</p>

          <p>As missile exchanges continue between Israel and Iran, European leaders are seeking clarity from Donald Trump on his Iran strategy, particularly whether he will urge a ceasefire or allow the conflict to continue. Trump predicted "peace soon" between Israel and Iran, echoing his earlier claim about resolving the Russia-Ukraine war. He told reporters before leaving for the G7 summit in Canada that he hopes for a deal, adding that "sometimes they have to fight it out." The United States had planned talks with Iran on its nuclear program, but these were canceled after Israel's assault.</p>

          <p>Discontent is growing in the Tokyo metropolitan area over proposals to construct large data centers in residential areas, prompting industry groups to address local concerns about the facilities' imposing nature. Some projects are being scrapped due to resident opposition, citing worries about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstructed natural light. One residential association is demanding a project be paused until it conforms to city ordinances, while another city was flooded with calls of concern when plans were revealed for a data center in a prime location. Municipalities are starting to require earlier construction notices and clear indications of heat-emitting units to address these issues.</p>

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Israel took unilateral action without U.S. support and warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests.

Maresca, who previously coached Delap at Manchester City's academy, believes Delap's familiarity with their playing style will be an advantage.

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest pace since late 2023, boosted by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates, while industrial output growth slowed slightly. Fixed-asset investment expanded 3.7% year-to-date, but property investment contraction deepened. The urban survey-based unemployment rate fell to 5.0%, the lowest since November, and this rise in retail sales came as a surprise, likely boosted by the lasting effects from the consumer goods trade-in program.</p>
