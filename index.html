          <p>President Trump suggested he might reduce tariffs on China to 80% before trade talks in Switzerland, a move that could signal a shift in his approach to the trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators to discuss potential agreements. The U.S. currently has tariffs of 145% on imports from China, while China has retaliated with a 125% levy on American goods. Trump's comments come after announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, raising hopes for progress with other major trading partners.</p>

          <p>House and Senate Democrats are urging the Trump administration to use the designation of Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations to curb the flow of American-made guns into Mexico.
