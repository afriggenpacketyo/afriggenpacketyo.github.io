          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The appointment follows the controversial firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed slower-than-expected hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodologies and data, a stance that has drawn support from figures like Steve Bannon but has raised concerns among some economists about the potential politicization of the agency. The nomination requires Senate confirmation to proceed.</p>

          <p>Following a prolonged legal fight with media organizations, the Uvalde, Texas school district has released a trove of records related to the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting. The documents include text messages, personnel files, and the shooter's student records, offering further insight into the heavily criticized law enforcement response. The release comes after a Texas appeals court upheld a ruling mandating public access to the materials.

          <p>A two-year-old child was found wandering alone and barefoot on a railroad overpass in Needles, California, leading to the arrest of her parents. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department responded to a report early Sunday morning and located the toddler. The parents, identified as Bradley Underwood and Sara Estrada, arrived at the scene and were found to be intoxicated from a stimulant. They were arrested on suspicion of child abuse, and the child was placed in the custody of Child and Family Services.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, suspending mutual tariffs for an additional 90 days. President Trump confirmed the extension via an executive order just hours before the previous agreement was set to expire, with China's Commerce Ministry announcing a reciprocal suspension. This move averts, for now, the re-imposition of steep tariffs that had reached as high as 145% on Chinese goods. The temporary pause in the trade conflict provides continued stability for global markets while negotiations continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a significant heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34°C (93°F) in southern and central England. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts, warning of potential travel disruption and increased strain on health services. Concurrently, the national drought group has declared that England is facing "nationally significant" water shortfalls, impacting agriculture, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. The extreme heat is being driven by warm air from continental Europe, where other countries have also set record temperatures.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned President Trump that California may redraw its own congressional maps to counteract a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas. The warning comes as Texas Democrats continue to block the new map by denying the state legislature a quorum, with many lawmakers having left the state. Newsom characterized the Texas plan as an affront to democracy and stated that while he prefers independent commissions, California cannot stand by during a "power grab." This escalates the partisan "redistricting arms race" spreading across the country.</p>

The final score was 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 7-6 (7-5) in favor of the defending champion. Raducanu's ability to push the top-ranked player to a final-set tiebreak is another positive sign in her continued revival this season. Her improved fitness and resilience have helped her climb back into the world's top 40, building momentum ahead of the upcoming US Open.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue their partnership with Netflix under a new multi-year, first-look deal for their Archewell Productions company. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed content and covered overhead costs. The couple has produced several successful documentary series for the streamer, including "Harry & Meghan." The extended partnership will also support Meghan's lifestyle brand, "As ever," which was developed in collaboration with Netflix.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the South Park neighborhood of downtown. The project, proposed by New York-based Mack Real Estate Development, is planned to include 536 rental units and ground-floor retail space. However, the developer has not commented on a construction timeline, reflecting a challenging financial climate for new development. High interest rates, rising material costs, and labor instability are creating significant hurdles for builders, even as demand for housing in Los Angeles remains high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of the planned meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, European Union foreign ministers have convened to stress that any peace deal regarding the war in Ukraine must involve Ukraine itself. The EU's stance reflects widespread concern that a bilateral U.S.-Russia summit could result in an agreement that undermines Ukrainian sovereignty and interests. This collective European position underscores the diplomatic rift created by Trump's approach to the conflict. The article also tragically notes the killing of an Al Jazeera journalist in Gaza.</p>

Many, however, remain skeptical, questioning whether the deployment will be effective or simply create more chaos.

          <p>President Trump has announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, directly overriding a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would face a 39% duty, causing the precious metal to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on social media, gold futures dropped significantly. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had warned that the tariffs could negatively impact the international flow of physical gold, a concern now alleviated by the president's intervention.
