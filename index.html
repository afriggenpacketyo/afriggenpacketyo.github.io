In response to the news, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, while government bond yields continued to climb, reflecting ongoing investor concerns. Analysts predict a period of extended political and fiscal uncertainty for Japan as the country's ruling party prepares to select a new leader. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that President Donald Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska gave the Russian leader exactly what he wanted: a high-profile meeting to project strength on the world stage. Speaking to ABC News, Zelenskyy expressed regret that Ukraine was not involved and asserted that Putin avoids meeting with him while actively seeking audiences with the U.S. president. His comments came just before Russia launched a record assault of over 800 drones and munitions across Ukraine.</p>

The final match was delayed by approximately half an hour due to enhanced security measures for President Donald Trump, who attended the event and watched from a luxury suite. Trump's presence drew a mixed reaction of cheers and boos from the crowd, and the U.S. Tennis Association reportedly issued guidance to broadcasters to avoid showcasing off-court disruptions.</p>

This call comes as other powerful unions, like Unite, express deep dissatisfaction and consider severing their long-standing financial and political ties with the Labour Party.</p>

Bayrou's gamble was intended to force parliamentary backing for an austerity budget aimed at controlling France's massive national debt. The crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election, which resulted in a fragmented parliament with no clear majority, making it nearly impossible to govern effectively.</p>

          <p>Superchief Gallery, an independent art space in downtown Los Angeles known for its focus on counterculture, may be forced to close its doors this month due to financial hardship. The gallery's co-founder cited a decline in both art sales and corporate sponsorships, reflecting a broader downturn in the global art market and the slow post-pandemic recovery of many downtown businesses. A crowdfunding campaign has helped, but it has not been enough to cover the monthly expenses for the large venue.</p>

          <p>Florida's controversial plan to become the first state to make some school vaccinations voluntary will not take effect for approximately 90 days, according to the state health department. The initial rule change targets mandates for diseases like chickenpox and hepatitis B, while requirements for polio and measles will remain in place unless lawmakers pass new legislation. The move by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo has drawn widespread criticism from medical experts who warn it will endanger public health.</p>

O'Neill lamented his team's lack of depth and questioned a key free-kick decision that led to Germany's third goal, but acknowledged the difficulty of the away fixture.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that his agency could be forced to issue massive refunds, potentially up to $1 trillion, if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs." An appeals court recently ruled that most of the tariffs are illegal, a decision the Trump administration is appealing with a request for an expedited hearing. While Bessent stated he is confident the administration will win, he acknowledged the significant financial disruption a negative ruling would cause for the U.S. Treasury. (not investment advice)</p>

As the United States attempts to fragment its global ties, Goldin suggests that the world is seeing a more regionalized form of globalisation centered on Asia.</p>
