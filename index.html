          <p>Vice President JD Vance traveled to Los Angeles as protests continued against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Vance toured a Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center, meeting with leadership and Marines. The visit occurred amidst clashes between protestors and law enforcement over ICE raids and deportations, a central part of President Trump's agenda. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump could keep the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell protests, a decision Trump hailed as a significant victory. The Vice President has previously criticized the protests and advocated for the passage of legislation to secure the border. Optimism surrounding the protests, the deployment of the National Guard, and the legislative agenda remains low.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has provided information and support to over 25,000 people seeking guidance regarding the security situation in Israel, the West Bank, and Iran. The department encouraged Americans seeking help leaving the region to complete an online crisis intake form. The State Department is not anticipating direct U.S. government-assisted departure from Iran, advising Americans to use existing means to leave. President Trump dismissed his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, saying she was "wrong" when she testified in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon, marking the second time in a week the president has dismissed the assessment of the intelligence director he selected. The United States continues to monitor the safety of its citizens amidst the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil to be released on bail, more than three months after he was detained by ICE. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to his community, allowing his release during immigration proceedings. Khalil's arrest, stemming from his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, sparked demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. The government initially invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but later cited failure to disclose information on his residency application as the reason for detention. The judge expressed skepticism of the government's requests to keep Khalil detained, paving the way for his reunion with his family.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intense heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms. The warning covers parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is in place, warning of pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with health conditions. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires across England and Wales, prompting calls for caution when using barbecues and handling flammable objects. While the heatwave is record-breaking for 2025, temperatures are still below the June peak of 1976.</p>

          <p>Kroger plans to close 60 of its supermarkets across the U.S. over the next 18 months, representing about 5% of its Kroger-branded stores. The grocery retailer did not specify which store locations would be affected. The announcement came as Kroger reported its first-quarter earnings, with sales dropping slightly to $45.1 billion. The company expects the store closures to provide a modest financial benefit, with resulting savings invested in customer experience initiatives. Kroger stated that all employees at affected stores will be offered roles at other Kroger locations.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip expected on June 28. The initial rollout will feature a limited number of Model Y vehicles and access will be by invitation only. Trips to or from airports are excluded, service may be limited due to bad weather, and a Tesla Safety Monitor will sit in the front passenger seat. The rides are limited to a geofenced area of the city and remote drivers will monitor as a backup. Despite previous delays, Wall Street analysts believe robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, though setbacks are expected.</p>

The article highlights several instances where Trump used the two-week deadline, including Russia's war in Ukraine, decisions about tariffs, and healthcare plans.

Abston admitted to researching Young's address and stated he went to the mayor's house to confront him about crime in Memphis, armed with a Taser.

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated 639 employees at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent organization, USAGM, in the latest round of sweeping cuts. This action represents the near-complete dismantling of an organization founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda, reducing it to just 250 employees. Kari Lake, Trump's senior advisor to USAGM, stated that the cuts were intended to end decades of dysfunction and bias. The cuts represent a major retreat from America’s Cold War strategy of using broadcasting to reach audiences living under authoritarian rule, and the layoffs came just days after VOA recalled Farsi-speaking journalists to cover the war between Israel and Iran.</p>

Tate maintains that as an American man using an American platform in Dubai, he is not subject to Romania's 'no campaigning' law.

          <p>Meta approached artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI about a potential takeover bid before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI. The two companies did not finalize a deal, with sources indicating that the talks were either mutually dissolved or that Perplexity walked away. Meta's attempt to purchase Perplexity is seen as part of Mark Zuckerberg's efforts to bolster his company's AI capabilities amid competition from OpenAI and Google, as he seeks to hire top AI talent and advance Meta's position in the AI landscape.</p>

          <p>A grand jury in Colorado has indicted Barry Morphew for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were found more than three years after she went missing. Barry Morphew was previously charged with her murder in 2021, but those charges were dropped just before trial. Suzanne Morphew's body was found in September 2023, and her death was ruled a homicide caused by intoxication from a combination of drugs used to sedate animals. The indictment alleges that Barry Morphew, a former deer farmer, had access to these drugs and that his statements to law enforcement were inconsistent with other evidence.</p>

          <p>A key vaccine advisory panel reconstituted by health secretary and vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr. is set to discuss thimerosal-containing influenza vaccines in its first meeting. Thimerosal, an ethylmercury preservative used in multi-dose vaccine vials, has been a focus of anti-vaccine activists for decades despite studies deeming it safe. The panel will hold separate votes on "influenza vaccines" and influenza vaccines that contain thimerosal. Experts worry that the discussion of thimerosal is geared towards making vaccines less affordable, less accessible, and more feared, while others criticize Kennedy's actions as a coup against the independent panel.</p>

The court did not rule on the suit itself, but said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state's rule.

Despite the diplomatic efforts, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, remains the ultimate decision-maker, and it's unclear whether the Israeli airstrikes will move him closer to a diplomatic resolution. The ongoing Israeli assault may also make Khamenei fearful about communicating, given concerns about avoiding signals intelligence intercepts.</p>

          <p>Florian Wirtz, a top Bundesliga performer at age 22, is potentially transferring to Liverpool, raising questions about his fit within the team's existing roster. Wirtz, a dynamic playmaker, excels as a number 10, possessing pace, awareness, and decision-making abilities. His best position is that number 10 central role, and his addition could require a reshuffling of Liverpool's lineup. The arrival of Wirtz could impact the playing time of players like Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister, while Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz appear secure in their wide positions. The team may also explore a 4-3-3 formation with Wirtz as a false nine.</p>
