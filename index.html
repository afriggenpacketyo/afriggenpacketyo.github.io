          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta infringed upon the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that Meta's action lacked a clear justification and that the company applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling orders Meta to revise its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions. This decision highlights a growing trend in South America where courts are holding social media platforms more accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>England and Scotland are set to face each other in a Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final, renewing a rivalry that has been overwhelmingly dominated by England for over 25 years. Scotland's last victory against the Red Roses was in 1999, with the gap between the teams widening since then due to England's superior investment, structure, and larger player pool. Despite the historical dominance, Scotland has shown significant improvement, rising to sixth in world rankings. This article explores the history of the matchup and the factors contributing to the current disparity, while noting the Scottish team's belief in their ability to challenge the tournament favorites.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided on the outcome of the highly anticipated match between Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez and Terence “Bud” Crawford, highlighting a classic clash of power versus technical skill. Crawford's supporters believe his superior boxing intelligence, adaptability, and reach advantage will allow him to outpoint Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those backing Álvarez argue that his size, power, and experience at the 168lb limit will prove insurmountable for Crawford. The fight's intrigue lies in whether Crawford's flawless technique can overcome the significant physical advantages held by the Mexican superstar.</p>

          <p>A Turkish prosecutor has ordered the detention of 48 individuals, including Hasan Mutlu, the opposition-run Bayrampasa district mayor in Istanbul, as part of a widespread corruption probe. The investigation involves allegations of embezzlement, bribery, and tender rigging, with police conducting raids across 72 locations. Mayor Mutlu, a member of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), has dismissed the investigation as a politically motivated operation based on slander. The detentions occur amid a sustained legal crackdown on the CHP, raising concerns about the state of democratic institutions in the country.</p>

          <p>Officials in Downing Street and the Foreign Office were reportedly aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended him in Parliament. While sources indicate Starmer himself was not briefed on the email contents, the information had been passed to No 10 after a media inquiry. The emails, which revealed a closer relationship than previously known, led to Mandelson's swift dismissal as the UK's ambassador to the US.

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the collapse of the government, Nepal has sworn in former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. The youth-led "GenZ" demonstrations, which saw the parliament set ablaze, were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations. With Karki's appointment, calm has returned to Kathmandu, and new elections have been scheduled for March 5. Her leadership is seen as a step toward stability and addressing the graft concerns that fueled the widespread public unrest.</p>

Initially targeting 20 researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to alleviate the professional challenges women face after childbirth.

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill that would ban most law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identity while on duty. The measure, which now heads to Governor Gavin Newsom, was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where agents covered their faces. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for public trust and accountability, preventing fear and potential impersonation, especially after a Supreme Court ruling allowing certain profiling tactics. However, law enforcement agencies and Republican lawmakers oppose the bill, citing officer safety concerns.</p>

His long absence from the major US market has been conspicuous, coinciding with sexual assault allegations that emerged in 2017, which he has always denied. A potential friendly match between Portugal and the US next year is seen as a test of the waters. The piece suggests a changing political climate under Donald Trump, who has shown admiration for Ronaldo, might facilitate this return, which would be a major branding opportunity for both the player and FIFA.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Rebecca Solnit uses the recently released 2003 Jeffrey Epstein birthday album as a lens to examine the historical normalization of sexual exploitation of young girls. Solnit argues that the culture of the 1970s and 80s, reflected in films, music, and societal attitudes, frequently excused or even celebrated relationships between adult men and underage girls. She credits the rise of feminism with fundamentally shifting public consciousness by establishing principles of consent, power dynamics, and the rights of women and children. The article posits that Epstein's actions were a product of an era before these feminist ideas became mainstream.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins' football season has fallen into a deeper crisis following a 35-10 home loss to New Mexico, marking their third consecutive defeat. The team, which was heavily favored, looked outmatched on both offense and defense, falling behind early and never holding a lead. This loss raises serious questions about the team's direction under second-year coach DeShaun Foster, as the Bruins have been outscored 108-43 this season. Despite a roster overhaul that included a star transfer quarterback, the team has struggled with execution, penalties, and overall performance, facing a difficult path ahead in the Big Ten conference.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to order an airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar appears to have backfired, as the mission is believed to have failed. The strike, which killed five low-level Hamas members, did not eliminate its primary targets but has enraged Qatar, a key mediator, and strained relations with the United States. This gamble was intended to pressure Hamas and project an image of victory, but instead it has likely derailed ceasefire negotiations and endangered the remaining hostages. The incident has damaged Netanyahu's international standing without achieving its military objective.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a frustrating 5-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, ending in a 10th-inning walk-off grand slam. The defeat wasted a brilliant performance by starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who allowed only one run over seven dominant innings. The Dodgers' offense struggled throughout the game, scoring just a single run and failing to capitalize on multiple scoring opportunities. The loss highlighted the team's ongoing inconsistency and reliance on a bullpen that has been unreliable in high-pressure situations, squandering the momentum they had built from a recent four-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the 2021 disappearance of British woman Sarm Heslop from a luxury yacht in the US Virgin Islands has stalled, with police admitting they are at a "dead end." Newly released CCTV footage shows the last known sighting of Heslop with her then-boyfriend, Ryan Bane, as they returned to his yacht. Bane, who remains a person of interest, reported her missing hours later, suggesting she fell overboard, but has never been formally questioned by police. The case is filled with inconsistencies, including a one-hour gap in the timeline and Bane's failure to follow standard maritime protocols for a person overboard.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to perform strongly in local elections in Gelsenkirchen, a traditional stronghold of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). The AfD has capitalized on local frustrations over issues like derelict housing and crime, which they link to labor migration from Southeast Europe. With polls indicating a rightward shift, the AfD's mayoral candidate has a chance to reach a runoff election, which would be a first for the party in western Germany. Local community leaders and anti-fascist groups express fear that an AfD success could lead to funding cuts for social and integration projects.</p>
