        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric targeting judges from both sides of the political aisle. Speaking at a judicial conference, he cautioned that such language could incite violence, referencing past threats against justices and a recent assassination attempt. Roberts noted he has previously felt compelled to condemn statements from both high-profile Republicans and Democrats for being inappropriate and dangerous. His remarks underscore a growing concern for judicial independence and safety amid intense political polarization.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are living together in a "virtual athletes' village" to simulate Olympic conditions and build resilience to unfamiliar environments and unexpected challenges, such as travel delays. The initiative aims to foster team unity and improve morale by having athletes live and train in close quarters. Early results from a metropolitan championship suggest the approach is helping swimmers perform well even under less-than-ideal circumstances.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters have clashed with riot police in Belgrade, Serbia, during a large anti-government rally demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. The demonstrations, led by students, have grown in recent months following a deadly railway station roof collapse that protesters attribute to government corruption. President Vucic has accused the protesters of being part of a foreign plot and has refused calls for a snap election. Organizers have warned of further radicalization, holding the government responsible for any escalation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As heatwaves become more common, cities often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island effect." Dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly and elevating temperatures, particularly at night. This effect is compounded by waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning, and a lack of cooling vegetation and water sources. With global temperatures rising and urban populations growing, cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the dangerous impacts of extreme heat.</p>

Hundreds marched through the city, arguing that the opulent event highlights the exploitation of Venice while its citizens grapple with overtourism, high living costs, and climate threats. Protesters criticized the event as an affront to the city's fragile environment and dismissed a large donation from Bezos as an attempt to "clear his conscience." The demonstration contrasted sharply with the star-studded affair, which included numerous high-profile celebrities.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, charities and dermatologists hope that instilling good habits early will help "grow skin cancer out of the next generation."</p>

The march, which celebrated human rights and solidarity, was addressed by Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, who framed the event as a peaceful show of freedom against a "hateful power." The government had tried to use a controversial 2021 "Child Protection" law to justify the ban.</p>

          <p>Following its 12-day conflict with Israel, Iran has deepened its domestic crackdown, executing several men on espionage charges and arresting hundreds accused of having ties to Israel. Human rights activists express grave concern, stating the regime has accelerated its "execution machine" and is denying defendants due to process. The government also announced new surveillance measures to monitor citizens' online activities, creating an atmosphere of fear. Many Iranians, still traumatized by the crackdown on the 2022 protests, now fear the regime will take revenge on its own people as global attention shifts elsewhere.</p>

          <p>A mother in the UK has resorted to illegally buying vapes for her teenage children in an attempt to control their nicotine addiction. She feels it is the only way to ensure the products are from a reputable source and to wean them onto lower-nicotine options. Her story highlights the challenges parents face with rising youth vaping, an issue the UK's recent disposable vape ban aims to address. Health experts and addiction clinics report that youth addiction is a growing problem, with some children experiencing withdrawal symptoms and long-term health concerns, prompting calls for more pediatric addiction services.</p>

Negotiations for a pause in fighting have been ongoing, with a recent proposal involving a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages and prisoners.

While she did not see what bit her, state parks officials and experts analyzed photos of the wounds and believe they were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark.

The government conceded on its plan to tighten criteria for disability payments, applying them only to new claimants after facing likely defeat in the Commons.
