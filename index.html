        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Democratic Party is currently facing an identity crisis, with no clear leader emerging to unite the party against the Trump administration. While figures like Sanders and Warren continue to voice opposition, younger politicians such as Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez represent different paths forward, contributing to internal divisions. However, this period of disunity may prove beneficial, allowing for grassroots rebuilding and a more localized approach to midterm elections. Experts suggest that focusing on organizational efforts and independent groups may be more effective than seeking a single savior. Optimism remains that a new generation of leaders will emerge from the chaos, offering a fresh vision for the party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates, have sent US stocks and the dollar into a slide. Trump's criticism comes as his own tariff policies have raised fears of an economic recession, exacerbating market uncertainty. The IMF has warned of "notable markdowns" in growth forecasts, potentially signaling a significant downturn in the US economy. Investors are seeking safe-haven assets like gold, which has hit record highs, indicating a lack of confidence in the US economy and its policies. (not investment advice)</p>

This move comes as Japan and the U.S. engage in further tariff talks, aiming for a swift resolution amid ongoing trade tensions.

Phillipson emphasized the need for appropriate services for all people, including transgender individuals, and noted that many businesses have moved towards unisex provisions.

          <p>A swimmer is missing following an extremely rare shark attack off the coast of northern Israel. The incident occurred near Hadera, where sharks are known to gather due to warm water discharged by a local power plant. Witnesses reported the attack, and police have closed the beach as a search is underway for the missing man. Fatal shark attacks are uncommon in Israeli waters, with no recorded incidents since 1948.</p>

          <p>German beer exports have decreased by 6% in the last decade, while domestic consumption has fallen by over 15%. This decline comes despite an increase in the number of breweries in Germany, although that number has also decreased since 2019. The drop in beer consumption may be linked to a growing awareness of the negative health consequences of drinking. Non-alcoholic beer sales are increasing in Germany as sales of alcoholic beverages decline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar briefly fell below 140 yen after President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. The yen was also bought on speculation that the U.S. administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness against the dollar. Tokyo stocks ended mixed as semiconductor-related issues tracked losses in their U.S. counterparts, while issues sensitive to domestic demand attracted buying. The benchmark price of gold set by Tokyo's Tanaka Precious Metal Technologies Co. hit an all-time high in yen terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been ordered to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after a U.S. District Court in Georgia granted temporary restraining orders on their behalf. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement "abruptly and unlawfully" terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), impacting students nearing graduation or enrolled in work programs. The lawsuit claims that ICE's actions are designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and "self-deporting."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists indicates a growing concern that the United States is rapidly transitioning from a liberal democracy towards authoritarianism. The scholars point to President Trump's attempts to expand executive power, attacks on the media and universities, and the filling of key government positions with loyalists as evidence of this trend. While some disagree, arguing that Trump is using legitimate presidential powers, many see parallels between his actions and those of leaders in countries like Hungary and Turkey. The scholars caution that the erosion of checks and balances could lead to a system of "competitive authoritarianism," where elections are no longer free and fair.</p>
