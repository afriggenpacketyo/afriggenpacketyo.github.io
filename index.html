          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murdering three relatives of her ex-husband by serving them poisonous mushrooms, testified in an Australian court about marital issues and strained relationships with her former in-laws. Patterson served a beef Wellington meal containing death cap mushrooms, resulting in the deaths of Don and Gail Patterson, and Heather Wilkinson, while Ian Wilkinson survived after a liver transplant. Patterson claimed the poisoning was accidental and revealed feelings of distance from her estranged husband's family, adding that she felt excluded from family events leading up to the fatal meal. She also mentioned personal struggles with low self-esteem and shifting spirituality, with the prosecution completing its evidence presentation.</p>

          <p>The second round of direct peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia occurred in Istanbul, Turkey, but yielded little progress beyond an agreement to exchange prisoners. Ukraine is seeking a full and unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days, a demand that Russia has rejected. Russia proposed a two-to-three day truce in certain areas, without providing specific details. Ukraine also provided a list of children it alleges have been forcibly taken to Russia, awaiting a response from Russia by the end of June and stressing the need for direct talks between presidents Zelensky and Putin. Optimism remains low as both sides hold firm on key demands, with Russia seeking recognition of annexed territories and guarantees against Ukraine joining military alliances.</p>

          <p>Britain's defence review outlines ambitious goals for transforming its armed forces to be ready for potential war, but achieving these goals will require more funding. The review welcomes the government's ambition to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2034 but suggests that it may be necessary to increase spending faster given the turbulent times. The review highlights Russia as an immediate threat, China as a sophisticated challenge, and Iran and North Korea as regional disruptors, with the unpredictability of these threats creating alarming new vulnerabilities for Britain. One of the report's authors describes the proposed changes as the most profound in UK defence in 150 years.</p>

He targeted the Run for Their Lives walk, which aims to raise awareness about hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and allegedly yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack. Soliman is being held on a $10,000,000 bond, and the Department of Homeland Security reports he is in the United States illegally.</p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles continues, with discussions focusing on gender-neutral fitness standards and the definition of lethality. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School, shares her experiences and perspectives on the issue. Vanasse argues that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, leadership, and the ability to build trust. She also addresses claims that standards were lowered for women in combat roles, asserting that she and other women met the same standards as their male counterparts.</p>

          <p>A Florida man is suing Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, alleging he sustained "permanent catastrophic injuries" while riding a water park slide in Walt Disney World Resort in 2021. Eugene Strickland is seeking $50,000 in damages, claiming he was dislodged from his inner tube on the Downhill Double Dipper at Disney's Blizzard Beach due to the ride's "exhilarating speeds." Strickland, who weighed 334 pounds at the time, alleges he landed forcefully on the slide's plastic surface, causing him to sustain serious bodily injury, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. Strickland claims Disney had a duty to warn him of dangerous conditions at the water slide.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna in Italy produced a spectacularly explosive eruption, sending a massive ash cloud into the sky and triggering a red alert for aviation crews. The volcanic cloud rose to an estimated height of about 21,325 feet and moved in a west-southwest direction. While the eruption forced officials to halt tourist visits to the volcano, it doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area. Aviation alerts were eased later as volcanic activity and ash emissions decreased.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a second court ruling that blocked the president's sweeping tariffs, arguing that the decisions "disrupt sensitive, ongoing negotiations with virtually every trading partner." A federal judge ruled that Trump does not have the power to unilaterally impose tariffs "to reorder the global economy." The administration argues that the ruling undercuts the president and threatens to disrupt negotiations by undermining the credibility of the tariffs as a threat. Lawyers with the Department of Justice also argue that the judge lacks the jurisdiction to issue the decision because legal disputes over trade policy belong in the Court of International Trade.</p>
