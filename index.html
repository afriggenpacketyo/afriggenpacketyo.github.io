        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. is not targeting specific currency rates in trade negotiations with Japan, aiming to find common ground after President Trump's tariff impositions. Bessent emphasized the U.S. expects Japan to honor the G7 agreement on currencies reflecting economic fundamentals and that the administration believes tariffs, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, and government subsidies should be addressed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. The meeting between Bessent and Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato follows Trump's accusations of Japan devaluing its currency to create a trade surplus, which the Japanese government denies.

          <p>The WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi vaccine alliance jointly warned about a global surge in vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, meningitis, and yellow fever, attributing the rise to funding cuts, misinformation, and humanitarian crises. Measles cases have risen by 20% in a year, reaching 10.3 million in 2023, with 138 countries reporting cases. The agencies are calling for increased funding to vaccinate vulnerable children and address the growing problem of missed routine vaccine doses, especially in fragile and conflict-affected countries.</p>

          <p>Campaigners are advocating for the creation of restricted zones where individuals convicted of murder, manslaughter, or stalking offenses would be required to live after being released from prison. Victims express feeling unsafe even with exclusion zones in place, arguing that the focus should shift to restricting perpetrators' movements rather than victims'. While the Ministry of Justice emphasizes that exclusion zones prevent offenders from approaching victims, some experts raise concerns that such restrictions could infringe on perpetrators' human rights, sparking debate about balancing victim safety and offender rights.</p>

          <p>Public criticism of Hamas is becoming more frequent in Gaza, with residents protesting against the group's governance and holding them responsible for the territory's crisis. These demonstrations, though dangerous due to Hamas' intolerance of dissent, reflect a growing sentiment that Hamas prioritizes its own rule over the well-being of Gazans. Recent incidents, including the abduction and death of a protester, highlight the risks involved in speaking out against Hamas, but some believe the group's authority is waning due to the ongoing conflict with Israel and the dire living conditions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor, analyzes various economic indicators to assess the probability of a US recession, noting that consumer and business confidence have declined due to trade tensions and tariffs. Prediction markets are pricing in a significantly elevated chance of recession, and while the Sahm rule does not yet signal a recession, other measures like purchasing managers' indices and GDP nowcasts suggest a potential downturn. Frankel estimates the odds of a US recession in the coming year as high as 60%, emphasizing the uncertainty but advising vigilance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, seeking to reassure Wall Street, indicated he would reduce his involvement with the federal government, acknowledging the limits of his influence on the Trump administration. This shift comes after a period where Musk played a significant role in Washington, driving changes across government agencies. While he intends to continue advocating for tariff reductions, he recognizes that President Trump's decisions ultimately rest with him.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's congressional delegation are urging President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. They argue that the catastrophic damage and loss of life warrant federal assistance to help the state rebuild. This marks the first time Republicans have publicly pushed back on a denial of FEMA relief requests during the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on charges of alleged bribery related to his ex-son-in-law's employment at a Thai budget airline. Prosecutors claim Moon received 217 million won (€134,000, $152,000) in connection with facilitating the employment. This development comes just weeks before a general election in South Korea, adding to the country's recent political controversies, including the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol.</p>
