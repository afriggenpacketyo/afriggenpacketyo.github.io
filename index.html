          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have adopted a more conciliatory tone regarding ongoing trade discussions, expressing hope for a future agreement. This development comes after a period of friction marked by U.S. tariffs on Indian goods due to its purchases of Russian oil. Both leaders indicated they would speak in the coming weeks to continue negotiations aimed at resolving trade barriers between the two nations. The positive statements represent a potential de-escalation in trade tensions, despite underlying disagreements on issues like agricultural access and India's energy partnerships remaining significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, the maker of the popular weight-loss drug Wegovy, has announced a major corporate restructuring that will result in approximately 9,000 job cuts worldwide. This represents about 11.5% of its total workforce and is intended to simplify the organization and reallocate resources toward growth areas in diabetes and obesity treatments. The move follows increased market competition, supply chain challenges, and disappointing trial results for a new drug candidate. The company adjusted its full-year operating profit growth forecast downward to account for one-off costs associated with the layoffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural and social history of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete tower blocks that defined much of the urban landscape in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of social decay and rising extremism following German reunification. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," uses art to delve into the collective memory associated with these structures, examining them as spaces of both community and painful transformation, and prompting a re-evaluation of their architectural heritage.</p>

          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich have announced plans to merge by autumn 2026, creating the United Kingdom's first regional "super-university" under the proposed name London and South East University Group.

While the universities will operate under a single vice-chancellor, they will retain their individual names, identities, and campuses. The merger aims to provide a stable financial foundation without immediate plans for job losses, though both institutions have recently made cuts.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old frontrunner for mayor of New York City, has faced scrutiny in the U.S. over his self-identification as both "Asian" and "Black or African American" on a past university application. However, in his birthplace of Kampala, Uganda, his identity is viewed as straightforwardly African. Ugandans of Indian descent, who have a long and complex history in the country, are widely considered part of the national fabric. This contrast highlights the differing conceptions of race and identity between the U.S. and Africa, where 'African' is seen as a continental identity rather than a racial one, easily encompassing Mamdani's multi-hyphenated heritage.</p>

          <p>Despite the public release of a birthday book for Jeffrey Epstein containing a crude message and sketch attributed to him, Donald Trump continues to deny he sent it. The message, from 2003, features a sketch of a woman's silhouette and a note ending with "may every day be another wonderful secret." Trump had previously filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for reporting on the message, but the newly released documents appear to vindicate the paper's reporting. The White House press secretary has reiterated the denial, calling the story part of a "Democrat Epstein Hoax," creating a significant political challenge for the administration.</p>

Ward notes that while Álvarez is the bigger name and more experienced at the 168lb weight, Crawford's technical skill and reach advantage make him a formidable opponent.

Statistical analysis, excluding penalties, shows that the team has taken the most shots in the league over the last 10 games while conceding among the fewest. The primary issue appears to be inefficiency in both scoring and goalkeeping, with the team underperforming its expected goals by a significant margin. This suggests that while the tactical setup is creating chances, player execution or confidence may be the root cause of the team's low point tally.</p>

The judge ruled that the administration's claims, which relate to conduct before Cook joined the Fed, were likely insufficient grounds for removal under the "for cause" provision of the Federal Reserve Act.

          <p>Ford has introduced a new global advertising campaign, "Ready, Set, Ford," marking a significant shift in its branding strategy during a period of major industry uncertainty. The campaign moves away from a vehicle-first approach to focus on the consumers who drive its cars, built on promises of capability, passion, community, and trust. Ford's Chief Marketing Officer stated the timing is intentional, aiming to leverage the brand's long history to help consumers navigate an uncertain economic and political climate. For the first time in decades, this new strategy will unify all of Ford's global brands under a single, consistent message.</p>

          <p>Ko Wen-je, the former chairman of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), has been released from detention after nearly a year on a record-breaking NT$70 million (US$2.3 million) bail. Ko, who was detained over corruption allegations tied to a land development project, immediately criticized the ruling authorities upon his release, accusing them of dividing the island. His freedom raises the possibility of a political comeback for the influential figure, who finished third in last year's presidential election. Supporters gathered to cheer his release, signaling potential new challenges for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</p>

          <p>For the first time, obesity has surpassed being underweight as the most common form of malnutrition among school-aged children and adolescents globally, according to a new UNICEF report. The data, collected from over 190 countries, shows that since 2000, the rate of underweight children aged five to 19 has decreased, while obesity rates have nearly tripled to 9.4%. UNICEF attributes this alarming trend to the proliferation of unhealthy food environments dominated by ultra-processed and fast foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. The report calls for urgent policy changes, including better food labeling and restrictions on junk food marketing.</p>

          <p>A new survey from the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reveals that a record 47% of U.S. businesses have redirected investments originally planned for China to other regions in the past year. Southeast Asia was the primary beneficiary of this shift, followed by the Indian subcontinent. The primary drivers of this trend are persistent U.S.-China trade tensions, the short-term nature of tariff truces, and increasing competition within the Chinese domestic market. This diversion reflects a broader decline in confidence, with pessimism about the five-year business outlook in China hitting a fourth consecutive record low among member companies.

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever vaccine designed to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia, a disease that has devastated their populations. Developed over a decade by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to reduce infection rates and decrease mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia can cause blindness, infertility, and death in koalas, and is a primary driver of their decline. Researchers are now seeking major funding to roll out the vaccine to wildlife hospitals and at-risk wild populations, calling it a critical tool alongside habitat restoration to save the species.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on India and China for their continued purchases of Russian oil. The proposal is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. According to sources, Trump made the request in a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials, indicating Washington would be prepared to mirror any tariffs Europe imposes. This move represents a significant potential escalation in global trade disputes, as the U.S. has already placed punitive tariffs on India, while China had previously secured a truce for lower levies.</p>

          <p>The public release of a 50th-birthday book for Jeffrey Epstein, created in 2003, offers a sickening look into how his predatory behavior was an open secret among his elite social circle. The book contains numerous lewd, crude, and sexually explicit tributes from powerful friends and business associates, seemingly celebrating his attraction to young women and girls. This article argues that the document serves as a validation for long-held suspicions that Epstein's crimes were enabled by powerful people who either participated or dismissed them as a quirk. The contents, including a now-infamous note from Donald Trump, provide textual and visual confirmation of the rot within at least one group of elites.</p>

Qatar condemned the strike as a "cowardly" violation of international law, while the White House called the incident "unfortunate" but described the elimination of Hamas as a "worthy goal," creating a tense diplomatic situation with its key regional ally.</p>

Meta has strongly denied the allegations, calling them "nonsense" and based on selectively leaked documents.

Clashes between demonstrators and police have turned violent, resulting in at least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries.
