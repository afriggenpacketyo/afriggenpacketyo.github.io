          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 800 D.C. National Guard members and taken temporary control of the city's Metropolitan Police Department to address what it calls a crime emergency. This action is permitted by the D.C. Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control for federal purposes in special emergencies. While Guard members are authorized to make arrests, their current mission is stated to be in support of federal law enforcement, not direct policing. D.C. officials have expressed unease with the move, leading to conflicting views on the chain of command.</p>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid to purchase Google's Chrome browser, a move that follows a U.S. Department of Justice proposal for Google to divest Chrome after an antitrust ruling. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, recently launched its own browser and is positioning itself aggressively in the competitive AI landscape. The bid, backed by several investors, is seen as a strategic attempt to gain a major foothold in the browser market, which is a critical gateway for internet search and data collection. Google has not yet responded to the offer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study highlights significant but uneven progress in cancer survival over the past five decades, with the gap widening between the most and least survivable cancers. While survival rates for cancers like melanoma and breast cancer have dramatically improved due to better treatments and earlier detection, those for pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancer have seen minimal advancement. Researchers and charities attribute the disparity to difficulties in detecting these deadlier cancers and a lack of effective treatment options. They are calling for increased investment in research and a focus on early detection to close this survival gap.</p>

          <p>A recent Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race, with incumbent Eric Adams trailing significantly. Mamdani's support is strongest among younger voters, while Cuomo performs better with Black and Jewish voters. The poll also shows Republican Elise Stefanik narrowing the gap against Governor Kathy Hochul in a hypothetical 2026 gubernatorial contest. The results suggest a potential shift in New York politics, though leading Democrats have not yet fully endorsed Mamdani.</p>

The review, which targets major institutions like the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, will scrutinize public-facing text, curatorial processes, and future plans. This move has raised concerns about political interference in the nation's cultural and historical institutions, following recent controversies over exhibit content related to the president.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Expand Police Use of Live Facial Recognition Technology</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office announced the rollout of ten new vans equipped with live facial recognition (LFR) technology to seven police forces across England. The government states the technology is a crucial tool for locating suspects in serious crimes like sexual offenses and homicides, citing its success in London. However, civil liberties groups such as Big Brother Watch and Liberty have raised alarms about the expansion of this surveillance technology without a robust legislative framework. They argue it is an intrusive measure being implemented before public consultation and a pending judicial review are complete.</p>

          <p>Starting in early 2026, the UK's driving theory test for cars and motorcycles will include questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of defibrillators. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) hopes this initiative will equip millions of new drivers with life-saving knowledge, as they are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency. The updated learning materials aim to improve public understanding of first aid, which could significantly increase survival rates for cardiac arrest victims.</p>

          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are experiencing a 30% reduction in their harvest this year due to climate change. Warmer winter temperatures have disrupted the essential "sleep" cycle of stone fruit trees, which require a certain number of hours below 45 degrees to regulate their nutrients and produce a full crop. This phenomenon is impacting not only farmers' livelihoods but also consumers, who are seeing higher prices for peaches. Some farmers, like the Masumoto family, have found that older groves and traditional irrigation methods have helped their trees better tolerate these temperature swings.</p>

          <p>A new report from the U.S. State Department has accused the United Kingdom of having "significant human rights issues," specifically citing restrictions on free speech and a rise in antisemitic violence. The annual report, which states that human rights in the UK "worsened" in 2024, highlights concerns over public space protection orders, "safe access zones" around abortion clinics, and the Online Safety Act. The criticism echoes previous concerns raised by Vice President JD Vance and others, though the UK government maintains it upholds freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors have filed two new corruption charges against City Councilman Curren Price, adding to an existing case involving allegations of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest. The original charges alleged that Price's wife received payments from developers for whom Price later voted to approve projects. The new charges claim Price also had a conflict of interest when he voted on grants that benefited city agencies which were paying his wife's consulting firm hundreds of thousands of dollars. Price's attorney has dismissed the new charges as an attempt to bolster a "weak case."</p>

          <p>Hundreds of workers and advocates gathered in MacArthur Park to protest the Trump administration's immigration raids in Los Angeles. The protest, organized by labor groups like SEIU, called for an end to the federal enforcement actions, which have created a climate of fear among the city's large immigrant communities. Speakers urged a boycott of major companies they claim are not adequately protecting their immigrant employees. The park has become a symbolic site for the protests after federal agents conducted a large-scale operation there in July, escalating tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming meeting between President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, is a high-stakes diplomatic effort to address the war in Ukraine. Trump initiated the summit after his deadline for a Russian ceasefire passed, aiming to personally broker an end to the conflict, though the White House has framed it as a "listening exercise." The location in Alaska, once Russian territory, adds historical resonance. Ukraine will not be present, raising concerns from President Zelenskyy that any deal made "without us, will not work" and could involve unacceptable land concessions.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell 9% in extended trading, even after the company reported quarterly revenue and future guidance that surpassed analyst expectations. The company's revenue more than tripled year-over-year, driven by intense demand for its Nvidia chip rental services. Despite the strong performance and an optimistic forecast, the company reported a net loss of $290.5 million and its stock-based compensation costs impacted operating margins. The share drop occurred despite the positive operational news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers are closely studying the electronic warfare (EW) tactics employed in the Ukraine conflict, viewing it as a critical learning opportunity. A paper by Chinese scientists detailed an early phase of the war where Russia jammed all satellite navigation systems, including the U.S. GPS and China's own Beidou system, prompting a counter-jamming response from Western powers. This event, described as a major EW engagement between great powers, provides valuable real-world data for China's military to analyze and draw lessons from for its own strategic development.</p>
