          <p>A 54-year-old man is under arrest on suspicion of murder after a house fire claimed the lives of a man, a woman, and a four-year-old girl in Rushton, Northamptonshire.  The intense fire is hampering the investigation into the cause, and the community is deeply affected by the tragedy. The BBC's reporting appears neutral, though the focus on the emotional impact on villagers might subtly downplay potential investigative angles.</p>
