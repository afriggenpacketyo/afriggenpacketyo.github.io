          <p>Democratic lawmakers allege the Trump administration is improperly seizing tax refunds from defaulted student loan borrowers without providing the legally required 60-day notice. A letter to the Education Secretary highlights that these actions have led to severe financial hardship for families, including evictions. Critics argue that notices issued years ago, before the pandemic-era pause on collections, are insufficient given significant life changes borrowers may have experienced. The issue is particularly concerning as the administration has reduced staff at the Federal Student Aid office, potentially exacerbating communication and data accuracy problems for millions of at-risk borrowers.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines announced it is making substantial progress in its restructuring efforts during a recent bankruptcy court hearing. The carrier has secured agreements for up to $475 million in new financing and an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor, pending court approval. To cut costs amid significant financial losses, Spirit plans to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft, many of which are grounded due to engine defects. The airline is also reducing its operational footprint by cutting 40 routes, furloughing flight attendants, and renegotiating labor agreements to achieve its revitalization goals.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting and fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, has left four people dead and several others injured. The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old military veteran, drove his vehicle into the church before opening fire and is also deceased. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, with authorities noting the suspect's hatred for people of the Mormon faith. Officials praised the heroic actions of churchgoers and first responders during the attack, which occurred a day after the faith's president passed away.</p>

Additionally, strong quarterly results from competitor Jefferies, driven by record advisory fees, provide a positive indicator for Goldman's upcoming earnings report.

          <p>The fate of enhanced premium tax credits for 22 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act is a key sticking point in federal government shutdown negotiations. These subsidies, which have nearly doubled enrollment in ACA marketplace plans since 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democratic lawmakers are making their extension a condition for passing a funding bill, while Republicans resist. If the credits expire, average insurance premiums could more than double in 2026, potentially forcing millions to drop their coverage and adding significant financial strain on households already concerned about the cost of living.</p>

Instead of focusing on the shooter's motives, the article contemplates how Nelson would have responded, suggesting he would have emphasized Christ's teaching to love one's enemies.

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House, as Argentina seeks a $20 billion credit swap line from the U.S. The potential deal has caused some friction within Republican circles after Argentina temporarily removed its grain export tariffs and sold billions of dollars in soybeans to China. This move is seen as directly undercutting U.S. farmers during their prime marketing season. The meeting aims to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two nations as Milei continues his aggressive austerity measures to address Argentina's long-standing economic issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column explores why nearly half of Americans now identify as politically independent, arguing that the term has become an "empty signifier" for those rejecting partisan labels. The author posits that both the Republican and Democratic parties have undergone "institutional isomorphism," where their associated media, activist groups, and institutions have converged into rigid, undifferentiated ideological blocs. This conformity, driven by the primary system, leaves general election voters feeling alienated and stuck choosing between two unappealing, narrowly defined candidates. As a result, identifying as an independent has become a statement of dissatisfaction with the current political duopoly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current threat of a U.S. government shutdown is considered more serious than previous instances due to a White House directive for agencies to prepare for permanent layoffs. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget instructed departments to ready reduction-in-force notices for programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This potential for permanent job losses marks a sharp escalation from past shutdowns, which typically involved temporary furloughs with guaranteed back pay. The standoff is caused by a congressional impasse over a short-term funding bill, with Democrats demanding extensions for healthcare subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid cuts.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For an $80,000 HELOC, the current average monthly payment is approximately $966 for a 10-year repayment period and $759 for a 15-year period, both significantly lower than costs from a year ago. The article notes that HELOCs, with their variable rates, are currently cheaper than home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards. Borrowers are advised to consider various rate scenarios to ensure long-term affordability before leveraging their home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An internal email from the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has reportedly directed employees to avoid using terms such as "climate change," "emissions," and "decarbonization." The guidance is part of a broader trend within the administration to control language around environmental issues, which critics argue silences key aspects of the agency's mission. While the DOE's press secretary denied any formal directive, the move aligns with the administration's public skepticism of climate science and recent cancellations of funding for renewable energy projects, sparking concern among environmental advocates.</p>

Democrats, in turn, criticize the Republican bill as partisan for excluding negotiations on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and restoring Medicaid cuts.

The address was seen as a direct response to critics within his own Labour party who have questioned his ability to effectively counter Farage's populist appeal. Starmer sought to remind his party of their significant general election victory 15 months prior and framed the current political landscape as a clear choice between Reform and all other parties.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the widely misunderstood "7-year rule" for credit card debt, which primarily governs how long negative information can remain on a consumer's credit report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most negative marks like late payments and charge-offs must be removed after seven years from the first delinquency. While this removal can improve a credit score, the debt itself does not disappear. Additionally, state statutes of limitations, often around seven years, can prevent creditors from suing for old debt, but this legal defense must be actively raised in court.</p>

The remarks were made at a rare summit at Marine Corps Base Quantico, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also announced a cultural overhaul at the Pentagon.
