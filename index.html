          <p>President Trump's meme coin contest, offering tickets to an exclusive crypto dinner gala, concluded with potential winners including foreign investors. The leaderboard of top holders revealed wallets linked to foreign individuals and entities, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. While the coin's price has fluctuated, some investors profited immensely while many others lost money. The coin's website initially advertised a White House tour, but later changed it to a 'Special VIP tour' arranged by a third party. The White House maintains that President Trump is abiding by all conflict of interest laws. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who was jailed in 1987 for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal after 38 years of imprisonment due to new DNA evidence. The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case back to the court after fresh testing revealed a DNA profile pointing to an unknown attacker in semen samples from the crime scene. The Crown Prosecution Service agreed that the DNA evidence undermined Sullivan's conviction, and he was released, marking what is believed to be the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history. Sindall was sexually assaulted in Birkenhead, Merseyside.</p>

          <p>Data indicates that the U.S.-China trade war has pushed the global supply chain near its breaking point, with President Trump's tariffs significantly impacting North American and Asian manufacturing. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index shows a steep decline in April purchasing activity after a rush to stockpile supplies. While the tariff pause provides some relief, manufacturers remain anxious about long-term risks associated with China. The data suggests that the supply chain volatility should serve as a warning about the potential consequences if the tariff pause is not extended permanently.</p>

The company also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen, with U.S. tariffs adding further pressure.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing stricter work requirements for food stamps to cut government waste and save taxpayer money for President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill.' The proposal would raise the upper age limit for work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) from 54 to 64 and include SNAP recipients with children above age 7. The House Agriculture Committee aims to find $230 billion in spending cuts, restoring the program's original intent and cracking down on loopholes. The legislation also seeks to have states cover some SNAP costs and lower the government's reimbursement rate for administrative costs.</p>

          <p>Democrats, who have traditionally focused on immigration to court Latino voters, are now pivoting to emphasize the economy. The shift comes after Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election and a rightward trend among Latino voters. Strategists argue that a broad economic message may be more effective than micro-targeting specific nationalities. Inflation and affordability are key concerns for Latino voters, and Democrats aim to address these issues in the upcoming elections.</p>

This has led to increased scrutiny and stricter enforcement of lottery regulations, including a ban on lottery courier services.
