          <p>The US government has reiterated its intention to impose a baseline 30% tariff on the European Union starting August 1, despite ongoing negotiations. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed confidence that a deal would eventually be reached but emphasized the deadline is non-negotiable, meaning tariffs will take effect regardless of talks continuing. The EU is preparing retaliatory measures but hopes to secure a more favorable deal similar to the 10% baseline tariff agreement reached with the UK. Economists are skeptical of the EU's chances due to the contentious trade relationship with the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that individuals retiring in 2050 could be financially worse off than current pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly increased. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is relaunching the Pensions Commission to investigate why nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners, the self-employed, women, and some ethnic minorities, are not saving adequately. The commission aims to build a national consensus on a new strategy to close the savings gap, which currently sees future retirees facing an average annual shortfall of £800.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Democrats Must Address Economic Concerns to Regain Young and Black Voters' Trust by 2028</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Fox News opinion article contends that the Democratic party is losing support among crucial demographics, like young and Black voters, by focusing on identity politics over pressing economic issues. The author criticizes establishment figures like Rahm Emanuel for critiquing the party's direction after having shaped its current state, arguing this alienates voters who are struggling with affordability, housing, and debt. The piece suggests that the 2028 election presents a unique opportunity for Democrats to reconnect with their base by championing candidates who offer authentic solutions to economic hardships rather than relying on anointed insiders.</p>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly demanding better compensation, highlighting the issue with "Pay us what you owe us" warm-up shirts at the All-Star Game amid stalled collective bargaining negotiations. While the league has reported annual losses, other financial indicators like rising attendance, soaring broadcast rights values, and increased team valuations suggest significant growth. Players argue their share of revenue is under 10%, a very low figure for a professional sports league, and point to the disparity between the WNBA's minimum salary and that of the NBA. They are advocating for higher pay and larger roster sizes to increase job security.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, arguing the move is an illegal attempt to control its academic decisions. The administration froze the funds, which support vital research in medicine and science, citing Harvard's alleged failure to address antisemitism on campus. In court, Harvard's lawyers argue the government violated proper procedure, infringed upon First Amendment rights, and that there is no rational link between the antisemitism claims and the suspended research. The case is being closely watched by other universities facing similar funding freezes.</p>

The bills would also mandate greater transparency in ingredient disclosure, addressing gaps in the 2022 Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act.

Business owners argue the tariffs are essentially a tax on Americans, as the U.S. does not produce coffee at a scale to meet domestic demand, and the increased costs will be passed down the supply chain.

The high court panel concluded that the prosecution had "utterly failed" to prove its case and found the evidence unreliable, leading to the quashing of all convictions.

This strategy, originating from economist Vilfredo Pareto's observations, acknowledges that a small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all other losses or smaller successes. VCs therefore seek startups with "outsized-outcome potential," looking for visionary founders and ideas that can define a new category. Founders are advised to pitch a bold, compelling story about their company's potential to achieve massive scale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jake Larson, a World War II veteran who became a beloved TikTok personality known as "Papa Jake," has passed away at the age of 102. Larson captivated over a million followers by sharing his firsthand accounts of the war, including his experience as a D-Day survivor who landed on Omaha Beach. He enlisted in the National Guard at 15 by lying about his age and later helped plan the Normandy invasion. In his later years, he combined humor with somber reminders of war's horrors, earning an Emmy and becoming an online "legend" who felt he was the "luckiest man in the world."</p>

          <h2>UK Could Benefit from US-EU Trade Tensions as Post-Brexit Position Offers Tariff Advantages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom may inadvertently benefit if the U.S. imposes its threatened 30% trade tariffs on the European Union. Having already secured a more favorable trade deal with the U.S. that includes lower tariffs, the UK could become an attractive manufacturing hub for EU companies looking to avoid the steep American levies. This situation presents a potential opportunity for Britain to regain some of the manufacturing capacity it lost after Brexit. However, some analysts are skeptical, noting that shifting production facilities is a long-term process and that the UK's primary strength lies in services. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Assets under management in Chinese bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surged to over $50 billion, driven by investor demand for low-risk assets amid deflationary pressures and an uncertain economic outlook. These ETFs offer lower costs, diversification, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, which have expanded sixfold since last year, as investors seek higher yields than those available from government debt. This trend reflects a broader shift towards safer, fixed-income products as China's economy navigates trade frictions and weak domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from about 30 top companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage fresh domestic investment and combat two years of recession. The meeting is part of the "Made for Germany" initiative, which aims to restore confidence in the nation's struggling economy. While the government has approved billions in tax relief and a major infrastructure fund, it emphasizes that private sector capital is essential for recovery. Germany, once Europe's economic engine, has been hit hard by inflation, high energy costs, and global competition, prompting this major push. (not investment advice)</p>

Similarly, in Algeria, new and upgraded railways will connect the Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports over 1,650km away.

The sanctions were imposed just days before a high-stakes EU-China leaders' summit in Beijing. China's Ministry of Commerce expressed "resolute opposition" to the move, which sources indicate Beijing had lobbied intensively to prevent. The action escalates tensions between the two economic powers as they prepare for critical talks on trade and geopolitical issues.</p>

The fighting, which killed hundreds and displaced over 100,000 people, threatened to destabilize Syria's fragile post-war transition and drew in Israeli airstrikes against government forces who had sided with the Bedouins. Humanitarian aid convoys are now entering the city, though tensions remain high.

          <p>Two blocks of flats in Kirkby, Merseyside, are set to be closed due to severe fire safety issues, leaving residents homeless and revealing what one MP calls a "broken leasehold system." Over the years, flat owners at Beech Rise and Willow Rise have spent significant sums on repairs and fees, while the buildings' value and condition deteriorated under a series of management companies. An estimated £1 million of tenants' and taxpayers' money has been spent trying to fix the problems, including nearly £400,000 from the local council for safety patrols. The case underscores the vulnerability of leaseholders responsible for costs but lacking control.</p>

Unable to pay the multi-million-pound ransom demand, the company was forced to cease operations.
