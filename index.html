        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has approved evacuation plans for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, a crucial step toward potentially restarting the world's largest nuclear facility. The plant, operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company, has been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The approval from the central government's nuclear disaster prevention council marks significant progress for Japan's nuclear energy policy under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. However, the final hurdle for the restart remains, as the operator must still secure the consent of local residents in Niigata Prefecture, where the complex is located.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced that its global sales for May increased by 6.9 percent compared to the previous year, reaching a record high of 898,721 units for the month. The company attributed the strong performance to a surge in last-minute demand from consumers in the United States. This demand was reportedly driven by concerns that vehicle prices could soon rise due to the potential imposition of high tariffs by the U.S. government. In contrast to the sales growth, Toyota's global production experienced a slight decline of 0.7 percent for the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil reaches its 50th anniversary, prompting reflection on its controversial history and future. Signed in 1975, the deal aimed to build eight nuclear plants in Brazil but has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with only one plant becoming fully operational. Despite Germany's nuclear phase-out, the treaty remains active, and critics point to its outdated safety standards and geopolitical entanglements, including uranium deals involving Russia. The agreement's future is uncertain, as some German politicians advocate for its termination in favor of renewable energy partnerships.</p>

          <p>Japan has executed Takahiro Shiraishi, known as the "Twitter killer," for the 2017 murders of nine people. Shiraishi contacted his victims, who had expressed suicidal thoughts on social media, before strangling, sexually assaulting, and dismembering them in his apartment. This marks the country's first use of capital punishment since July 2022 and occurs amid ongoing debates about the death penalty. The practice is still supported by a majority of the Japanese public but is heavily criticized by international human rights groups and other industrialized democracies.</p>

The presiding judge acknowledged the dangerous and shocking nature of the attacks but attributed her actions significantly to a mental disorder, including obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The appointment and subsequent dismissal of chief of staff Sue Gray highlighted operational turmoil within Downing Street.

          <p>NATO is strengthening its engagement with the commercial space industry as part of a broader strategy to enhance its defense capabilities. Alliance members have pledged to more than double defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, with a portion dedicated to security-linked infrastructure like space and cyber warfare. Recognizing space as an operational domain, NATO's new commercial strategy aims to leverage private sector innovation for communication, navigation, and surveillance.

          <p>A new report from the Royal United Services Institute reveals that organized criminal gangs are fueling a significant rise in car thefts across the United Kingdom. Vehicle thefts have increased by 75% over the past decade, with cars being stolen and shipped out of the country in as little as 24 hours. The criminals use sophisticated technology to steal not just high-end vehicles but also common models like the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Golf, supplying them to overseas markets where parts or whole vehicles are in high demand. This surge in crime costs the UK economy an estimated Â£1.77 billion annually and has contributed to a sharp rise in car insurance premiums.</p>

          <p>A United Nations agency is advocating for global collaboration on artificial intelligence ethics at a forum in Bangkok, as the technology's rapid advancement continues to reshape society. Unesco Director-General Audrey Azoulay opened the event by calling for a unified approach among governments, businesses, and civil society to ensure AI serves the common good. The forum, attended by over 1,000 participants and 35 government ministers, aims to build support for Unesco's ethics guidelines. However, the absence of major AI companies from the US and China underscores the challenge of achieving consensus amid deepening geopolitical and technological rivalries.</p>

          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law that curtails public benefits for undocumented immigrants, potentially cutting off access to life-saving HIV medication. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a doctor and four anonymous patients, argues the law is vague and contradicts federal statutes. It specifically targets the denial of benefits from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which provides crucial treatment to low-income patients. According to the complaint, withdrawing this treatment would have devastating health consequences for patients and increase the public health risk of HIV transmission in the community.</p>

While Lamb states he is not currently running for office, his increased visibility and criticism of Fetterman are fueling speculation about a potential primary challenge in 2028.

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, prominent economists argued that China must undergo significant structural reforms to transition into a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu of HKUST noted that China's current model, which heavily subsidizes production, creates trade imbalances and global friction. To achieve sustainable wealth and harmonize global trade relationships, she asserted that China needs to increase its internal consumption. The panel suggested that opportunities for growth exist in the services sector and that local governments should be incentivized to measure success based on consumption metrics, not just production output.</p>

          <p>The Santa Ynez Reservoir in Pacific Palisades, which was controversially empty and undergoing repairs during the destructive January firestorm, is now back in operation. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced the completion of extensive repairs to the reservoir's torn floating cover, a process that took longer than expected due to additional damage. Residents and officials had questioned why the critical piece of water infrastructure was offline when it was most needed, as firefighters encountered dry hydrants while battling the blaze. The DWP has not addressed ongoing inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the reservoir's status during the fire.</p>

          <p>A host of high-profile celebrities has arrived in Venice, Italy, for the wedding celebrations of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren SÃ¡nchez. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Tom Brady were seen attending a pre-wedding event ahead of the main ceremony. The gathering of approximately 200 guests has drawn some local protest, with a "No Space for Bezos" campaign emerging amid broader European concerns about over-tourism and rising costs. This will be the second marriage for both Bezos and SÃ¡nchez, who began their relationship after divorcing their previous spouses in 2019.</p>

          <h2>Xiaomi Shares Hit Record High After New EV Undercuts Tesla's Pricing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 22:29:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi surged to a record high following a strong customer response to its new electric vehicle, the YU7 SUV. The company priced the new model to be cheaper than Tesla's competing Model Y in China, a strategy that resulted in over 200,000 orders within three minutes of its launch. CEO Lei Jun claimed the YU7 surpasses the Model Y on several metrics, though it falls short on driver-assist features. This aggressive pricing continues Xiaomi's strategy from its first EV and intensifies the ongoing price war in the competitive Chinese electric car market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Honduran asylum seeker has filed a lawsuit against U.S. immigration authorities for her immediate release after she and her two children were arrested outside a Los Angeles immigration court. Her 6-year-old son is battling leukemia and requires regular medical monitoring, which was interrupted by their detention. The family, who had been paroled into the country to pursue their asylum case, was unexpectedly arrested after a judge dismissed their case at the government's request. The lawsuit argues their detention is unlawful and violates their due process rights, as they are now facing expedited removal to Honduras.</p>
