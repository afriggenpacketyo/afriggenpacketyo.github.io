          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment icon, has announced his decision to retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway after six decades, citing the irreversible effects of aging. Buffett noted experiencing balance issues, memory lapses, and declining vision. He will remain chairman, while Greg Abel will assume the role of CEO on January 1, 2026. Buffett emphasized his continued mental sharpness for investment decisions, particularly during market downturns, and said he will be useful if there's a panic in the market because he doesn't get fearful when things go down in price or everybody else gets scared.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Georgetown scholar Dr. Badar Khan Suri, who was detained allegedly based on his pro-Palestinian speech. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri was unjustly punished for his protected First Amendment speech and his wife's past work with the Gaza foreign ministry. The judge concluded Suri is not a flight risk or danger and should be released on bail. The judge admonished the government for failing to provide evidence that Suri was not being retaliated against for his First Amendment-protected speech.</p>

          <p>NBC canceled 'Lopez vs. Lopez' after three seasons, underscoring the challenges faced by broadcast television in competing with streaming services. The show, which explored themes of generational trauma and machismo in the Latino community, was one of the few network shows with significant Latino representation. The cancellation does not come as a surprise to media experts, who note the difficulties broadcast television faces due to the rise of streaming and recent industry disruptions. The cancellation of multiple Latino-led projects across platforms highlights a lack of representation.</p>

          <p>Following a series of radar outages at some of the country's busiest airports, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the antiquated telecommunications, radio and surveillance systems. The word 'radar' is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging, coined by the U.S. Navy in the 1940s. The technology dates back to the late 19th century, with German physicist Christian HÃ¼lsmeyer creating the Telemobiloskop in 1904. The British military significantly advanced radar technology during World War II.</p>
