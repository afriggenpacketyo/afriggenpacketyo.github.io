          <p>Following a two-hour phone call between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Russia launched over 100 drones into Ukraine, according to Ukraine's air force. Ukraine claims to have shot down 35 drones and neutralized 58, reporting damage in four regions. Trump asserted that peace talks would "immediately" resume, while Putin emphasized "eliminating the root causes of this crisis". Zelenskyy stated Ukraine's readiness for a ceasefire, urging stronger sanctions if Russia resists.

Ebid, who arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 and applied for asylum, managed a Â£12 million operation, bribing officials and threatening migrants. The judge condemned Ebid for ruthlessly exploiting desperate individuals for profit, emphasizing the horrifying treatment of migrants and the considerable risk of loss of life.

          <p>The European Union formally adopted its 17th package of sanctions on Russia as EU defense and foreign ministers met in Brussels.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the need for "consequences" from Washington if Moscow does not agree to an unconditional ceasefire.

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the worldâ€™s largest electric car battery maker, restricted U.S. onshore investors from participating in its Hong Kong stock listing due to escalating tensions between China and the United States. This move marks a reversal from a decade ago when Chinese companies actively sought U.S. investment. CATL, a key technology company supplying batteries to major automakers like GM and Tesla, has been caught in the crossfire of sanctions and blacklists. While most large American institutions can still trade CATL shares through offshore accounts, the exclusion signals a growing financial decoupling between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to cover tariff costs. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales originate in the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China. Despite beating sales estimates, Home Depot missed first-quarter earnings expectations, reflecting a challenging backdrop of muted sales growth due to higher mortgage rates and borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI-generated art raises concerns beyond the lack of originality, as it disrupts the connection between artist, artwork, and audience, which is essential for a democratic society. Art is defined by imbuing an object with the artist's ineffable being, allowing viewers to connect with the artist and each other on a deep, emotional level. AI-generated content, being uninhabited by genuine human experience, offers only spectral mimicry, potentially deceiving fragile souls and leading to a loss of community and democratic values. The article argues that AI art risks turning people into passive consumers, controlled by billionaires, and calls for a rejection of machine-generated art in favor of authentic human expression.</p>

Trump aims to persuade these factions to support the bill, facing resistance from hard-line fiscal hawks demanding deficit reduction and concerns over Medicaid work requirements.

This statement follows Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi's warning that talks would fail if the U.S. insists on Iran abandoning uranium enrichment. The U.S. views enrichment as a step toward nuclear weapons, while Iran asserts its program is for peaceful purposes. Since April 12, Iran and the U.S. have held four rounds of Omani-mediated nuclear talks.</p>

          <h2>Investors Wary as Spending Bill Threatens to Swell Federal Deficit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global investors are increasingly concerned about America's swelling federal deficit as Republicans negotiate a spending bill that could add trillions to the debt. This concern, coupled with President Trump's ongoing trade war, has introduced volatility into the markets. Foreign investors appear to be selling off U.S. assets, including Treasury bonds, a trend that began with the tariff disputes. Moody's recent downgrade of America's credit rating further underscores these fiscal anxieties, leading analysts to anticipate potential drops in Wall Street earnings estimates and higher borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with Juan Soto about his effort level after the outfielder failed to run hard on a ball that bounced off the Green Monster for a single. This marks the second instance in two days where Soto's lack of hustle has been questioned, drawing criticism from fans. While Soto denies any lack of effort, Mendoza emphasized the importance of running hard out of the batter's box, particularly in Fenway Park. The Mets, despite Soto's mixed start since signing a record contract, are tied for the second-best record in MLB.</p>

          <p>Shipments of Chinese-made smartphones, including Apple's iPhone, to the United States plummeted to their lowest levels since 2011 in April, highlighting the impact of U.S. tariffs.

This decline underscores the disruption of tech supply chains and the diversion of electronics production elsewhere.
