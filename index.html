          <h2>Casey Report Highlights Ethnicity Data Gaps in Grooming Gang Cases, Calls for Action</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 16:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that authorities have avoided addressing the ethnicity of perpetrators in grooming gangs, with ethnicity data unrecorded for two-thirds of offenders. The report emphasizes that this lack of data hinders accurate assessment and perpetuates ignorance, allowing abuse to continue unchecked. Casey's audit criticizes the failure of organizations to understand the nature and scale of the problem, attributing it to a fear of appearing racist or causing community tensions. The government has pledged to implement the report's recommendations, including mandatory data collection on ethnicity and a national inquiry into grooming gangs to address this critical issue, ensuring that children are seen as victims and not collaborators in their abuse. Optimism remains low given the historical lack of action on this issue.</p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has exacerbated existing divisions within both the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States. Democrats are split over Israel's military strategy, with some supporting Israel's right to defend itself and others warning against escalating regional violence. Republicans are divided between traditional hawks who support Israel and the "America First" movement, which advocates for limited U.S. military involvement overseas. President Trump's stance on the conflict, advocating for negotiations while also warning Iran against attacks, reflects the complex and evolving dynamics within the Republican Party regarding foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 67% of newlyweds incur debt to finance their weddings, highlighting the financial pressures associated with these celebrations. While some consider wedding debt frivolous, experts argue that it can be "good debt" if it provides a return on investment, even if non-financial. Experts recommend using credit cards with 0% introductory offers or personal lines of credit to manage wedding expenses wisely. Regardless of the debt type, creating a repayment plan is crucial to avoid financial strain and ensure a strong financial foundation for the marriage.</p>

It exempts the National Guard, troops, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters.

          <h2>Climate Change Triples Frequency of Extreme Weather-Linked Atmospheric Waves, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 15:02:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that climate change has tripled the frequency of atmospheric wave events linked to extreme summer weather since the 1950s, potentially explaining why long-range forecasts underestimate severe weather events. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, connects these planetary waves to events like the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave and the 2010 Russian heatwave. The increased frequency is attributed to the Arctic warming faster than the rest of the world, weakening jet streams and making the waves more likely to get locked in place. The study suggests that computer models are not fully capturing this mechanism, leading to underestimations of extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Israel struck Iranian state television and warned residents of Tehran to evacuate, escalating the conflict between the two nations. The strike followed another wave of Iranian missiles targeting Israel, resulting in civilian casualties. Israel accused Iran of deliberately targeting civilians and claimed to have destroyed a significant portion of Iran's surface-to-surface missile launchers. The fighting has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks and heightened tensions in the region.</p>
