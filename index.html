            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight, citing humanitarian grounds. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded cautiously, stating Ukraine would reciprocate with a full ceasefire if Russia demonstrated genuine commitment. This announcement followed Secretary of State Marco Rubio's expression of frustration with the lack of progress in peace talks, suggesting the U.S. might shift focus. The ceasefire announcement also coincided with a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, mediated by the United Arab Emirates. Optimism Score: 35</p>

            <p>Free breakfast clubs are set to launch at 750 schools across England, offering half an hour of free morning childcare to thousands of parents as part of a trial. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson touted the move as a way to break down barriers to opportunity, potentially saving parents £450 per year in childcare costs. However, teaching unions have voiced concerns that government funding for the scheme will not meet the actual costs, potentially impacting school budgets. Headteachers worry about subsidizing the shortfall and are seeking assurance that funding will be carefully reviewed during the trial. Optimism Score: 70</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully tested a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb that triggers devastating chemical chain reactions without using nuclear materials. The 2kg device generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, significantly longer than TNT blasts. Developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the bomb uses a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material, originally designed for clean energy applications. The hydrogen gas, released through rapid thermal decomposition, ignites into a sustained inferno, showcasing the potential for new types of explosive devices. Optimism Score: 50</p>
