          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of a Venezuelan Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holder wrongfully detained and nearly deported.  The judge cited the holder's valid TPS status, contradicting government claims based on social media and tattoos. The ruling highlights concerns about due process and the potential for wrongful deportations under the Trump administration's policies. The judge also ordered the government to cover the released individual's travel expenses back to New York.</p>

          <p>Eighteen states have filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order on voting, arguing it unconstitutionally infringes on states' rights and could disenfranchise millions.  The lawsuit targets provisions such as requiring proof of citizenship for federal voter registration and preventing the counting of mailed ballots arriving after Election Day.  This is one of several legal challenges against the executive order, raising serious concerns about its constitutionality and potential impact on voting access. The states argue the order is an overreach of presidential power.</p>

The article acknowledges the current unpredictability of Trump's tariff approach as a potential drawback, suggesting a more measured approach could be more effective.
