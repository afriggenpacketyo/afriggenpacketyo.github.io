          <p>Oracle's stock surged 40% after the company reported an astounding $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and setting a historic gain since 1992. This performance positions Oracle to approach a $1 trillion market cap, driven by robust demand for its cloud infrastructure business and crucial access to Nvidia's graphics processing units amidst the artificial intelligence boom. Despite missing first-quarter revenue and earnings, the massive cloud backlog firmly establishes Oracle as a pivotal AI enabler in the rapidly expanding market. Analysts were "blown away" by the results, reiterating buy ratings and raising their price targets due to this momentous confirmation of the AI trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Banking Committee approved President Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran, a top White House economic advisor, to the Federal Reserve Board by a 13-11 party-line vote. This advancement occurred a day after a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump from firing another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, and a week before the Fed board's crucial meeting on potential interest rate cuts. Trump has publicly demanded these cuts for months, criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. If confirmed, Miran would serve until January 2026, but Democrats expressed concern over his plan to take an unpaid leave from his current advisory role rather than resigning.</p>

Potbelly, which currently operates more than 445 stores across the U.S. and has an ambitious goal of reaching 2,000, views this acquisition as a strategic move to accelerate its franchise-led growth. RaceTrac, a family-owned company operating over 800 convenience stores, aligns with Potbelly's mission and delivers certain and immediate value to its shareholders.</p>

          <p>Former acting ICE Chief Jonathan Fahey detailed expectations for "Operation Midway Blitz" in Chicago, indicating it will primarily target "known targets" with criminal records and gang affiliations. This federal surge aligns with President Trump's broader efforts to crack down on crime in sanctuary cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. However, Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor JB Pritzker have vehemently opposed federal intervention, citing concerns over due process and potential human rights violations by ICE. A recent Supreme Court ruling temporarily blocking a similar injunction in Los Angeles could legally bolster the federal government's enforcement efforts in Illinois.</p>

          <p>Uber is expanding its ride-sharing services to the skies by partnering with electric air taxi maker Joby Aviation to offer helicopter rides. This new feature, anticipated to roll out as early as next year, will allow users in "most populated cities in the world" to book flights directly through the Uber app. The initiative follows Joby's recent acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, which already provides helicopter and seaplane services in areas like New York for approximately $195 per flight. This collaboration builds on an existing business relationship between Uber and Joby, dating back to 2019, to integrate aerial ride-sharing into the platform.</p>

          <p>Online lender Klarna priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, exceeding its anticipated range and valuing the Swedish company at approximately $15 billion. The IPO successfully raised $1.37 billion, with $200 million directed to the company and the remainder to existing shareholders seeking to exit positions. Klarna, widely recognized for its "buy now, pay later" products, will list on the New York Stock Exchange under "KLAR," aiming to rebrand itself as a digital retail bank. Despite a widening net loss in the second quarter, the successful IPO reflects an increased market appetite for tech companies, though its plans were initially delayed by U.S. tariff announcements.

          <p>U.S. wholesale prices, as measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI), unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrasting sharply with economists' expectations for a rise.

The core PPI, excluding volatile food and energy, also dropped by 0.1%, further strengthening market expectations for the first rate cut since December 2024. This data, combined with recent weak jobs reports, reinforces the likelihood of an easing cycle, despite President Trump's continued criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

Trump emphasized his administration's priority on securing the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas.

          <p>Homeowners are increasingly considering using home equity to pay off student loans, a strategy that can potentially simplify repayment and reduce interest rates, particularly for high-interest private loans. However, financial experts caution about the significant risks involved, as home equity loans are secured by the home, risking foreclosure if payments are defaulted on. Furthermore, federal student loan benefits, such as forgiveness programs, forbearance, and deferral options, would be irrevocably lost. Borrowers must also account for substantial fees and closing costs, making a careful comparison of all potential costs and benefits crucial before pursuing this option. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage and refinance interest rates remain higher than in previous years, with average rates at 6.58% for a 30-year mortgage and 6.73% for a 30-year refinance as of September 10, 2025. Experts suggest rates may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses future hikes, offering some potential relief to borrowers. To secure the most favorable rates, individuals are strongly advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and to diligently compare offers from multiple lenders. Understanding all loan terms, fees, and closing costs is crucial to ensure affordability and avoid unexpected long-term expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, anticipates further "embarrassing" correspondence between himself and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein will be published. This follows the recent release of documents including a letter where Mandelson called Epstein his "best pal," written over two decades ago. Mandelson expressed "tremendous regret" for his friendship with the "charismatic criminal liar" and profound sympathy for his victims, likening the association to an "albatross." Despite calls for his resignation from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, the Prime Minister has retained confidence in Mandelson, stating that full due process was followed during his appointment.</p>

Google monetizes AI through consumption-based pricing for infrastructure and models, where customers pay per token or based on business value like "deflection rates" for customer service systems. Subscription tiers for products like Gemini and Google Workspace also contribute significantly. Upselling existing customers who expand their use of AI services further drives revenue growth, with nearly two-thirds of customers already meaningfully utilizing Google Cloud's AI tools.</p>

This incident adds to a grim toll, with more than 20 lives lost in the Channel this year and over 50,000 crossings since Labour came into power in July 2024.

          <p>An analysis suggests Russia is experiencing a slow-motion decline due to its war in Ukraine, effectively losing not to Ukraine but to the rest of the world. Despite tactical military gains, Russia faces a permanently hostile, Western-armed neighbor, a gutted army, and increasing reliance on China for supplies and finance. The conflict has weakened its influence in former spheres like the South Caucasus and Syria, while unifying and strengthening NATO. The article posits that Russia's wartime economy, focused on artillery over modern technology, is a "fortress economy" fortified against the future, trapping the Kremlin in a war it cannot afford to win or lose.</p>

This serious charge relates to a video file recovered by officers in February during their ongoing investigation.
