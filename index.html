          <h2>Bondi Predicts Trump Will Likely Leave After Second Term</h2>

          <p>Pam Bondi, President Trump's attorney general, suggested that Trump would "probably" leave the White House after a second term, though she left room for the possibility of him serving longer. She noted that changing the Constitution to allow for more than two terms would be a "heavy lift". Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the revocation of all visas for South Sudanese passport holders due to the government's failure to accept repatriated citizens. This decision reflects ongoing diplomatic tensions and immigration policy adjustments under the Trump administration.</p>

While some countries, like Indonesia and Taiwan, indicated they would not retaliate, China announced its own tariffs on US imports. The UK Prime Minister has expressed concerns about the tariffs, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump to discuss trade.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump’s reposting of a video that claimed he’s purposely crashing the stock market, the president’s top economic adviser on Sunday denied that’s his strategy. On ABC News’ “This Week,” anchor George Stephanopoulos pointed out the post on Trump’s Truth Social platform to White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and asked if he was trying to drive markets down to force the Fed to lower interest rates. Pressed by Stephanopoulos on the post, Hassett said the White House respected the Fed’s independence and denied that Trump was trying to pressure it to lower rates.</p>

          <p>Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Rally, has called her embezzlement conviction a "witch hunt" at a rally in Paris. She claims the ruling, which bans her from running for office for five years, is a "political decision" and has appealed the verdict. The conviction relates to the embezzlement of EU funds between 2004 and 2016. Other right-wing leaders have expressed support for Le Pen, while critics defend the court's impartiality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under Trump and Musk, billionaires wield unprecedented influence over US national security. Musk and Bezos are in a position during the Trump administration to personally exert significant influence over the direction of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the rest of the US national security apparatus. Anticipating big rewards, Musk is reportedly joining forces with other pro-Trump billionaires to try to carve up the defense and intelligence business. It is hard to separate Silicon Valley’s calls for breaking up the oligarchy now controlling the defense and intelligence business from the eagerness of pro-Trump tech bros to grab as much power and cash as possible while creating a new oligarchy of their own.</p>
