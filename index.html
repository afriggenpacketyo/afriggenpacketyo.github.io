          <p>Economists predict that President Trump's new tariffs will likely lead to increased inflation and potential economic slowdown.  While a recession isn't considered certain, the risk has increased. The impact on consumers will vary, with some prices rising while businesses absorb some of the costs.  The potential for retaliatory tariffs from other countries further complicates the economic outlook. (not investment advice) <br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while economists often criticize tariffs, a strategic and predictable approach can benefit national interests.  The author draws parallels to historical figures like Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln, who advocated for protectionist trade policies.
