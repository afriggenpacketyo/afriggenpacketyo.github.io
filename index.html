        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has reiterated threats to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies, a move that could severely impact Britain's already struggling film sector. The UK industry, a significant economic contributor, relies heavily on U.S. partnerships, with 65% of production spending from American studios. Experts question the practicality of such tariffs, suggesting alternative incentives like tax credits might achieve similar goals without damaging international collaboration. The British government has yet to take definitive action, despite calls for the issue to be prioritized in trade discussions.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced an independent inquiry into "repeated failures" at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity units, following a BBC investigation revealing potentially avoidable harm to at least 56 babies and two mothers. Over 70 families have shared traumatic care experiences, with some cases dating back over 15 years. The Care Quality Commission downgraded the units to "inadequate," citing a "blame culture." Bereaved families are advocating for Donna Ockenden, who led similar reviews, to chair the Leeds inquiry.</p>

          <p>Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator, has won Bolivia's presidential election with 54% of the vote, defeating right-wing rival Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga. Paz's victory marks a significant shift after two decades of Movement Toward Socialism party rule, driven by voter frustration over economic crisis and the dollar shortage. He plans to implement gradual free-market reforms while maintaining social benefits, aiming to stabilize the economy without triggering widespread unrest. His win sets Bolivia on an uncertain path as it grapples with high inflation and fuel shortages.</p>

          <p>Former England striker Wayne Rooney asserts that Liverpool's British-record signing, Alexander Isak, does not merit a starting position over teammate Hugo Ekitike. Isak, who joined from Newcastle for £125m, has only scored one goal in seven appearances, while Ekitike has netted four. Rooney suggests Isak's lack of pre-season training due to his transfer may be impacting his performance. This critique comes as Liverpool faces its first four-game losing streak since 2014, with pressure mounting on manager Arne Slot.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough by capturing the intricate "kiss-shrink-run" process of neuronal communication using the world's first camera with nanometer resolution and millisecond-scale imaging speed. This groundbreaking research, published in Science, resolves a half-century-old debate among neuroscientists. The findings, led by biologists from USTC and Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, shed new light on how the brain's billions of neurons efficiently transmit signals via synaptic vesicles, a process previously elusive due to its rapid and microscopic nature.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in "No Kings" rallies across the U.S. and worldwide to protest President Trump's policies, including crackdowns on undocumented migrants and deployment of National Guard troops. Demonstrators, carrying signs like "Resist Fascism," expressed outrage over actions they perceive as authoritarian. Republicans criticized the events as "Hate America" rallies, but organizers emphasized a "fierce love for our country." While mostly peaceful, some protests, like in Portland, saw tensions with federal agents. Trump dismissed the protests as a "joke" and "not representative of this country."</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen, after his dominant performance at the United States Grand Prix, now openly acknowledges his strong chance of winning a fifth consecutive Formula 1 world championship. Despite being significantly behind McLaren drivers earlier in the season, Verstappen has gained 64 points in the last four races, narrowing the gap to Oscar Piastri. His recent success is attributed to car upgrades and a better understanding of the vehicle. With five races remaining, Verstappen and his team are approaching the challenge with "positive pressure," aiming for perfection to secure the title.</p>

          <p>Bereaved families are demanding a public inquiry into the UK government's alleged "repeated failures" to protect vulnerable individuals from a website promoting suicide. A report by the Molly Rose Foundation claims authorities were warned 65 times about the forum, which is linked to at least 133 deaths in the UK from a toxic chemical. Concerns include the Home Office's refusal to tighten regulation, Ofcom's reliance on voluntary measures, and operational shortcomings. Families argue a public inquiry is crucial to implement necessary changes and ensure accountability for these ignored warnings.</p>

His whistleblower complaint highlights concerns from various courts about the Justice Department's conduct under the current administration.

          <p>Thirteen people were arrested in West Hollywood's Rainbow District during an operation that initially sparked widespread concerns about an ICE raid due to unmarked vehicles and recent immigration enforcement. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials clarified that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved. The Friday night operation was conducted by local law enforcement in response to multiple reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activity in the area, potentially linked to establishments or unpermitted street vendors.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of RoboSense, a leading LiDAR maker, argues that a multi-sensor system, including LiDAR, is safer and more effective for self-driving vehicles than Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu asserts that vision-only systems cannot achieve Level 3 or 4 automation due to limitations in complex scenarios, such as identifying white cars against a bright sky or dark cars in tunnels. He also notes that LiDAR costs have significantly decreased, making it a viable and critical component for advanced autonomous driving, a view shared by other auto executives.</p>

          <p>A California farmer painfully witnessed a winery dump his truckloads of grapes after they were rejected for failing to meet quality specifications, a consequence of climate volatility. Subtle shifts in humidity, sunlight, or rainfall can alter crop chemistry, impacting small growers who often rely on single-buyer contracts. This incident underscores the financial risks for those dependent on one income source and highlights the importance of diversification and insurance. It also signals a "climate premium" for agribusiness investors, urging reassessment of regional exposure and support for local supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eighteen decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a massive statue of General Robert E. Lee, are now part of a powerful art exhibit in Los Angeles. Curated by Hamza Walker, "Monuments" aims to confront the warring narratives of American history by displaying the melted-down bronze and graffitied statues alongside contemporary art. This initiative directly challenges President Trump's call to reinstall such monuments, arguing they promote the "Lost Cause" ideology and white supremacy. The exhibit offers a reinterpretation of controversial symbols, fostering dialogue about their historical and cultural impact.</p>

          <p>Career coaches and experts suggest a simple language shift, replacing "I can't" with "I don't," to effectively set boundaries at work and prevent burnout. "I don't" is presented as a more definitive and less negotiable phrase, empowering individuals to protect their personal time. This advice comes as research indicates a significant increase in workers experiencing high stress or pressure. The article emphasizes adjusting goals to current capacity and highlights the importance of self-care and therapy, as demonstrated by TV chef Lorraine Pascale's experience with burnout.</p>
