          <p>Bethany Clarke is urging increased education about the dangers of methanol poisoning after her friend, Simone White, tragically died while they were traveling in Laos. The two women consumed vodka shots offered at a hostel, which later proved to contain the deadly substance. Clarke is now petitioning for schools in the UK to include lessons on the risks of bootleg alcohol, emphasizing the need for awareness and caution when drinking abroad. She hopes to prevent similar tragedies by educating teenagers about the symptoms and potential dangers of methanol poisoning.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump voiced his disapproval of the recent Russian strikes on Kyiv, labeling them as unnecessary and poorly timed amidst ongoing peace negotiations. He called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the attacks, citing the high number of casualties on both sides. Trump reiterated his belief that Russia desires peace and highlighted his administration's previous efforts to broker a deal. However, he also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for refusing to consider ceding Russian-occupied Crimea, further complicating the already tense situation.</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England's governor, highlighted the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on the UK's economic growth, particularly if global trade slows down. The central bank is carefully considering the effects of tariffs on both growth and inflation as it approaches its May monetary policy meeting. Bailey acknowledged the UK's weak growth but emphasized that the uncertainty surrounding trade is a new factor to consider. He also stated that he does not believe the UK is currently on the brink of a recession, despite the economic uncertainty affecting business and consumer confidence.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, addressed the surprising cost associated with users adding polite phrases like "please" and "thank you" to their chatbot prompts. While seemingly trivial, these extra words contribute to increased electricity costs due to the additional processing required by the servers. Altman humorously acknowledged the expense, stating that the tens of millions of dollars spent on this were "well spent," implying a value in user experience or perhaps in the data gathered about human-AI interaction.

          <p>Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack advised policymakers to exercise patience in evaluating the effects of tariffs on inflation and economic growth. She emphasized the current high level of uncertainty and refrained from committing to a specific course of action regarding interest rate policy. Hammack expressed concerns about potential conflicts between the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining price stability and full employment. She also noted that uncertainty is weighing on businesses, causing them to pause investment and hiring plans. Hammack does not vote this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee but will vote in 2026.</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates, a prominent hedge fund, issued a warning that President Trump's policies aimed at reshaping the global economy could negatively impact the economy and financial assets. The firm's co-chief investment officers cited a "rapid shift to modern mercantilism" as a cause for concern, anticipating a policy-induced slowdown and an increased risk of recession. They also suggested that these policies could create risks for U.S. assets, which heavily rely on foreign investment. The hedge fund advised investors to be wary of the potential for economic weakness, equity underperformance, and U.S. underperformance relative to the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>Russia has returned the body of Victoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist who was captured in occupied east Ukraine and died in Russian custody. Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 while reporting in the Moscow-held part of the Zaporizhzhia region and her body was returned as part of an exchange at the end of February. A joint investigation revealed she was arrested in Energodar, held in Melitopol, and transferred to a jail in Taganrog, where she reportedly stopped eating and had knife wounds on her body. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned Moscow for Roshchina's death, holding them responsible.</p>

A Chinese official stated that no trade talks have occurred with the U.S., despite claims from the Trump administration. The trade war has intensified, with China retaliating by returning Boeing planes it had ordered from the U.S. China's Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong emphasized that the U.S. should eliminate all "unilateral tariff measures" against China.</p>

Over 60 Labour MPs have urged ministers to establish a "new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30."

          <p>As investors brace for stock market volatility amid tariff uncertainty, experts recommend a "bond ladder" strategy to preserve retirement savings. This allocation involves bonds with staggered maturities, providing emotional comfort and stability, especially for those entering retirement. As each bond matures, investors can either spend or reinvest the principal into a new, longer-term bond, based on their needs. This approach can be particularly useful during periods of stock market volatility, offering a more stable investment option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With Warren Buffett holding a record amount of cash, experts are advising investors on how to balance cash and investments amid market uncertainty. A traditional 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds typically outperforms cash in the long run, but investors often seek the safety of cash during uncertain times. While cash can be a good portfolio diversifier, especially with higher interest rates, it is best held outside the portfolio for emergency funds or near-term expenses. Retirees may want to keep one to two years' worth of withdrawals in cash, but making radical portfolio shifts can backfire. (not investment advice)</p>
