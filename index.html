          <p>Alibaba's AI coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained popularity, capturing over 20% of the usage share on the AI marketplace OpenRouter. This places it second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, which is widely considered the industry benchmark for AI-assisted coding. The model's strong performance is attributed to extensive training on coding-related data, enhanced data quality, and large-scale reinforcement learning. Alibaba's entry intensifies competition in the growing AI coding sector, where other Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent are also launching their own tools to capitalize on the trend.</p>

Since last year, ten provincial-level regions have introduced plans focusing on areas like digitalized marine governance, offshore energy, and tourism. For instance, Fujian province is developing a massive marine data platform to aid in decision-making for ecological protection and emergency response. The province also aims to significantly expand its offshore wind and solar power production, building on a decade of development in the sector.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump and several European leaders to discuss ending the war with Russia, though no tangible commitments were finalized. A major topic was the potential for a three-way meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which Trump claimed to have initiated arrangements for via a phone call. The talks also revealed differing views on the necessity of a ceasefire before negotiations, with European leaders pushing for one while Trump seemed to dismiss it as a prerequisite. Trump also hinted at providing security guarantees for Ukraine, stating Europe would be the "first line of defence" but the U.S. would also be "involved."</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old Indiana woman, Nathalie Rose Jones, is facing federal charges for allegedly posting multiple violent threats against President Donald Trump on social media. The Justice Department reported that the threats, posted on Instagram and Facebook, included a desire to "disembowel" the president. During an interview with the Secret Service, Jones allegedly admitted she would kill Trump if given the opportunity, citing a desire to avenge lives lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. The charges include threatening the life of the President and transmitting threats in interstate commerce, which U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro described as a very serious crime.</p>

          <p>The Apalachee High School football team in Winder, Georgia, achieved its first win in nearly four years, offering a moment of hope to a community still healing from a tragic school shooting. The team had been on a long losing streak and was also coping with the trauma of an event 11 months prior that killed four people, including their defensive coordinator. New head coach Kevin Saunders, with the help of a mental performance coach, worked to change the team's culture and help players process their grief. The 29-9 victory was a deeply meaningful event, demonstrating how sports can help a community rally and begin to heal.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Trump announced he had called Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin arranging a direct meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. Trump stated that this bilateral meeting would be followed by a trilateral summit including himself. While Trump presented this as a significant step, the Kremlin's official statement was more reserved, mentioning support for continued negotiations and the possibility of increasing the level of representation, without confirming a direct Putin-Zelenskyy meeting. This development comes after previous attempts to orchestrate such a high-level meeting failed, with Putin declining to attend past talks.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department over a new rule that ties federal grants for crime victims to immigration enforcement cooperation. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally withholding over $1 billion in annual funding for services like crisis centers and domestic abuse hotlines to coerce states into assisting federal immigration agents. The states, mostly Democratic-led, claim this policy forces them to choose between forfeiting critical resources for vulnerable victims or complying with unlawful conditions that erode trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. They are seeking an urgent injunction as grant application deadlines are imminent.</p>

The killing is portrayed as part of a revenge plot initiated by Anthony "Big Jook" Mims over diss tracks. A key witness is Cornelius Smith Jr., one of the admitted shooters, who testified that Govan hired him for the "hit."

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to fundamentally realign the league geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that grouping teams into divisions based on location, such as an Eastern and Western Conference, could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason formats. While this could face resistance from traditionalists, the commissioner argued it would create better broadcast opportunities for West Coast audiences. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process approved by 2029, with Nashville and Salt Lake City considered front-runners for new franchises.</p>

The facility is severely overcrowded, with some patients having been there for decades, and staff struggle to cope with a surge in admissions.

The article questions the mission's unclear objectives, noting that with no stated goal for the intervention beyond a general crackdown on crime, there is no clear endpoint, raising concerns it could continue indefinitely. While President Trump has legal authority over the D.C. National Guard, his allies have suggested this could be an "experiment" for other Democrat-run cities. The analysis suggests the move appears to be an improvisational power grab rather than a structured plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. Previously, when insurers issued checks, lenders would deposit the funds into an escrow account and could keep the interest accrued while rebuilding was underway. Authored by Assemblymember John Harabedian, the new legislation closes this loophole and guarantees homeowners at least 2% interest on these funds. The bill, which now goes to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed, aims to provide additional financial support to homeowners during the difficult recovery process.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist who discovered the coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, has warned that another pandemic is inevitable. He expressed concern that the world may not be significantly better prepared than it was before COVID-19. Peiris highlighted the increasing frequency of animal viruses jumping to humans, with respiratory viruses posing a particular threat for spawning the next global health crisis. He emphasized that the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the massive destructive potential of such events, not only to health but also to global economic and social stability, urging for greater attention to future preparedness.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent fired at a moving vehicle in San Bernardino County after the driver sped off during an immigration stop. The Department of Homeland Security stated the driver refused to roll down his window and struck two agents as he fled, prompting one agent to fire in self-defense, though no one was hit. An advocate for the family, who were in the car, provided video showing agents smashing the vehicle's windows before the driver sped away and shots were heard. Local police did not detain the driver, citing California's sanctuary laws, a decision DHS criticized as shielding criminals.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan have returned to the state capital, declaring their protest a victory. By leaving the state, they broke the legislature's quorum, temporarily halting the process. While Republicans are expected to pass the new maps, aimed at increasing their majority in the U.S. House, Democrats claim they successfully raised national awareness and are now prepared to challenge the "racist map" in court. This move is part of a larger national battle, as Democrat-led states like California are now pushing their own redistricting plans to counteract potential GOP gains in Texas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent announcement that he will use an executive order to ban mail-in ballots and voting machines represents a significant departure from the traditional Republican principle of states' rights. In his statement, Trump claimed that states are "merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government" and must do as the president tells them. This article argues that this assertion is a novel interpretation of the Constitution, which grants states and Congress, not the president, authority over election administration. The move is presented as the latest example of Trump's attempts to centralize power and impose federal will on states, a stance contrary to decades of conservative orthodoxy.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes meeting in Washington, President Trump announced a proposal for a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but Moscow's response has been noncommittal. While Trump suggested he initiated arrangements, the Kremlin only indicated it would consider "raising the level" of negotiations. The summit, attended by numerous European leaders, highlighted a push for the U.S. to pressure Russia. European leaders also stressed the need for a ceasefire, a point Trump appeared to back away from after his recent meeting with Putin, and sought clarity on U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and the continent.</p>

          <p>General David Allvin, the United States Air Force chief of staff, has unexpectedly announced his intention to retire, effective around November 1. The reason for his departure was not provided, but the move is surprising as he will have served only two years of the typical four-year term for the position. In a statement, Allvin expressed gratitude for the opportunity to lead the service and for the faith placed in him by military and administration leaders. It remains unclear whether the decision to retire was his own or if he was asked to step down by Pentagon leadership under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the geopolitical significance of China's plan to build a new, large-scale embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London. The author argues that diplomatic buildings are potent symbols of national power and ambition, and this project sends a clear message about China's rising status and its view of London as a key global capital. The piece contrasts China's long-term diplomatic investment with the UK's recent trend of selling off prime diplomatic real estate for short-term financial gain. The proposal, while facing some political opposition over security concerns, is framed as a test of Britain's international standing and its complex relationship with China.</p>

It explores the societal costs, including job anxiety, the spread of synthetic "slop" online, and the potential for cognitive debt among users.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Bankrate reveals that, on average, American wages have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, meaning the typical worker's purchasing power has decreased. This finding aligns with public sentiment, as a majority of Americans feel their income has not kept up with the rising cost of living. The report indicates that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind than others, while jobs in high-demand sectors like leisure, hospitality, and healthcare have seen wage growth outpace inflation. Overall wage dissatisfaction is at its lowest level since 2014, reflecting ongoing financial strain for many households. (not investment advice)</p>
