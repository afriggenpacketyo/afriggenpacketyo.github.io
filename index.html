          <p>Meta Platforms has launched a standalone AI application powered by its Llama AI model, directly competing with platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini. The app includes a Discover feed showcasing user interactions and image creation capabilities. This move follows Meta's integration of an AI chatbot into its existing apps in April, replacing the search feature on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. CEO Mark Zuckerberg aims for Meta AI to reach over a billion users in 2025, with current monthly active users around 700 million. The company plans to invest significantly in AI infrastructure, with first-quarter earnings coming soon.</p>

          <p>Following his Liberal Party's victory in the Canadian election, Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged to confront the US on trade issues. Carney, who recently succeeded Justin Trudeau as party leader, will continue in his role, potentially reshuffling his cabinet. The Liberals may form a minority government, requiring deals with other parties like the Bloc Québécois and NDP to pass legislation. Key priorities include navigating relations with US President Donald Trump, securing Canada's economy amidst tariff headwinds, and hosting the G7 summit in Alberta. The Liberals plan to introduce tax cuts for the middle class and streamline approval for energy projects.</p>

          <p>Amazon has reversed course on a plan to display import charges on ultra-discount items sold through its Haul platform, following White House backlash. The initial consideration was reportedly in response to Trump's removal of the de minimis trade loophole, not his 145% tariff on imports from China. The White House criticized the reported plan as a "hostile and political act," questioning why Amazon didn't take similar action during periods of high inflation under the Biden administration. Amazon is currently assessing the impact of Trump's tariffs on third-party sellers, with some already raising prices and reducing advertising spend.</p>

The expert emphasizes that introverts' discomfort in social situations drives them to think more deeply and choose their words carefully, resulting in more precise and impactful communication.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has triggered economic uncertainty with a torrent of executive orders and unprecedented tariffs, particularly a 145% tariff on China-made products. Despite promises of prosperity, markets have tumbled, the US dollar has weakened, and global trade has been disrupted, raising concerns about a potential recession. Economists estimate a significant likelihood of a US recession in 2025, with many warning of a global downturn. While Trump touts his policies as transformative, critics argue his unpredictable approach is inflicting economic, social, and diplomatic damage, leading to a 59% disapproval rating.</p>

          <p>General Motors exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but is reassessing its 2025 financial guidance due to potential cost increases and industry uncertainty stemming from Donald Trump's auto tariffs. The company is suspending additional stock buybacks until it gains clarity on the economic and regulatory environments. While GM believes it can offset some North American tariffs, it is deferring significant manufacturing changes until there is more certainty. The tariffs, including those on aluminum and steel, have created instability, leading analysts to downgrade automotive stocks.

The company had previously announced an agreement with Amazon to reduce delivery volume by over 50% in the second half of 2026.

The Navy is investigating the incident, and it is unclear whether there will be an effort to recover the $60 million jet.

While the U.S. ambassador is not expected at the main event, the U.S. Consul General attended a reception with Vietnamese officials. Critics argue this easing is insufficient, citing a lack of understanding about postwar reconciliation and strategic partnership with Vietnam in countering China's influence. The initial ban sparked controversy, with some speculating it was to avoid celebrating a defeat during Trump's 100th day in office.</p>

          <p>The Vietnam War fundamentally altered perceptions of war, particularly its long-term psychological and social consequences. The recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) emerged from studies of Vietnam veterans, highlighting the invisible wounds carried by soldiers. While PTSD can be treated, its impact can last for decades, and the societal response to war plays a crucial role in overcoming trauma. Vietnam's communist party dictates what can be said about the war, limiting discussion of psychological problems and prioritizing a heroic narrative. There is also reconciliation, albeit with a strange asymmetry. While the Americans are welcome, there is still the “big problem of reconciliation” with the former South Vietnamese opponent.</p>

          <p>The killing of 26 people in Pahalgam, Kashmir, has reignited tensions between India and Pakistan, with both countries trading accusations and threats. The attack, seemingly targeting individuals based on their religion, has shattered the facade of normality in the region. Kashmiris, who have long been caught in the crossfire, have little say in their future. The incident underscores the unresolved dispute over Kashmir and the high price Kashmiris pay for the strained relationship between India and Pakistan. The article advocates for consultation with the Kashmiri people to break the cycle of violence.</p>

          <h2>EU Gas Imports: Why Iran Is Excluded Despite Vast Reserves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 11:27:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the EU's efforts to diversify its energy supply after the Ukraine invasion, Iran remains excluded from its gas trade due to sanctions and political complexities. While the EU imports gas from Russia, Libya, and Qatar, Iran's vast reserves remain untapped. Sanctions deter investment in Iran's energy infrastructure, making it expensive to extract and transport gas to Europe. Although Iran exports oil to countries like China, European companies cannot risk trading directly with Iran due to potential penalties. The 2015 nuclear agreement offered a path to normalization, but the US withdrawal and reimposition of sanctions hindered progress.</p>

          <p>Amnesty International and the Kenya Human Rights Commission are calling for investigations into the killing of protesters by Kenya's security forces, following a BBC Africa Eye documentary. The documentary revealed how security forces responded to protesters who breached Kenya's parliament in June 2024, resulting in multiple deaths. The rights groups urge the police and army to publicly state actions being taken regarding the documentary's findings. The Kenyan government has defended its actions, stating that the police watchdog is conducting an investigation and criticized the BBC documentary for being "one-sided".</p>

          <p>Significant budget cuts and staff reductions at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under the Trump administration could drastically alter the agency's ability to protect consumers. With the agency potentially shrinking to a 200-person staff, many of its current efforts, including capping bank overdraft fees and regulating payment apps, are in doubt. Supporters of the CFPB worry that these cuts will leave consumers vulnerable and reduce the effectiveness of the consumer complaint database. Analysts anticipate a changed regulatory landscape, with some payment apps evading oversight and reduced enforcement of consumer protection laws.</p>

The photographs prevented the public from forgetting the human toll, as during this fierce firefight south of the DMZ in October 1966.
