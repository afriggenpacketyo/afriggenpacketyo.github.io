          <p>A federal jury in New York found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty on two counts of transporting women across state lines for prostitution, charges that each carry a maximum 10-year sentence. However, he was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking involving his ex-girlfriend Casandra "Cassie" Ventura and another woman. The split verdict followed a seven-week trial featuring graphic testimony about drug-fueled sex parties and abuse. Combs' legal team is seeking his immediate release pending sentencing, arguing this is his first conviction.</p>

          <p>The House faces significant hurdles in passing President Trump's agenda bill due to key changes made by the Senate. Major sticking points include deeper cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO estimates would leave more people uninsured than the House version, and a larger increase to the national debt. Some conservative Republicans have voiced opposition to the increased deficit, while moderate members are concerned about the Medicaid provisions. Disagreements over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction and the removal of certain green energy repeals further complicate the bill's path to final passage.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is set to vote on a massive domestic policy bill central to President Trump's agenda after it narrowly passed the Senate. The legislation extends tax cuts while making significant spending cuts to health care and nutrition programs, and boosting funds for border security and defense. The process faces resistance not only from Democrats, who are using procedural tactics to delay the vote, but also from some conservative Republicans who are concerned about the Senate's changes. With a slim Republican majority, party leadership is pressuring members to pass the bill before the July 4th holiday.</p>

The deal brings a conclusion to a case that has drawn intense national media attention, avoiding a lengthy and painful trial for the victims' families.

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for hormone therapy can increase the risk of breast cancer in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research indicated that using estrogen alone, a treatment suitable for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines previous understandings from older studies and highlights the importance of the specific type and timing of hormone therapy. Medical experts stress that patients should discuss these findings with their doctors to weigh the risks and benefits for their individual situations.</p>

In a statement, Adm Key expressed deep regret for his actions, which reportedly involved an affair with a junior colleague, and accepted the decision.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through Vietnam to avoid other duties. In exchange, the agreement grants the United States tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets for American products. The deal comes ahead of a deadline that could have seen U.S. duties on Vietnamese goods rise to a much higher rate under Trump's reciprocal tariff policy. Critics note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, potentially raising costs for U.S. consumers and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest version of President Trump's spending bill includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade, which could cause an estimated 11.8 million people to lose their health insurance. The cuts stem primarily from a new national work requirement for beneficiaries and restrictions on how states can fund their Medicaid programs through provider taxes. Health policy experts warn these changes would represent a historic rollback of health coverage and could threaten the financial viability of rural hospitals, which heavily rely on Medicaid funding to operate. The bill also includes a provision exempting more rare-disease drugs from Medicare price negotiations.</p>

The legislation funds thousands of new enforcement officers, tens of thousands of additional detention beds, and new fees for asylum applications. This massive increase in funding would make ICE the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency.

This move directly challenges Beijing, which passed a law in 2007 claiming authority over the selection process.

Bass has publicly condemned the federal actions and the Justice Department's lawsuit against the city's sanctuary policies, vowing not to be intimidated. Political analysts note that this confrontational approach is a shift for Bass, who is typically a consensus-builder, but may be a necessary recalibration when dealing with Trump. Her firm stance is seen as unifying many Angelenos and even some state Republicans against what they view as federal overreach.</p>

          <p>The United States' ability to accurately forecast hurricanes is being threatened by significant cuts to staffing, budgets, and critical data sources, according to this article. The Department of Defense is set to stop distributing imagery from a key satellite sensor that provides "X-ray vision" through clouds, which is vital for detecting a storm's structure and potential for rapid intensification. This loss, combined with fewer weather balloon launches and staff cuts at NOAA, means forecasters have fewer tools and experts just as hurricane season intensifies. Scientists warn these cutbacks are dismantling years of progress and leaving the nation more vulnerable to surprise storms.</p>

          <p>A provision in the latest version of President Trump's "big beautiful bill" would increase the investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%. This move is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to build and expand advanced chip-making facilities within the United States. The enhanced credit builds upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting a continued bipartisan push to onshore the semiconductor supply chain. While Trump has previously criticized the CHIPS Act grants, this new incentive aligns with his preference for using tax policy and tariffs to encourage domestic production.

The administration argues the president has unrestricted authority to remove executive officers, a position it has tested with other independent agencies.

          <p>Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco, accusing the wholesale retailer of selling "knockoff" versions of its popular apparel, including jackets, sweatshirts, and pants. The lawsuit claims that Costco's products are "confusingly similar" and infringe on Lululemon's "trade dress," a form of intellectual property related to a product's distinctive appearance. Lululemon argues that these "dupes" mislead consumers and dilute its brand, which is known for its unique designs and construction. The company is seeking damages and an order for Costco to stop selling the allegedly infringing items.</p>
