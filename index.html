          <p>A 53-year-old man was arrested after a car collided with pedestrians in Liverpool city center during the Liverpool FC victory parade. Eyewitnesses reported the vehicle driving through a crowd, causing people to scatter, though police have stated that the incident is not being treated as terror-related. Twenty-seven people were hospitalized, including children, with two individuals sustaining serious injuries and twenty others treated at the scene. Witnesses described the car moving at a considerable speed and being chased by people attempting to stop it, indicating a chaotic and dangerous situation during what was meant to be a celebratory event.

          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase a combined 110,000 tons of government-stockpiled rice, following the farm minister's announcement to provide rice directly to the market to combat rising prices.

The move comes as supermarket rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, despite government efforts to lower them by releasing reserve rice. The government aims to finalize contracts and begin deliveries soon, with plans to revise eligibility criteria to include smaller supermarkets and rice shops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop in April, plummeting 49% year-on-year, as the company faces brand damage and increased competition. The decline occurred even as overall battery electric car sales in Europe rose by 34.1%, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Tesla has faced reputational challenges due to CEO Elon Musk's involvement with Donald Trump, leading to protests at Tesla dealerships across Europe. Additionally, Tesla is struggling with an aging car lineup and growing competition from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players, with BYD surpassing Tesla in pure electric car sales in Europe for the first time.</p>

Rice plants subjected to cold stress exhibited an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures that was inherited across five generations, driven by DNA methylation changes. This research revives the rivalry between Darwin and Lamarck, whose theory suggested organisms could pass on learned survival traits.

This comes at a time when the industry is already contending with a slowdown in demand and increasing competition from lab-grown diamonds (LGDs). Lab-grown diamonds are chemically identical to mined diamonds but sell at a significant discount, leading to a shift in consumer preferences.

          <p>Legal hurdles are impeding the establishment of a regular organ donation mechanism between Hong Kong and mainland China, despite discussions that began in 2022. According to Wang Haibo, director of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), existing laws, particularly those related to HIV prevention, restrict the transfer of organs across the border. The specific law cited bans the transfer of organs, blood, and tissue, requiring revisions to facilitate cross-border organ donation. COTRS is a national system that allocates organs for transplants throughout China.</p>

While based on Wölk's testimony, some historians question the historical accuracy of the story, as Hitler had a dietician who prepared meals separately.
