          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl as a key reason, while also warning against any retaliatory measures. The move escalates trade tensions despite ongoing negotiations and adds to existing duties on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos. Prime Minister Carney responded by vowing to continue defending Canadian workers and businesses while working toward the new deadline and cooperating on the fentanyl issue.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of decline, according to the Office for National Statistics. This downturn, which defied analysts' predictions of slight growth, is seen as a setback for the government's economic agenda. The primary drivers of the shrinkage were a drop in the manufacturing sector and notably weak retail sales. Despite the monthly decline, the broader economic picture for the three months leading up to May showed a 0.5% growth, though business groups remain concerned about ongoing pressures facing the UK economy.

          <p>The European Union is bracing for further trade disputes with the United States following President Trump's announcement of a 35% tariff on Canadian goods. The move has heightened concerns in Europe, as President Trump indicated that a similar notification letter regarding tariffs would also be sent to the EU. This development casts doubt on the progress of ongoing trade negotiations aimed at averting steep US duties on European exports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. The announcement caused a dip in both EU and US stock futures, signaling market anxiety over the potential for a wider transatlantic trade conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Questions surrounding Novak Djokovic's fitness have emerged ahead of his Wimbledon semi-final match against world number one Jannik Sinner. The 24-time Grand Slam champion cancelled a scheduled practice session on Thursday, raising concerns after he experienced an awkward fall during his quarter-final victory. His opponent, Jannik Sinner, has also been managing an elbow injury sustained earlier in the tournament, though he has stated he will be fully fit for the match. Djokovic, 38, has acknowledged the increasing physical demands of competing at the highest level against younger rivals, adding a layer of uncertainty to the highly anticipated showdown.</p>

However, the council denied the application, stating that the proposed materials and methods would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character.

The moves follow an earlier 90-day pause, but few comprehensive deals have been finalized, creating widespread uncertainty for global economies.

Analysts warn that such a steep levy could inflate production costs, squeeze corporate profits, and lead to higher drug prices and potential shortages for U.S. consumers. The administration has suggested a grace period of 12 to 18 months for companies to reshore manufacturing, but industry experts argue this timeline is insufficient for such a complex transition.

Critics find it "ridiculous" that customers face fines of up to £1,000 for using a hosepipe while the utility provider fails to address its own water wastage.

This trend contrasts sharply with declining sales in countries like Germany, where a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric and role in the Trump administration has impacted the brand.

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has blown up approximately 300 dams and closed numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species whose populations have been devastated by decades of blocked waterways. These structures had severely restricted water flow, blocked migratory routes, and destroyed spawning grounds, causing some river sections to dry up entirely. This large-scale project is intended to rejuvenate the ecosystem in what ecologists consider the last refuge for many unique fish in the upper Yangtze basin.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin significant layoffs, aiming to cut its domestic workforce by approximately 15% as part of a sweeping reorganization by the Trump administration. The reduction will affect around 1,800 U.S.-based positions through both involuntary layoffs and voluntary buyouts, while staff stationed overseas are not currently targeted. The administration claims the cuts are designed to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and focus on core diplomatic priorities by consolidating functions and eliminating redundant offices. Critics and employee associations have expressed alarm, arguing the move could weaken American diplomatic efforts and demoralize the workforce.</p>

          <p>The UK's public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), has reported that Britain's F-35 stealth jet program is being undermined by delays, personnel shortages, and infrastructure gaps. While acknowledging the aircraft's superiority, the NAO stated there has been a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion spent so far. The report also found that plans to equip the jets with key long-range weapons have been delayed until the 2030s. The Ministry of Defence responded that the program is within budget and that two full squadrons will be ready for deployment by the end of the year.</p>

While growth is expected to meet the official 5% target, concerns persist about weak domestic demand and the impact of the U.S. trade war. Many economists argue that achieving the full-year goal will be challenging without more forceful government support. The debate centers on whether Beijing should implement a more proactive fiscal policy to stabilize the economy if rising uncertainties from Washington trigger a significant downturn.

          <p>China is experiencing a significant boom in the adoption of electric-powered heavy trucks, with sales increasing by 175% in the first half of the year. This rapid transition is driven by government subsidies, the expansion of charging infrastructure along industrial corridors, and lower long-term operating costs compared to diesel alternatives. The shift is further curbing the nation's diesel consumption and has led analysts to revise down their diesel demand forecasts. This trend, following the rise of electric cars and LNG trucks, is accelerating the timeline for when China's overall oil demand is expected to peak. (not investment advice)</p>
