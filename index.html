          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, celebrated for his distinctive figurative art over a 75-year career, is now focusing on promoting the work of other artists. At 98, Katz has gifted a collection of over one hundred paintings to the Portland Museum of Art in Maine for an exhibition titled "Painting Energy." This act of philanthropy is rooted in his own early struggles for recognition in an art world dominated by abstract and pop art. By collecting and showcasing pieces from emerging and established artists, Katz aims to provide the support and belief that was crucial to his own journey.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Offers Six Key Phrases to Foster Cooperation in Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child psychology expert Reem Raouda suggests that building long-term cooperation with children hinges on creating a sense of connection and emotional safety, rather than demanding immediate obedience. Based on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, she identifies six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and encourage listening. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative, validating a child's feelings while still maintaining boundaries. This approach aims to make cooperation a natural outcome of a secure and respectful parent-child bond.</p>

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window is heading towards a frantic finale, with several high-profile deals expected before Monday's deadline. Newcastle United's Alexander Isak is reportedly attempting to force a move to Liverpool, a saga that could conclude with a near-record fee. Meanwhile, Arsenal has seemingly hijacked Tottenham's deal for Eberechi Eze. Other potential moves include goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma's exit from PSG, with Manchester clubs interested, and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi being linked to Liverpool, highlighting a period of intense last-minute negotiations across the league.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have concluded that the late McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the 1973 movie "Walking Tall," murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged it to look like an ambush by his enemies. A cold case review by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation uncovered major inconsistencies between Pusser's account and the physical evidence.

          <p>The Israeli military has confirmed that a recent airstrike killed Abu Obeida, a prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, marking the latest high-profile elimination of a Hamas leader. This development occurs as Israel continues its major offensive in Gaza City, which has prompted warnings of a humanitarian crisis from international aid organizations. Tensions in the wider region remain high, with reports of an Israeli strike killing the Houthi prime minister in Yemen and activists, including Greta Thunberg, planning an aid flotilla to challenge the blockade on Gaza.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking Britain's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The deal is expected to support 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates.

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly disrupting the labor market, with a notable impact on entry-level positions and recent graduates. According to data from Indeed, overall job postings have declined by 6.7% year-over-year, with tech jobs seeing a 36% drop compared to pre-pandemic levels. While AI can automate tasks in fields like coding, accounting, and copywriting, it is less likely to replace jobs requiring empathy or physicality, such as healthcare and skilled trades. Economists suggest that while AI will displace some roles, it will also create new, currently unforeseen job categories, advising job seekers to focus on networking and gaining practical experience.</p>

He drew parallels between Springsteen's internal struggles and his Emmy-winning role as Carmy in "The Bear," noting both characters grapple with generational trauma.

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores innovative approaches to understanding and treating chronic pain. He highlights the shift towards "reverse translational research," which starts with a patient's real-world experience rather than a laboratory setting. This method has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of individual pain for the first time, creating objective biomarkers for a subjective experience. These breakthroughs are leading to advanced treatments like deep brain stimulation (DBS) that can predict and intercept pain signals in the brain, offering new hope for millions.</p>

The article argues that, much like during the Cold War, adversaries now hold each other's populations hostage under the threat of nuclear destruction, with war potentially just one button press away. The author suggests that while the fundamental logic of war remains, its nature has been radically transformed by technology, increasing the scale of potential suffering.

Experts warn that if the president succeeds in stacking the board with loyalists, it could undermine the credibility of U.S. monetary policy and the stability of the financial system. Control over the Fed's board would grant the executive branch influence over interest rates, bank regulation, and the integrity of the U.S. dollar, a shift that critics say could lead to economic instability similar to that seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

          <p>Researchers have resolved a long-standing debate by identifying the comb jelly as the first animal to branch off from the common ancestor of all animals, a split that occurred around 600 million years ago. For years, scientists debated whether sea sponges or comb jellies held this distinction. Using new chromosomal analysis techniques, the study compared the gene arrangements of both creatures to their closest non-animal relatives. The comb jelly's chromosomes showed the least amount of genetic rearrangement, indicating it diverged earlier, making it the evolutionary "sister" to all other animals on Earth.</p>

The royal brothers, sent to a military school near Santa Cruz, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the sport, then known as "surfboard swimming," at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their feats were documented in a local newspaper and inspired locals to take up the activity. This historical event predates the more famous popularization of surfing by Duke Kahanamoku in the early 20th century.</p>

The discussion was amplified after US Senator Roger Wicker, during a visit to Taipei, stated he expects such cooperation to move forward. For decades, the U.S. has sold arms to Taiwan, but co-production on the island would represent a significant escalation in defense ties. While seen by the U.S. and Taiwan as a strategic advantage to bolster the island's defenses, Beijing views it as a provocative move that challenges its sovereignty claims.</p>

          <p>States like Rhode Island and Montana are implementing new taxes on high-value second homes, sparking criticism from real estate professionals and wealthy property owners. Rhode Island's new levy, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax," imposes a surcharge on non-primary residences valued over $1 million, significantly increasing property tax bills for owners in affluent communities. Critics argue these taxes unfairly penalize seasonal residents who contribute heavily to local economies without using many public services, potentially driving them to invest in other states.

          <p>As part of its ongoing efforts to combat plastic pollution, the state of South Australia will ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers starting Monday. These iconic, single-use plastic items are a staple in many takeaway restaurants but are difficult to recycle due to their small size. The ban is an extension of previous legislation that targeted other single-use plastics like straws and bags. Officials emphasize that while the containers are used for mere seconds, they can persist in the environment for centuries, harming marine life.</p>

An archival report details their relationship, which began at a party and quickly blossomed into a lifelong artistic partnership. While Katz's detached, stylistic approach to portraiture was initially met with criticism in a world of abstract expressionism, his focus on Ada's distinct look became his signature. Curators note that his interest lies more in style and appearance than emotional depth, allowing viewers to see themselves reflected in his iconic paintings of his muse.</p>

Abruzzo fears these moves, coupled with legal challenges from companies like SpaceX, could roll back labor protections to pre-1935 levels and empower corporations to violate labor laws without consequence, urging states and the public to push back.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay by Avram Alpert addresses the common modern dilemma of feeling guilty for personal happiness while the world faces numerous crises. Drawing on ancient religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that feeling the pain of others is a moral response. However, this same principle suggests we should also be open to feeling their joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or *mudita*. The piece concludes that embracing both the world's horrors and its delights is not a contradiction but a necessary part of being a connected human, and that feeling good can be a form of resistance.</p>

Critics fear that major changes, or potential abolishment of the program as a related bill proposes, could expose vaccine makers to extensive litigation, causing them to exit the market and reduce vaccine availability. While Kennedy can't unilaterally dismantle the program, he could alter its operations, such as by changing the table of recognized injuries or directing DOJ lawyers to concede more claims, thereby undermining public trust in vaccinations.</p>

The challenge has intensified with a season-ending knee injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater, placing Herbert's blind side protection in the hands of rookie Joe Alt. The team's strategy under Harbaugh will also heavily feature a physical running game to complement Herbert's passing ability.</p>
