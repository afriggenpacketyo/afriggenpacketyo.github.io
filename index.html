        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of 43 British peers, including prominent lawyers, has warned the UK government that recognizing a Palestinian state could breach international law. They argue in a letter that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria of the Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. The government defended its position, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 UN members already recognize Palestine. The move is part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to push for a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened Canada with trade repercussions following its announcement to recognize Palestinian statehood in September. Trump stated on social media that Canada's decision would make it difficult to finalize a trade deal, potentially exposing Canadian goods to a 35% tariff if an agreement isn't reached by an August 1 deadline. This development intensifies trade tensions between the two nations, linking geopolitical diplomacy directly to economic negotiations. The UK and France have also signaled their intent to recognize a Palestinian state. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli settler suspected of killing a Palestinian activist was previously sanctioned by the Biden administration, but those sanctions were lifted by the Trump administration. Yinon Levi, the alleged shooter, had been sanctioned for violence against Palestinian civilians, a measure he denied. After taking office, President Trump's executive order removed Levi from the U.S. sanctions list. The victim, Awdah Hathaleen, was an activist featured in the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," and his death has prompted calls from U.S. Democrats to hold violent settlers accountable.</p>

          <p>Qatar has threatened to stop liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries to Europe, including a key 2022 deal with Germany, over a new EU directive on corporate accountability. The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) requires companies to address human rights and environmental issues in their supply chains, with significant fines for noncompliance. Qatar argues the rules are burdensome and conflict with its national energy strategy, potentially redirecting its LNG exports to more business-friendly Asian markets. This dispute puts Europe's energy security at risk as it relies on Qatari gas. (not investment advice)</p>

The truce, which followed five days of deadly border clashes that killed 43 people, appears to be holding despite the incident. Thai officials state the soldiers surrendered and are being investigated before their release, while Cambodia claims one of its soldiers died in Thai custody. The conflict stems from a long-standing border dispute over ancient temples, with the recent ceasefire brokered after U.S. President Trump threatened both nations with tariffs.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump has effectively triumphed over the liberal media, which the author claims tried to destroy his presidency. The piece cites the defunding of NPR and PBS, the departure of host Stephen Colbert, and staff buyouts at The Washington Post as evidence of Trump's success. It also credits his administration with a strong economy and decisive foreign policy, including forcing a beneficial trade deal with the EU. The author concludes that Trump's willingness to fight back against media claims, such as those of sexual assault, has led to a significant shift in the media landscape.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington is set to hear arguments challenging the legality of President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs, which could derail the policy before it takes effect. The lawsuit, led by several states and small businesses, argues that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs without congressional approval. This legal challenge also targets fentanyl-related tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. The outcome of the case could significantly impact Washington's leverage in ongoing and future trade negotiations with key partners.</p>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency distributing over $12 billion annually to vital community health programs, has been severely impacted by Trump administration staffing purges.

Former agency leaders and health advocates express grave concern that the cuts could lead to the elimination of programs and weaken the nation's health safety net, with some funding for disadvantaged students already being canceled.</p>

          <p>Christian refugees and asylum seekers, particularly from Iran and Afghanistan, are facing significant hurdles due to the Trump administration's revised immigration policies. Despite fleeing religious persecution, many who entered the U.S. under previous programs now face detention and deportation orders. Advocates note this is a shift from the administration's first term, which was more supportive of some Christian refugees. While the White House maintains its commitment to protecting persecuted Christians, the overhaul of asylum systems and the end of temporary protections have left many families in a state of fear and uncertainty.</p>

Despite the falling volumes, the Budweiser maker managed to exceed profit expectations, with operating profit rising 6.5% and revenues increasing 3% to $15 billion.

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have finalized a trade agreement that includes US assistance in developing Pakistan's substantial oil reserves. President Donald Trump announced the deal, which he said will involve choosing a U.S. oil company to lead the partnership. In return, Pakistan confirmed it will receive lower tariffs on its exports to the U.S., avoiding a potential 29% levy. The announcement came shortly after Washington imposed a 25% tariff on India, with Trump criticizing India's own high tariffs and its trade with Russia, suggesting Pakistan might one day sell oil to its regional rival.

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned comments made by Spain's transport minister, Oscar Puente, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers as "Israeli kids" after they were removed from a flight. In a now-deleted social media post, Puente accused the Spanish right-wing of siding with the teens over the airline. French ministers called the statement unacceptable and discriminatory, also criticizing the use of force by Spanish police against a trip counselor. The incident involved 44 teenagers removed from a Vueling flight, with the airline alleging they posed a safety risk, a claim disputed by the trip's organizer.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent trade deal between the European Union and the United States is the EU's "Suez moment," a humiliating admission of its diminished geopolitical power. The author contends that the one-sided agreement, in which the EU made all major concessions on tariffs, investments, and energy purchases, shows its subservience to Washington. The piece contrasts the EU's capitulation with China's robust retaliation to US tariff threats, which forced the Trump administration to back down. The author concludes the deal exposes the EU's economic and security dependence on the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are expressing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. According to Malaysia's transport minister, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery backlogs from the two dominant manufacturers, is driving this interest. China is actively promoting its Comac-built C919 narrowbody airliner as a more readily available and cheaper option. This shift indicates a potential opening for China to gain a foothold in the highly competitive global aviation market.</p>

          <p>Australia's plan to ban social media for users under 16, pitched as a solution to a youth mental health crisis, is facing scrutiny from some experts. While the policy has strong public support, academics like Professor Marilyn Campbell argue there is no proven causal link between social media use and poor mental health, suggesting other factors like social inequity and climate anxiety are also at play. Critics also note that a ban could push young people to less safe corners of the internet and deprive them of beneficial online communities. The technical challenge of enforcing the age ban without compromising data privacy also remains a significant hurdle.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's August 1 tariff deadline nears, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the status of U.S. trade negotiations worldwide. The administration has secured eight framework deals, including with the EU, UK, and Japan, which generally set baseline tariffs of 10-20% but often involve significant concessions from the trading partners. Meanwhile, several key partners like Canada, Mexico, India, and Brazil face the threat of much higher tariffs amid stalled or contentious talks rooted in both economic and political disputes. The situation remains fluid, with a pending court case challenging the legality of the president's authority to impose these tariffs unilaterally. (not investment advice)</p>
