          <p>Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump engaged in productive negotiations regarding a UK-US economic deal.  Downing Street reported that these negotiations will continue.  The call follows threats of retaliation against US tariffs on British goods, particularly a looming 25% tax on car imports. This highlights the ongoing trade tensions between the two nations and the potential for significant economic impact.  The BBC's reporting may subtly favor a narrative of British resilience in the face of US trade pressure.</p>
