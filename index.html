          <p>The traditional midlife crisis, often associated with drastic changes and material pursuits, doesn't quite resonate with millennials entering their 40s. This generation, shaped by economic instability and a focus on mental health, seeks opportunities for personal growth and reevaluation rather than abandoning their lives. For many, the stability sought by previous generations remains elusive, leading to a sense of uncertainty and longing for security. The article explores how factors like economic recessions and evolving lifestyles contribute to a unique millennial midlife experience, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and adaptability in navigating this transition, as well as the importance of looking at midlife as an opportunity rather than a 'crisis'.</p>

World Boxing was granted provisional recognition as the sport's international governing federation by the IOC in February 2025.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has lowered its growth forecast for the UK economy, citing US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt as contributing factors. The OECD reduced its expectation for UK growth this year to 1.3% from 1.4% predicted in March, also cutting global forecasts due to trade tensions. The organization highlighted the UK's limited buffer in public finances and urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to increase tax revenue and reduce spending. While acknowledging better-than-expected UK economic growth between January and March, the OECD cautioned that momentum is weakening due to deteriorating business sentiment.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has filed a lawsuit against Alina Habba, interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, accusing her of malicious prosecution following his arrest outside an ICE detention facility.

Baraka claims he was unlawfully taken into custody and kept in custody for over five hours before appearing before a judge. Habba's office had moved to dismiss the case against Baraka after a federal judge admonished prosecutors for rushing the charges, which appeared to be politically motivated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals burdened by personal loan debt, understanding how to qualify for debt forgiveness is essential. Although complete forgiveness is rare, debt settlement, involving the lender accepting less than the full amount owed, offers a viable path. To qualify, borrowers typically need to be behind on payments, demonstrate financial hardship, and be prepared to offer a lump-sum payment. Alternatives such as debt management plans, refinancing, and consistent communication with lenders can also provide relief, especially for those ineligible for forgiveness (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Meta has signed a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase nuclear power, starting in June 2027, which will involve buying approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. This commitment from Meta prevented the plant from potentially closing upon the expiration of its zero-emissions credit. The power agreement indicates the growing power needs of AI data centers, and this development has positively impacted companies like GE Vernova and Eaton, which benefit from this trend. GE Vernova is experiencing a significant upward trend, and despite the consideration of trimming the position, the overall position size is deemed too small for such action (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Netherlands is set for a new election after Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) withdrew from the ruling coalition due to disagreements over immigration policy. Prime Minister Dick Schoof will lead a caretaker government until the election, with Wilders citing a lack of action on proposals to curb immigration as the reason for his party's departure. Coalition partners criticized Wilders for his lack of seriousness and for causing instability during a time of national and international challenges.

While bismuth subsalicylate is approved for treating diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and upset stomach, the study suggests it may not be beneficial for preventing diarrhea among international travelers.
