            <p>The Minnesota Timberwolves decisively defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 1 of their playoff series, winning 117-95. Despite a strong start from Luka Doncic, the Lakers struggled to match Minnesota's energy and offensive pressure, particularly when Doncic was off the court. The Timberwolves capitalized on fast breaks and second-chance points, showcasing the strength of their supporting players, while the Lakers' key players like Austin Reaves and LeBron James faced difficulties, leading to a significant shift in momentum and ultimately a comfortable victory for Minnesota.
