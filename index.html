          <p>Erin Patterson was found guilty of murdering three in-laws and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them beef Wellingtons containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The verdict followed a nine-week trial that captivated Australia, with the jury rejecting her defense that the poisoning was an accident. Prosecutors highlighted strained family relationships as a potential motive, though Patterson’s lawyers argued she had no reason to commit the crimes. The case hinged on whether she intentionally added the lethal fungi to the meal.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a potential additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This threat came as the bloc of developing nations, including powers like China and Russia, met and criticized unilateral protectionist measures. The BRICS joint statement voiced concerns over trade-distorting tariffs, while Trump’s announcement on social media specified there would be no exceptions to this new policy. The move signals a continued aggressive trade stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) has emerged as one of Africa's deadliest and most expansive jihadist groups, fueling instability across the Sahel region. Formed in 2017 in Mali, the group has since expanded its operations into Burkina Faso and Niger, exploiting local grievances and weak governance to recruit thousands of fighters. This article details how JNIM funds its activities through cattle-rustling and taxation, and how counterinsurgency efforts by local and international forces have so far failed to contain its growing threat.</p>

          <p>The scene at Camp Mystic in Texas reveals the horrific aftermath of a flash flood that swept through the Christian girls' camp, leaving a trail of devastation. Once a place of summer adventure, the site is now filled with mud-caked, toppled bunk beds and destroyed belongings scattered among the cabins. The deluge, which occurred with little warning, claimed the lives of the camp's director and several young campers, with more still missing. Survivors described terrifying scenes as they were evacuated from the camp, which now "didn't look like Camp Mystic anymore."</p>

          <p>The latest round of indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, has concluded its first session without achieving a breakthrough. While messages were exchanged, significant gaps reportedly remain between the two sides' positions. Hamas is still insisting on a guaranteed end to the war, a condition Israel has previously rejected. The talks are expected to resume as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travels to Washington to meet with President Trump to discuss the conflict.</p>

          <p>Two people were rescued from their SUV by courageous bystanders just minutes before the vehicle caused a major explosion at a Domino's restaurant in Herriman, Utah. The vehicle had crashed into the building and ruptured a gas line, leading to the blast which was caught on video. The explosion completely destroyed the Domino's and significantly damaged adjacent businesses. No one was inside the building at the time of the crash, and no one was injured by the explosion itself, though several people from the initial car accident were hospitalized.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are gaining ground on the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year, having achieved 30% containment. The blaze has burned over 80,000 acres in a rural area near the Carrizo Plain National Monument, threatening about 50 structures and forcing over 200 people to evacuate. Favorable weather and an influx of nearly 1,400 personnel have bolstered the fight, though officials remain cautious as a heat wave is expected to arrive midweek, potentially creating more challenging conditions.</p>
