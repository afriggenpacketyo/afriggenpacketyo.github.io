          <p>China's chip and AI-related stocks have recently experienced a significant rally, propelled by the nation's strategic push for technological self-sufficiency and efforts to reduce reliance on foreign processors like Nvidia. This rapid ascent has led to soaring valuations, prompting some investors to express caution. They worry that the current high multiples leave little margin for error, potentially testing market patience if these companies fail to deliver robust performance. This dynamic underscores a critical juncture where national industrial policy intersects with investor sentiment, requiring careful navigation to maintain growth momentum. The article points to a potential cooling of enthusiasm if concrete results do not materialize soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a Virginia grand jury on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges she misrepresented the intended use of a Norfolk, Virginia, property to secure a more favorable mortgage, saving her nearly $19,000. James has labeled the charges as "baseless" and a "continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system," linking them to her prior legal actions against Donald Trump.

Distinctive features include a long, sword-like snout and a unique prong-like bone near its nostril. Scientists also observed signs of severe injury or disease, and marks on its skull suggest it was likely killed by a larger predatory ichthyosaur.

          <p>The Los Angeles Fire Department is under criticism for its failure to deploy thermal imaging technology to detect lingering embers after a New Year's Day fire in Pacific Palisades. This omission allowed the initial blaze to rekindle days later, escalating into the devastating Palisades fire, which tragically claimed 12 lives and destroyed thousands of acres. Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva defended the decision, citing the depth of chaparral, but fire experts condemned the lack of thermal imaging as a critical misstep.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, in which the rapper accused the company of endangering his life by releasing and promoting Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us."
