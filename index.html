          <p>Australians are heading to the polls to elect their next government amidst economic challenges and geopolitical tensions. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, overshadowing global issues stemming from Washington. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party is seeking a second term, while Peter Dutton leads the opposition coalition, with both offering modest economic solutions. The New York Times article notes that voters are increasingly shifting away from major parties, favoring independent candidates and minor parties, indicating a desire for deeper solutions to the country's problems.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar due to increased capital inflow. This action, the first in two years, involved the purchase of US dollars and the sale of Hong Kong dollars to maintain the currency's trading band. The intervention precedes a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further stimulate capital inflow into Hong Kong. The HKMA stated it will continue to monitor the market to ensure orderly operations in Hong Kong's money and foreign exchange markets.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders over their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit argues that these policies obstruct federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, citing concerns about a Venezuelan gang's alleged control of an apartment complex in Aurora. The suit seeks to invalidate state and city laws that prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, claiming they violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Local officials have responded, defending their policies and vowing to fight the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Federal officials are investigating an incident where an Army helicopter entered restricted airspace near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, causing two commercial flights to abort their landings. The helicopter, a Black Hawk headed to the Pentagon, prompted air traffic controllers to intervene. The event has raised concerns among officials and lawmakers, especially following a fatal collision in January that led to stricter helicopter traffic rules around the airport. Senator Ted Cruz has called for legislation to improve civilian air safety, according to The New York Times.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering an executive order regarding Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) payments to college athletes after meeting with former Alabama coach Nick Saban. Saban reportedly complained about NIL and its impact on college sports. The Yahoo Sports article highlights that an executive order could potentially upend years of legal battles involving the NCAA and various levels of government, and would be an attempt to subvert the authority of the courts.</p>

          <p>The number of people diagnosed with autism is increasing, but the reasons behind this rise are complex. The BBC article explores the changes in diagnostic criteria, the recognition of autism in women and girls, and the growing number of adults being diagnosed. While there is a clear increase in diagnoses, it's not necessarily a rise in the number of autistic people, but rather a better understanding and broader definition of autism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to significantly reorganize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and cut staffing to levels similar to those during the Reagan administration. NPR reports that this could mean thousands fewer employees, particularly in the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The agency's plans to move scientific staff and cut the ORD budget have raised concerns about the future of environmental research and the ability to protect human health.</p>
