          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to federal fraud charges. Santos, who had previously been expelled from Congress due to a multitude of fabrications about his personal and professional life, must also pay significant restitution. He admitted to engaging in campaign finance schemes, fraudulently claiming unemployment benefits during the pandemic, and making false statements on House financial disclosure forms. The sentencing marks the end of a tumultuous period for Santos, whose lies brought him both notoriety and ultimately, a prison sentence. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters believe President Trump is overreaching with his aggressive expansion of executive power. The poll indicates that many voters view the early months of Trump's administration as chaotic and scary, even among those who approve of his job performance. Voters also express declining confidence in Trump's handling of key issues like the economy and immigration. His approval rating stands at 42%, which is historically low for a president at this stage in his term, reflecting his persistent unpopularity. Optimism score: 60</p>
