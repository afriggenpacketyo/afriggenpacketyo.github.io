          <p>A tragic mass shooting occurred late Wednesday outside a downtown Chicago nightclub, leaving four people dead and fourteen wounded. The violence erupted from a drive-by vehicle as people were exiting the Artis Lounge in the River North area following a rapper's album release party. This event marks a grim repeat of violence for the location, which was the site of a fatal mass shooting in November 2022 when it operated as the Hush Lounge, leading to a temporary police shutdown. Authorities are now conducting a large-scale search for the suspects who fled in the vehicle, as the community grapples with another major incident of gun violence in a familiar public space.</p>

Harding, who positions himself as a husband, father, and businessman, launched his bid with a message focused on bringing Heartland values to Washington D.C. He received an endorsement from U.S. Senator Deb Fischer and praised the outgoing Rep. Bacon for his decade of service and integrity. Bacon, a moderate Republican known for his staunch support of U.S. aid to Ukraine, will complete his current term before retiring from Congress.</p>

          <p>An official report from a UK watchdog found that historical child grooming investigations by Greater Manchester Police were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence from Manchester City Council. The inspectorate noted some documents were so obscured that assessing their evidential value was impossible, specifically impacting major inquiries like Operation Green Jacket and Operation Bernese. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing laws and the risk of jeopardizing prosecutions. Since the findings, the police, council, and Crown Prosecution Service have established new, more efficient protocols for sharing unredacted information, though past failings have eroded public trust.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged and tense overnight session, the House narrowly voted to advance President Trump's signature tax and spending bill, following hours of delays as GOP leaders worked to sway holdouts. The procedural vote, which began Wednesday evening and concluded early Thursday morning, was a significant test for Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership amid resistance from both moderate and conservative Republicans over changes made by the Senate. President Trump was reportedly actively involved, making calls to undecided members to secure their support for the legislation. The bill, which extends tax cuts and boosts spending on defense and border security, now moves to a final debate and vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent actions, including a major domestic spending bill and a military strike on Iran, have clarified his political identity as a continuation of, rather than a break from, past American policies. Despite populist rhetoric, his massive tax cuts for the rich and social spending cuts represent a doubling down on neoliberalism. Similarly, the aggressive military action against Iran revives a neoconservative foreign policy, disappointing supporters who hoped for restraint. The author contends that instead of ushering in a new era, Trump has ultimately reinforced the long-standing, and often criticized, political consensus of the last half-century, blocking any real exit from these dominant ideologies.</p>

          <p>Madonna "Donna" Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, was arrested by ICE agents from her front yard in New Orleans. Her family, who was unaware of the arrest until a neighbor notified them, is now desperately seeking her release from a Louisiana detention center. Kashanian, who has no criminal record and was a dedicated community volunteer, had a long-standing stay of removal that required regular check-ins. Her detention comes amid a nationwide ICE crackdown and has left her family struggling to find legal help in an overwhelmed system, highlighting the human cost of current immigration policies on long-term residents and their communities.</p>

          <p>Following his surprising Democratic primary win for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani's platform has been labeled as radical, but this analysis argues his key policies are more tested than extreme. Proposals like a rent freeze on stabilized apartments, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses have been implemented in various forms elsewhere with some success. For instance, rent freezes occurred three times under a previous NYC mayor, and publicly owned stores operate in several states. The article suggests that Mamdani's agenda is less about a sweeping ideological overhaul and more about using government to tangibly improve quality of life, a message that resonated strongly with voters seeking effective governance.</p>

Both leaders commented on the camp's remote, swampy location as a natural deterrent to escape. The tour occurred as immigrant advocates filed a court document detailing allegations of mistreatment and poor conditions in an ICE facility in Los Angeles, illustrating the nationwide scope and controversial nature of the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies, which often prioritize cruelty as a tactic.</p>

The lawsuit alleged that "60 Minutes" unfairly edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. While there is internal frustration over the payment, some relief exists within the news division that the settlement did not include a public apology, which was seen as a critical line not to cross. The situation leaves the prestigious news program to navigate an era of heightened media mistrust while its parent company undergoes a major corporate transition.</p>

          <p>A significant and growing ideological gap between young men and women is reshaping politics globally, with South Korea serving as a prime example. In recent elections, a large majority of South Korean men in their 20s and 30s voted for conservative candidates, a stark contrast to their female counterparts. Experts suggest this phenomenon is driven by socioeconomic anxieties, a hypercompetitive job market, and a backlash against feminism, which many young men perceive as unfairly blaming them for societal issues. This political polarization is challenging traditional party lines, with many young male voters feeling disenfranchised by both the establishment and a system they believe favors women and older generations.</p>

This lapse occurred during a period when workers at one landfill were not wearing respiratory protection.

For the Santa Rosa Rancheria Tachi Yokut Tribe, restoring the lake, known as Paâ€™ashi, holds deep cultural and spiritual importance.

These incidents, where plainclothes ICE agents in unmarked vehicles detain individuals, have created widespread fear and confusion, leading to criticism of the LAPD's role. When officers respond, their protocol is often to perform crowd control rather than interfere with the federal agents, a stance that has drawn fire from activists and city leaders who argue it appears to be supporting ICE. In response, the LAPD has created new guidelines requiring supervisors to respond and verify agents' identities, but maintains it lacks authority to halt federal operations.</p>

          <p>A new musical subgenre, dubbed "toddler techno," is gaining popularity, with DJ Lenny Pearce hosting sold-out "baby raves" for children and their parents across the U.S. These events feature remixes of classic children's songs like "The Wheels on the Bus" with heavy electronic dance beats, creating an experience that bridges generational tastes. While some critics question the association with rave culture, many parents find the music more tolerable than traditional kids' songs, and experts note it can promote family bonding and joy. The events are carefully managed, with controlled sound levels and advice for parents on preventing overstimulation, reflecting a growing trend of adapting adult cultural experiences for a family-friendly audience.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the modern American road trip, questioning whether its spirit of discovery has been diminished by technology and political polarization. The author, a professor who teaches a course on the topic, describes a personal cross-country journey where the experience felt insulated and predictable, a stark contrast to the literary adventures of Kerouac or Steinbeck. However, a stop in the small town of Shamrock, Texas, on the Fourth of July restores his faith. The warmth of an immigrant family running a motel and the shared, simple moment of watching fireworks with diverse travelers provided a profound reminder of shared humanity and the enduring, hopeful promise of the open road.</p>

          <p>This BBC Verify article examines three key claims surrounding President Trump's controversial "big beautiful bill." Regarding its cost, independent analyses, including from the Congressional Budget Office, contradict White House claims of deficit reduction, projecting it will add over $3 trillion to the national debt over ten years. On healthcare, despite Trump's assurances, studies show the bill would make significant cuts to Medicaid, with the Kaiser Family Foundation estimating a $1 trillion reduction over a decade, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. Finally, the article scrutinizes the president's claim that failing to pass the bill would cause a 68% tax hike, noting the White House did not provide a calculation for this specific figure.

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska voiced his support for President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill, urging fellow party members to pass it despite his own reservations about Senate-led changes to Medicaid. In an interview, Bacon argued that voting against the bill would effectively be a vote to raise taxes on middle-class families by about 20 percent. He defended the bill's Medicaid reforms as being focused on implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults. His comments come as House Speaker Mike Johnson struggles to secure enough votes from a divided GOP caucus, with moderates worried about insurance losses and conservatives concerned about the national debt.

          <h2>Newark Airport Shows Signs of Recovery After Months of Operational Struggles</h2>

          <p>After a difficult spring marked by widespread flight delays and cancellations, Newark Liberty International Airport is showing signs of improved performance. The earlier problems, caused by runway construction and air traffic control outages, led to a 20% drop in passenger traffic in May. However, recent data indicates a significant turnaround, with Newark having fewer cancellations and better on-time departure rates than other New York City airports in June. This improvement is attributed to the completion of runway work and better equipment functionality. While many travelers remain wary from past experiences, the positive trend offers hope for a smoother travel season, though afternoon thunderstorms can still pose a challenge.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to deliver a speech in Iowa to kick off a year of "America250" events celebrating the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. The event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds is expected to feature proposals like a "Great American State Fair" and a revival of his call for a National Garden of American Heroes. The speech will also serve as a platform for Trump to promote his second-term policy agenda, including his sweeping tax and spending bill currently being debated in the House. He is also expected to address his trade policies, particularly as they affect farmers, a key part of his political base who have been impacted by his tariff strategies.</p>

          <p>Hip-hop mogul Sean Combs received a mixed verdict in his federal trial, being found not guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking but guilty of two lesser charges of transporting for prostitution. While a legal win, the trial has permanently damaged his public image and business empire, with numerous brands severing ties and his reputation tainted by disturbing allegations and video evidence of physical abuse. The prosecution's case, which centered on Combs coercing ex-girlfriends into illegal sex acts, failed to prove a broader criminal enterprise. The verdict leaves Combs' future in a nebulous state; he still faces prison time and dozens of civil lawsuits, but the acquittal on major charges may open a path for an eventual comeback.</p>

          <h2>Understanding and Managing Blood Sugar 'Dips' for Better Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 05:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores the concept of being a glucose "dipper," where blood sugar crashes below baseline levels a few hours after eating carbohydrates, leading to fatigue, mood swings, and increased hunger. Research shows these dips can cause people to consume hundreds of extra calories throughout the day, potentially hindering weight loss. Experts suggest that individuals can manage these fluctuations without a continuous glucose monitor by paying attention to how they feel after meals. To stabilize blood sugar, nutritionists recommend "clothing" carbs by pairing them with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day, and eating the protein and fiber components of a meal first.</p>

          <h2>Republican Governors Remain Silent on Major Medicaid Cuts in Trump's Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Congress moves to pass President Trump's legislative package containing roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, Republican governors have been notably silent, a stark contrast to their vocal opposition to similar cuts in 2017. The bill imposes new work requirements and paperwork demands that would primarily affect the 19 red states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, creating large holes in their budgets. Despite the significant financial and healthcare impact on their states, most GOP governors have not publicly commented, a silence that provides political cover for lawmakers supporting the cuts and reflects a shift in the party's internal dynamics and fear of drawing Trump's ire.
