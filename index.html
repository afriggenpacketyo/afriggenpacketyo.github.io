          <p>The city manager of Glendale, California, has decided to terminate a contract with the Department of Homeland Security that allowed the Glendale Police Department to house immigration detainees at its facility. The decision comes amid ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, although the press release from the city does not explicitly mention them. The city acknowledges that the contract had become divisive, despite efforts to maintain transparency and safeguards. The termination is attributed to the city's commitment to public safety, local accountability, and trust, rather than political motivations, as the contract became too divisive for the city's comfort.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million complaint against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds. Baldoni claimed Lively falsely accused him of sexual harassment in an attempt to repair her reputation following the fallout around the "It Ends With Us" press tour. The judge stated that Baldoni's legal team did not sufficiently allege that Lively, Reynolds, or their publicist acted with serious doubt about the truth of their statements, which is required for defamation claims. The court found that the claims against Lively were privileged and that the other allegations lacked the necessary elements for a defamation case, leading to the dismissal of the amended complaint in its entirety.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 22 years for attempting to murder a colleague. Brooks broke into Graeme Perks's home in Nottinghamshire in January 2021, armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, intending to set the house on fire and harm Mr. Perks. The attack was motivated by disciplinary proceedings against Brooks, in which Mr. Perks was a witness, and the judge noted that Brooks blamed Mr. Perks for his professional difficulties. The case was marked by numerous delays and attempts by Brooks to obstruct the proceedings.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced plans to sue President Donald Trump over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. Newsom argues that Trump's actions are illegal and represent an overreach of federal power, stating that the order could allow the President to deploy the National Guard in any state. The lawsuit comes amid heightened tensions between California and the Trump administration over immigration enforcement and federal intervention.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is considering a federal tax boycott in response to potential funding cuts from the Trump administration for the state's university system.

          <p>Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set ablaze in downtown Los Angeles during protests against President Trump's immigration policies. Five vehicles were vandalized and could not be retrieved, leading Waymo to suspend service in the affected area. The protests erupted following Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the city, with tensions escalating between protesters and law enforcement. Photos show Waymo vehicles engulfed in flames with anti-ICE graffiti, and some individuals were seen throwing Lime e-scooters into the burning cars.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has announced a new initiative requiring all students to become fluent in artificial intelligence (AI), integrating AI education throughout the undergraduate curriculum. The program aims to prepare students to lead in a workforce increasingly shaped by AI. Students will learn to combine their major field of study with the application of AI, becoming "bilingual" in their respective areas. While students will be encouraged to use AI tools, they will not be permitted to pass off AI-generated content as their own work, and faculty will receive guidance on maintaining academic integrity.</p>

          <p>Shares of Robinhood experienced a decline of over 5% after the online brokerage was not selected for inclusion in the S&P 500 during the latest quarterly rebalance.

Bank of America had previously identified Robinhood as a top candidate for inclusion, which typically results in increased trading volume and passive fund investments. Despite this setback, Robinhood's stock has seen a significant comeback this year, rising nearly 90% amid a rebound in both stocks and crypto.</p>
