          <h2>Review Highlights Need for Stronger Regulation in England and Wales Water Sector</h2>

          <p>An independent Water Commission review has revealed that the water sector in England and Wales is underperforming, citing issues such as pollution, financial mismanagement, and infrastructure failures that have eroded public trust. The review, initiated by the government in response to growing concerns about sewage spills and rising bills, emphasizes the necessity for stronger regulatory measures to safeguard both billpayers and the environment. While the government has ruled out nationalizing the sector due to cost concerns, the review's interim findings underscore the urgency of addressing these systemic problems to restore confidence in the water industry. The findings suggest the need for robust oversight and enforcement to ensure the sector operates responsibly and sustainably.</p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89 due to pneumonia.

His on-field exploits and charismatic personality made him a national icon, fondly remembered by many as a symbol of that era.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a disastrous February bar exam plagued by technical problems, the State Bar of California has approved new scoring adjustments, resulting in more than 200 test-takers moving from "fail" to "pass." The grading change, which affects applicants who nearly passed and received a second read on their written questions, raises the overall pass rate from 56% to 63%. These adjustments are part of a series of remedies aimed at mitigating the impact of the flawed exam on applicants' legal careers, including a lower raw passing score and "imputed" scores for those who couldn't complete significant portions of the test. While some Bar trustees have expressed concerns about the higher pass rate, the Bar maintains its commitment to protecting the public from unqualified lawyers while finding fair solutions.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to enhance its military capabilities with new nuclear-powered attack submarines and increased readiness for European warfare, as announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This defense boost, the most significant since the Soviet Union's collapse, aims to address the growing threat posed by Russia and send a message to the United States regarding Europe's commitment to its own defense. The strategic defense review includes increased weapons production, cyber command establishment, and investment in drone technology, reflecting lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine. While the government aims to increase defense spending to 3% of national income, the plan's financial feasibility remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda has indicated that the central bank will not aggressively pursue policy rate hikes unless economic and price conditions improve, citing significant uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. Ueda emphasized that the BOJ will not raise rates simply to create room for future easing, but will continue to lift rates if the economy and prices align with expectations. This cautious approach reflects concerns that trade frictions stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could negatively impact the global economy and domestic companies. The BOJ's stance underscores the challenges of navigating monetary policy amid global trade tensions.</p>
