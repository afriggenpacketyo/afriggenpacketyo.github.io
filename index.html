          <p>Representatives from Iran and the United States are set to resume high-level talks in Oman to address disputes over Tehran's nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the discussions, both expressing hopes for a decisive breakthrough while acknowledging significant red lines. The US insists on halting uranium enrichment, while Iran defends its right to enrich for civilian purposes, creating a deadlock that both sides aim to resolve diplomatically to avert potential military action. Trump has indicated a preference for a diplomatic solution but has also threatened military action if necessary.</p>

          <p>Former workers at the Department of Health and Human Services are warning that mass terminations and budget cuts are undermining critical programs, potentially leading to missed disease outbreaks. The cuts, driven by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency", have resulted in staff layoffs at both federal and state levels, impacting disease surveillance and response capabilities. The article highlights concerns about the dismantling of the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), with the termination of federal experts on HIV prevention in children overseas. Additionally, reductions in the Administration for Children and Families are increasing workloads and potentially jeopardizing child support services, further destabilizing vulnerable families.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has released its annual report, naming Wichita, Kansas, as the top allergy capital for the third consecutive year. The report considers tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and allergist availability. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, paying attention to timing by staying indoors during high pollen count times, and seeking care if symptoms persist or worsen. The article notes that allergy symptoms can mimic those of colds and viruses, emphasizing the importance of consulting a doctor for proper diagnosis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles have experienced a significant surge. In the first quarter of this year, plug-in hybrid exports rose nearly 600%, with March alone showing an increase of 1,849% year-on-year. The UK has become a key destination for Chinese EVs, second only to the EU, due to a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the higher tariffs imposed by the EU. One Londoner cited affordability as the reason for choosing a Chinese MG electric vehicle over a Tesla.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco's first-quarter net profit fell by 5% year-on-year, reaching $26 billion, due to lower oil prices and production. The company's free cash flow also decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, signaling financial strain amidst global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty affecting energy markets. Aramco reduced its performance-linked dividend payout to $200 million, impacting revenue for the Saudi government, which faces widening deficits and mounting debt. The article notes that OPEC+ has increased production targets despite anticipated supply gluts and weak demand, leading to downgraded oil price outlooks from banks and energy agencies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about imminent progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, stating his commitment to working with both sides to end the conflict. This follows Putin's announcement of a unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine reported was violated by Russian forces. Zelenskyy proposed a 30-day ceasefire and, after discussions with European leaders in Kyiv, indicated that a complete and unconditional ceasefire should begin soon. Putin has offered direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, to which Zelenskyy responded as "a positive sign", signaling potential de-escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues against the pressure on mothers to be perfect, highlighting that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance. She suggests that mothers often receive messages implying they are not doing enough, partly stemming from historical biases within psychiatry that unfairly blamed mothers for their children's problems. Ross encourages mothers to admit imperfections and offers a quiz to demonstrate that being imperfect is normal and acceptable. Ultimately, she advocates for giving mothers slack and recognizing that being "good enough" is indeed enough.</p>

Texts revealed Ryan providing her with drugs like ketamine and propofol, even injecting her while she slept, creating a chemical dependency.

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remains steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year, influenced by factors such as global demand for Treasury bonds and Federal Reserve policy decisions. Rates for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Recent fluctuations in mortgage rates mirror the volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use to price mortgage loans. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish spring home-buying season as sales of previously occupied homes decline.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts University, has returned to Boston after being released from an immigration detention center in Louisiana. Ozturk, who was detained for over six weeks after co-authoring an op-ed criticizing Tufts' response to the Gaza conflict, stated she lost her freedom and education during a crucial time in her studies. She intends to continue her legal battle, asserting faith in the American justice system. Her lawyers argue that her detention was unlawful, designed to punish her for exercising her First Amendment rights, and aimed at deterring others from speaking out.</p>

          <p>The newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's appointment of several individuals from the business sector to top cabinet positions has sparked concerns over potential conflicts of interest. Critics point to the lack of political experience among appointees and the potential for undue influence from their former industries. While lobbying is regulated in Germany through the Lobby Register, experts argue that existing rules are insufficient to curtail conflicts of interest effectively. The article highlights the need for greater transparency and stricter regulations to prevent undue influence from business interests on political decision-making.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to USAID are severely impacting healthcare in Africa, with HIV patients losing access to medication and healthcare programs halting. Sub-Saharan Africa, a major recipient of USAID funding, faces the potential loss of millions of lives due to treatable diseases. Amref Health Africa has lost a significant portion of its budget, leading to canceled educational programs and reduced tuberculosis screenings. Experts warn of a resurgence in malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV, undoing years of progress in disease prevention.

          <p>Chinese energy investments in Africa are increasingly directed towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends as China moves away from funding new coal-fired power plants overseas.
