          <p>Private members' club chain Soho House has been acquired for $2.7 billion (£2 billion) by a consortium that includes Hollywood actor and investor Ashton Kutcher. The group, which started in London in 1995 and now boasts 46 locations globally, has faced challenges with profitability and a perceived loss of exclusivity since its 2021 New York Stock Exchange listing. The deal, spearheaded by MCR Hotels and private equity firm Apollo, aims to return Soho House to private ownership, with Kutcher and MCR's CEO joining the board. This strategic move seeks to place the brand on a more stable financial footing and reignite its exclusive appeal, despite a challenging period for the broader hospitality and restaurant industry.</p>

          <p>Dean Smith, 51, and Stuart Williams, 36, have pleaded guilty to causing violent disorder during a protest outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which has been used to house asylum seekers. The incident on July 17 saw hundreds demonstrate, leading to the men being remanded in custody for sentencing in October. This unrest follows an earlier arrest of a hotel resident, Hadush Kebatu, who was charged with sexual assault, harassment, and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, charges which he denies. The broader situation has resulted in 28 arrests and 16 charges related to disorder at the hotel, highlighting ongoing tensions and legal consequences stemming from the protests.</p>

          <p>Former Disney star Bella Thorne, 27, has sparked widespread social media debate after sharing footage of herself proposing to her fiancé, Mark Emms, two years after he initially proposed to her. The non-traditional gesture, where Thorne got down on one knee, garnered a highly polarized reaction from her nearly 24 million followers. While some comments criticized the act as undermining traditional gender roles, others vehemently defended it as a powerful statement of equality and commitment within a relationship. Thorne acknowledged the "hilarious" and "totally split" comments, highlighting the ongoing public discussion surrounding modern relationship norms and individual choices.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has re-strengthened to a Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, and is projected to cause "life-threatening surf and rip currents" across the U.S. East Coast this week. Although the storm is not expected to make direct landfall in the U.S., its large size means coastal areas will experience dangerous conditions, including waves potentially exceeding 20 feet. Tropical storm warnings are already in effect for Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, and mandatory evacuations have been ordered for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks, emphasizing the significant risk posed by the powerful storm.</p>

          <p>The German Bundesliga is experiencing a notable decline in global appeal and a significant loss of top talent, increasingly lagging behind Europe's leading football leagues, the Premier League and La Liga. High-profile players like Florian Wirtz and Thomas Müller have departed, while the league's financial performance, including revenue from television rights and overall attendance, falls considerably short of the Premier League's figures. Former Bayern chairman Oliver Kahn has voiced alarm, stating the Bundesliga's supposed appeal is "deceptive" and that it struggles to compete sportingly, financially, and media-wise, raising concerns about its long-term standing in international football.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military junta has announced that the first phase of a general election will be held in late December, marking the country's first nationwide poll since the 2021 coup. The election, which is expected to span three separate days, is widely perceived by opponents as a strategic maneuver to legitimize the junta's rule amidst an ongoing and deadly civil war. With significant portions of the country under opposition control and Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy banned, analysts and many groups have vowed to boycott the vote, raising serious doubts about its credibility, fairness, and the logistical feasibility of holding it nationwide.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's Google and Kairos Power have announced a groundbreaking collaboration to deploy an advanced nuclear plant, Hermes 2, connected to the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) electric grid by 2030. This initiative marks the first time a U.S. utility has signed a power purchase agreement with an advanced reactor, with Kairos and Google assuming the financial risk of the first-of-a-kind project. The 50-megawatt reactor aims to provide reliable, carbon-free power for Google's data centers in the region, offering a potential solution to the high costs and delays that have historically plagued large nuclear projects in the U.S. This partnership could pave the way for a new era of more affordable and scalable nuclear energy deployment.</p>

The Old Bailey heard that the shooting stemmed from a bitter feud between rival Turkish gangs, with whom Riley had links.

Additionally, comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding the strategic bitcoin reserve contributed to investor disappointment, leading to widespread pressure across the broader crypto market and related stocks.

          <p>Goldman Sachs economists are forecasting continued weakening in the U.S. job market, asserting that hiring momentum has decelerated more than previously believed, with trend job growth now too low to sustain full employment. This sobering assessment, which contrasts with the relatively stable unemployment rate, is supported by other indicators like declining labor force participation and falling job openings. The analysts suggest that this sustained softness in payrolls strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to implement interest rate cuts later this year.

This strategy advocates for a significant post-ceasefire military build-up, including long-range strike capabilities, to demonstrate to Moscow that further invasion would be futile and costly. The article suggests that the Trump administration may have misread Russian demands for territorial concessions and Ukrainian demilitarization, as Moscow shows no sign of abandoning its maximalist position.

          <p>Fair Isle, recognized as the UK's most remote inhabited island, situated halfway between Orkney and Shetland, is currently seeking a new permanent nurse to serve as its sole medical professional. The island's current nurse is set to depart later this month, prompting NHS Shetland to advertise the position as a "unique opportunity" to become an integral part of the close-knit community of approximately 50 residents. The role demands an experienced and confident clinician capable of managing diverse medical needs, supported by mainland doctors, in an environment where the Coastguard rescue helicopter serves as the primary ambulance. Residents emphasize the island's strong, sociable community and its appeal for those seeking a challenging yet rewarding lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is slated to testify before Congress in a closed-door deposition regarding his personal involvement in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein's death in federal custody.

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is seeking answers about the circumstances surrounding Epstein's 2019 death, which continues to fuel suspicions and conspiracy theories years later, prompting further governmental inquiry into the high-profile case.</p>

This volume of complaints marks the highest for the show in four years, with a significant number specifically targeting alleged bullying against one contestant. Ofcom concluded that the negative behavior depicted in the villa was not shown in a positive light and was consistent with viewer expectations for the established format of the reality show, which inherently tests relationships and friendships.

          <p>An in-depth analysis of the Premier League's opening weekend has highlighted significant defensive vulnerabilities in Liverpool's tactical approach under new manager Arne Slot, particularly their susceptibility to counter-attacks. The team notably conceded as many fast-break goals in their first game against Bournemouth as they did throughout the entire previous season, attributed to sloppy midfield passing and an aggressive commitment of players to attack. While the article acknowledges the potential for enhanced goal-scoring opportunities with improved execution of their direct style, it suggests that Slot may need to adjust the positions of full-backs or central midfielders to provide better defensive protection against rapid counter-attacking opponents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market is currently witnessing a new trend dubbed "job hugging," where workers are holding onto their existing positions "for dear life" due to prevailing economic uncertainty. This phenomenon marks a stark contrast to the previous "great resignation" period, as indicated by low rates of hires, quits, and layoffs, suggesting a significant stagnation in job movement. Experts caution that while remaining in a job isn't inherently negative, this lack of mobility can potentially hinder individual earnings growth and reduce marketability in the long run if workers do not actively seek new responsibilities or skills. The trend also makes it harder for new entrants to find work.</p>
