          <p>Volkswagen has revised its 2025 financial outlook downwards after reporting a 29% decrease in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The German automaker attributed the decline to a €1.5 billion impact from U.S. tariffs and €700 million in restructuring costs during the first half of the year. Consequently, the company now anticipates an operating return on sales between 4% and 5%, reduced from the previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%. Despite these challenges, the company saw strong order intake for electric vehicles in Europe, signaling some regional resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has become the first G7 nation to declare its intention to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, with President Emmanuel Macron aiming for a UN General Assembly decision in September. The move has drawn strong condemnation from Israel and the United States, who argue it legitimizes Hamas, while receiving praise from Spain, Ireland, Norway, and nations in the Middle East. Currently, 143 of 193 UN members support Palestinian statehood, but full membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council. This decision highlights a growing divide among Western powers regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the NHS faces a difficult period as resident doctors in England commence a five-day strike over pay. While the government aims to minimize disruption, over a million appointments and procedures have been canceled since walkouts began in March 2023. The British Medical Association (BMA) is demanding pay restoration to offset inflation since 2008, a request the government has refused to negotiate. The strike proceeds amid political criticism and concerns from NHS leaders about maintaining patient safety while attempting to keep non-urgent services running.</p>

          <p>The parents of Malki Roth, a 15-year-old American murdered in the 2001 Sbarro pizzeria bombing in Jerusalem, are intensifying pressure on the U.S. government to extradite the perpetrator from Jordan. They met with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, imploring her to enforce the 1995 extradition treaty with Jordan, where Hamas terrorist Ahlam al-Tamimi resides freely. Al-Tamimi, who is on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list, confessed to her role in the attack that killed 16 people. Despite a $5 million reward for her capture, Jordan has refused to extradite her, creating ongoing diplomatic tension with the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, for U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a procedural move that allows her to serve in an acting capacity. The decision follows a federal court's attempt to replace Habba with her deputy as her initial 120-day interim term was expiring, a move Attorney General Pam Bondi condemned as judicial overreach. By pulling the nomination, the administration sidesteps a law preventing nominees from serving in an acting role, highlighting a contentious struggle between the executive branch and the judiciary over key prosecutorial appointments and presidential authority.</p>

          <p>Recent polling indicates a decline in President Trump's approval ratings, particularly concerning his handling of the budget and immigration, with some supporters expressing frustration over the administration's stance on the Jeffrey Epstein files. However, this opinion article argues that such shifts in public opinion may not significantly threaten his hold on power. The author posits that authoritarian leaders often rely on intimidation, control of institutions, and suppressing dissent rather than popular support. The analysis suggests that while cracks may be appearing in the MAGA coalition, Trump's strategy of consolidating power and challenging democratic norms continues unabated.</p>

The GHF, which has a near-monopoly on aid delivery, has been criticized for creating a system where starving civilians must risk their lives for inadequate supplies.

          <p>In a UK first, Wales will introduce a debit-style card for individuals with conditions like coeliac disease to purchase gluten-free food. The new system provides an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The pre-loaded cards will offer more choice and flexibility, allowing users to shop at supermarkets and other stores. While the move is intended to de-medicalize the process and improve convenience, some participants in a pilot scheme noted that the monthly allowance only "scratches the surface" of the significantly higher cost of a gluten-free diet.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions are preparing to face Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with an opportunity to clinch the series 2-0. A victory would mark the first time the Lions have won the first two tests of a series in 28 years, a significant historical achievement. The Lions are considered strong favorites, especially after a dominant performance in the first 50 minutes of their previous match in Brisbane. Australia is under immense pressure to improve, but key players are returning from injury with little recent game time, raising questions about their readiness for the high-intensity match.</p>

          <p>A movement to eliminate artificial food dyes, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is gaining traction as the U.S. dairy industry pledges to remove them from ice cream by 2028. Kennedy and other advocates link these petroleum-based additives to health issues like hyperactivity in children, a concern that has led several states to enact their own bans or warning labels. While the transition to natural, plant-based dyes presents logistical and supply chain challenges for manufacturers, the broad support for the initiative suggests a major shift in America's food landscape, moving away from the vibrant, synthetic colors common for decades.</p>

          <p>PayZen, a company using AI to purchase medical debt from hospitals, argues its interest-free payment plans can help solve the healthcare affordability crisis. The company buys patient debt from hospitals at a discount and then collects the full amount from patients over time, a model that is gaining traction as hospitals face revenue drops from Republican-led healthcare cuts. While the CEO frames it as an affordability solution, consumer advocates raise concerns about a lack of transparency, questioning why patients aren't offered the same discounted rate. They also worry that low-income patients eligible for charity care might be improperly enrolled in these plans.</p>

          <p>The United States has experienced a historic drop in its murder rate over the past two years, with 2025 potentially on track for the lowest rate since the 1960s. An analysis points to a multi-faceted approach, including a massive influx of federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act which supported violence reduction groups and community infrastructure improvements in cities like Baltimore. However, this progress is now threatened, as the Justice Department has canceled nearly a billion dollars in grants for these programs. Experts warn that while it is difficult to predict crime trends, losing these resources could hamper efforts to combat violence if rates begin to rise again.</p>

          <p>An Argentine court has ordered Google to pay the equivalent of $12,500 in compensation to a man who was photographed naked in his yard by a Street View camera. The man, a policeman, argued that the image, which captured him from behind while he was within his property behind a tall wall, violated his dignity and exposed him to ridicule. An appeals court overturned a lower court's decision, ruling that there was a "blatant" and "arbitrary intrusion" into the man's private life.

          <p>As skin cancer cases rise globally, understanding how sunscreens work is crucial for public health. This article explains that sunscreens use either organic (carbon-based) molecules that absorb UV radiation or mineral filters like zinc and titanium oxide that physically block it. While all approved sunscreens are effective, concerns exist about some older chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, though the health risk at typical exposure levels is still being studied. Experts emphasize the importance of using any regulated sunscreen and warn against homemade or "natural" alternatives that offer negligible protection, highlighting the complexity of formulating a safe and effective product.</p>

          <p>To address a severe housing crisis exacerbated by last year's wildfire, the Maui County Council has advanced a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals. The legislation targets condos in apartment-zoned areas, requiring them to be rented for a minimum of 180 days, effectively converting them to long-term housing. Proponents, like the group Lahaina Strong, see this as a critical step to provide homes for local residents, predicting it will add over 6,000 units to the housing stock. Opponents worry about the economic impact on small businesses that service the rentals and question if locals can afford the converted units.</p>
