          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have introduced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amid trade concerns. These steps aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While analysts note that these measures may have limited impact on boosting domestic credit demand, they signal a greater urgency from officials to bolster the economy and ease depreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan. The article notes new fiscal policy measures are missing and may only be unleashed when policymakers see concrete signs of economic deterioration.</p>

This LA Times article notes that in the interest of having those arms available for the stretch of the season, many of them have been ‚Äúredlined‚Äù now, as Roberts termed it, to try and keep their inning counts under some semblance of control.</p>
