        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy registered zero growth in July, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.4% expansion in June. This stagnation, primarily driven by broad-based weakness in manufacturing, adds pressure on the government to boost growth and on the Bank of England to manage persistent inflation. Economists widely anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of 2025, with the upcoming Autumn Budget and potential interest rate adjustments by the Bank of England being critical factors. Businesses are reportedly delaying investment decisions, awaiting clarity on fiscal plans and monetary policy to emerge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three advanced specialized island-landing vessels, part of the 'Dong Gong' fleet, have been observed bearing hull numbers 401, 402, and 403 while docked in mainland China. According to a former Chinese military instructor, these markings confirm the ships are now in service with the PLA’s Eastern Theatre Command, indicating their operational readiness. Drone footage shows the barges equipped with multiple legs designed to lift the craft clear of water during landing, alongside extended bridge decks and bow-fitted cable-stayed bridge towers. This deployment enhances China's capabilities in maritime operations.</p>

          <p>UFC chief Dana White clashed with a reporter during a press conference for the highly anticipated super-fight between Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Terence Crawford, his first major boxing event since launching a Saudi-backed venture. The confrontation arose from questions regarding the Muhammad Ali Act, a US law designed to protect boxers' rights and prevent monopolies, which White is spearheading efforts to amend. Critics argue White's model could restrict fighters with exclusive contracts and reduce their share of revenue, sparking a debate about the future of boxing. The incident briefly overshadowed the fighters' traditional pre-bout declarations.</p>

Kirk, 31, was killed at Utah Valley University, prompting a massive ongoing manhunt for the unidentified suspect. Officials have released new photos and video of a person of interest, and a high-powered rifle believed to be the murder weapon was recovered nearby. The state intends to pursue the death penalty if the case proceeds to trial, with the FBI offering a $100,000 reward for information.</p>

While Israel asserts its right to self-defense and adherence to legal frameworks, the scale of death and destruction, coupled with allegations of using starvation as a weapon, raise serious questions.

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk's body was transported from Utah to his home state of Arizona aboard Air Force Two, the vice president's plane, following his assassination. Vice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance accompanied Kirk's widow, Erika, during this solemn journey. President Trump has announced plans to attend the funeral for Kirk, a 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA and a close ally who played a significant role in his administration's personnel decisions. The gesture highlights the high regard in which Kirk was held by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>China's third and newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has sailed through the Taiwan Strait and into the South China Sea to conduct scientific research trials and training missions. The Chinese navy stated this cross-regional exercise is routine and not directed at any specific target, despite China claiming the Taiwan Strait as its territory, a claim rejected by Taiwan. This movement signifies China's continued expansion of its naval power, aiming to broaden its Pacific reach and challenge the US and its allies.

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and significantly expand high-density housing near public transit hubs. The legislation, which allows for buildings up to nine stories near certain transit stops, aims to address the state's severe housing shortage. Critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, argue it's a "one-size-fits-all mandate" that strips local authorities of control and could alter single-family communities. Support for the bill surged after amendments were added to include union hiring for certain projects.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned of an "according" response to what he termed a "witch hunt" against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, after Brazil's Supreme Court sentenced him to 27 years for plotting a coup. Rubio's remarks echoed former President Donald Trump's earlier imposition of tariffs on Brazilian goods, framing them as retaliation for Bolsonaro's prosecution. Brazil's incumbent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva denounced Washington's actions as an infringement on national sovereignty and vowed to retaliate against any unilateral tariff increases.

The prosecution presented mobile phone data, security footage, and a handwritten note as evidence of a "carefully crafted and deadly serious" plot.
