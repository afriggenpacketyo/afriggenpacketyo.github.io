          <p>Devastating floods in Mokwa, Nigeria, have reportedly claimed over 700 lives after torrential rains swept through towns like Tiffin Maza and Anguwan Hausawa. Local officials have ceased rescue efforts, believing no survivors remain, and are preparing to address disease risks by exhuming buried corpses. Residents recounted the catastrophe, describing homes and family members being washed away. The National Emergency Management Agency has initiated relief efforts, acknowledging the widespread economic impact and infrastructure damage caused by the floods, which are considered the worst in the area in 60 years.

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate endorsed by Donald Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. The outcome signals a potential shift towards a more populist and nationalist direction for Poland, influencing its foreign policy and legislation. Nawrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, succeeds Andrzej Duda and brings a history of embracing nationalist narratives, including efforts to remove Soviet Red Army monuments. While the prime minister holds most day-to-day power, the president's influence over foreign policy and veto power could hinder the current government's agenda. This article discusses the political ramifications of the election results.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The UK Airspace Design Service will redesign flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago, to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly. These changes also aim to reduce aviation's climate change impact and accommodate new technologies like flying taxis. While the government touts environmental benefits, some groups caution against simply increasing the number of flights.

The Kremlin tasked a fugitive financier, recruited by Russian intelligence, to surveil and assassinate Grozev. While the team involved is now imprisoned, the financier resides in Moscow, highlighting the ongoing threat Grozev faces. The story underscores the lengths to which Putin will go to silence dissent and the vulnerability of individuals facing unchecked power, balanced by Grozev's continued determination to speak the truth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a "Gold Card" program, offering wealthy foreigners a fast track to U.S. residency for a $5 million fee. Immigration lawyers report significant interest, viewing the card as a way to bypass red tape and potentially gain favorable tax implications. While Trump suggests proceeds would help reduce the national debt, experts consider this unrealistic, and similar programs in other countries have faced challenges related to illicit funds. Concerns arise about managing the optics of welcoming wealthy immigrants while detaining others, and the legality of the program without congressional approval is debated.

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Istanbul for U.S.-brokered peace talks, aimed at ending Russia's three-year invasion. The talks come a day after Ukraine launched a drone attack on strategic bomber bases deep inside Russian territory. Despite pressure from the Trump administration, previous talks have failed to achieve a ceasefire, with Russia retaining maximalist war goals. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy is calling for a full ceasefire and the release of prisoners, while long-range drone and missile attacks continue. The peace talks are a reflection of ongoing international tensions.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Family Dynamic" by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships, birth order, and achievements shape a person's life. Studies suggest eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, influenced by increased parental attention. Siblings act as vivid mirrors, challenging flaws and offering a unique perspective on one's best and worst traits. While birth order archetypes can be simplistic, sibling influence plays a significant role in shaping individual identities and choices. The author's personal experiences with her siblings illustrate these dynamics.</p>
