          <p>China's renowned Shaolin Temple has a new leader after its former abbot of over 25 years was removed amid an investigation into alleged financial and sexual misconduct. Shi Yinle, previously the abbot of White Horse Temple, has been appointed to lead the 1,500-year-old monastery, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the birthplace of Zen Buddhism. The disgraced former abbot, Shi Yongxin, has had his Buddhist credentials revoked and associated companies deregistered, marking a significant leadership change for the cultural institution.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike on a correctional facility in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of at least 17 inmates and left 42 others wounded. Ukrainian officials reported that Russian forces used eight high-explosive glide bombs in the overnight attack, which also damaged nearby homes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the act as a deliberate strike, while the justice ministry confirmed the casualties were all inmates and that the attack destroyed several buildings within the prison complex.</p>

The procession will move along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge, where thousands of tributes have been left for the singer, who passed away at age 76. The public event, funded by Osbourne's family, precedes a private funeral and allows the community to honor the musician, whom the Lord Mayor described as a "son of Birmingham" who put the city on the map.</p>

          <p>The recent handsy behavior between "Fantastic Four" actors Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby is part of a broader Hollywood trend where co-stars use physical chemistry to generate buzz for their projects. While Pascal attributes his use of physical touch to managing anxiety, public relations experts suggest such actions are often a calculated tactic to build hype for a film. This promotional strategy, also seen with actors like Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey, can be effective but also risks public scrutiny if it is perceived as inauthentic or inappropriate.</p>

          <p>A report from insurance company Munich Re indicates that natural disasters have caused over $131 billion in global economic losses in the first half of 2025, with $80 billion of that being insured.

This tariff differential could incentivize U.S. firms to source more goods from Britain and may even prompt some EU manufacturers to shift production to the U.K. to avoid the higher duties, creating a potential economic upside for the post-Brexit nation.

          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by its investment banking division, which saw a 10% year-on-year income increase due to heightened market volatility and robust trading activity. The results indicate that the bank's strategic plan, which includes cost reductions and a sharpened focus on its investment arm, is on track to deliver higher returns for investors.

          <p>Manchester United has identified Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets to reinforce their striking options, though any new signing depends on the club offloading other players first. Acquiring either player presents challenges, as Villa is reportedly unwilling to sell Watkins and has set a high price tag, while Newcastle is also interested in Sesko. The club acknowledges the need to sell players to fund a new arrival, which may not happen until closer to the transfer deadline.</p>

While demand for air travel remains strong, analysts note that Air India's complex restructuring is a near-term drag on SIA's bottom line, and increased market competition is normalizing the airline's previously high operating margins.
