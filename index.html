          <p>Social media platform Reddit has filed a lawsuit against the AI search engine company Perplexity, accusing it of illegally scraping user-generated content to train its artificial intelligence models. The complaint also names three other data collection firms as defendants, alleging they masked their identities to bypass Reddit's protections and steal copyrighted material. Perplexity has denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit an act of "extortion" and a tactic to pressure other AI companies like Google and OpenAI into more favorable data licensing deals. This case highlights the escalating legal and ethical conflicts between content creators and the AI industry over the use of public data.</p>

          <p>Europe's automotive industry is confronting significant production challenges due to a deepening dependency on Chinese supply chains for critical components. A recent warning from chip supplier Nexperia about potential disruptions, coupled with a sharp decline in China's rare-earth exports, has intensified concerns about manufacturing stability. Carmakers are struggling to transition to electric vehicles as domestic suppliers falter and key resources like batteries and magnets are primarily sourced from abroad. This situation threatens not only production lines but also the economic prosperity of manufacturing hubs like Germany, which has already seen tens of thousands of auto industry jobs disappear.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced a strategic goal to double the country's exports to nations other than the United States within the next decade. This policy shift comes in response to U.S. tariffs that have created investment uncertainty and threatened key Canadian industries like auto, steel, and lumber. Carney emphasized that the era of an ever-closer economic relationship with the U.S. is over, stating that Canada must diversify its trade partnerships to ensure its own economic security. The plan includes re-engaging with global economic powers such as India and China to reduce Canada's heavy reliance on the American market, which currently receives over 75% of its exports.</p>

          <p>The UK government's inquiry into grooming gangs is facing a crisis as four abuse survivors on its advisory panel have resigned, demanding the dismissal of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips. The survivors accuse Phillips of betraying their trust by publicly dismissing their concerns that the inquiry's scope was being diluted, which they say downplays the racial and religious motivations of their abusers. Their joint letter outlines several conditions for their return, including the appointment of a judge to lead the probe and a renewed focus on group-based exploitation. The controversy has intensified political divisions, with the government insisting the inquiry will remain focused while trying to manage the fallout from the resignations.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, a move expected to disrupt energy supplies to their primary customers, China and India. These sanctions are designed to cripple the Kremlin's ability to finance its war in Ukraine by targeting roughly half of Russia's crude exports. While a wind-down period until November 21 is intended to prevent immediate market chaos, refiners in both Asian nations are now scrambling to ensure their supplies are not directly linked to the sanctioned entities. The measures represent a significant escalation from the previous price-cap mechanism and will likely force China and India to seek alternative oil sources from OPEC and the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced significant new sanctions against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, aiming to compel President Vladimir Putin to engage in serious negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. The move follows months of pressure from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and bipartisan calls for tougher action against Russia's economic engine. The sanctions were announced shortly after a deadly wave of Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine killed at least six people. President Trump stated the sanctions were intended to make Putin more "reasonable" and expressed hope they could be withdrawn if Russia agrees to a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>Residents in Russia's Belgorod region, near the Ukrainian border, are experiencing increasingly frequent blackouts and air-raid sirens due to a surge in Ukrainian drone attacks. Analysis indicates that the number of drone strikes has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2025, with Kyiv openly stating the attacks are retaliation for Russia's bombardment of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The strikes have targeted power plants and substations, leaving tens of thousands without electricity and disrupting daily life in a key logistics hub for Russian forces. This escalation marks a new phase where Ukraine is directly targeting Russian civilian infrastructure in response to similar attacks on its own cities.</p>

The event, which attracted over 400 participants, challenged teams to build a project from scratch using AI tools, resulting in around 150 submissions. The experience highlighted that AI has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for non-technical individuals to create tech products, making product sense and creativity more valuable than ever. While foundational engineering skills remain important for debugging and logic, the rapid advancement of AI tools means developers must continuously adapt or risk becoming obsolete in a landscape where teams are becoming smaller and more efficient.</p>

          <p>Details are emerging about the private donors funding the construction of a new ballroom at the White House, a project President Trump estimates will cost around $300 million. While a full list has not been released, companies expected to contribute include tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Google, as well as cryptocurrency firms such as Coinbase and Ripple. Some of these companies have already secured lucrative government contracts during Trump's second term. It was revealed in court documents that Google's parent company, Alphabet, will contribute $22 million to the project as part of a legal settlement with Trump, raising questions about transparency and potential pay-to-play arrangements.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is forecast to bring heavy rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center predicts the slow-moving storm could drop 5 to 10 inches of rain, creating risks of significant flash flooding and landslides. While the storm is expected to strengthen and could become a hurricane by Friday, its long-term track remains uncertain, with models showing various potential paths. A hurricane watch is currently in effect for southwestern Haiti, but the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>The final debate for New York City's mayoral race was characterized by heated personal attacks rather than substantive policy discussions, particularly between candidates Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo accused Mamdani of lacking new ideas, while Mamdani criticized Cuomo's record as governor and questioned him about past sexual harassment allegations. The topic of recent ICE raids quickly devolved into a proxy battle over who would better handle Donald Trump. Candidate Curtis Sliwa provided moments of levity, criticizing both his rivals, while Mamdani faced repeated accusations of evading direct questions on issues like education and zoning reforms, leaving the overall dynamic of the race largely unchanged.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its campaign against alleged maritime drug trafficking by conducting its first-ever airstrikes in the Pacific Ocean, killing five people in two separate attacks on boats. These strikes mark a significant geographical shift from previous operations, which were concentrated in the Caribbean Sea. The Guardian revealed that the CIA is providing the bulk of the intelligence for these controversial attacks. The Trump administration has justified the lethal force by claiming the targeted vessels are affiliated with designated terrorist organizations, a legal theory that has drawn widespread condemnation and scrutiny from civil liberties groups and legal experts.</p>

Once a bustling community hub, the mall has seen a long decline, and its closure marks the end of an era for many local residents who grew up there.

The central bank cited stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook but warned of uncertainties related to ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. While maintaining its rate cut stance to support growth, the bank remains cautious about fueling further borrowing, especially after recently tightening property loan rules.

          <p>President Donald Trump called on American cattle ranchers to lower their prices for consumers, asserting in a social media post that his tariffs are the "only reason they are doing so well." The comments follow his suggestion that the U.S. might import beef from Argentina to combat rising domestic prices, a proposal that has drawn criticism from farmers and industry groups. Ranchers argue that high prices are due to factors like drought and a multi-decade low in cattle supply, not profiteering. The president's remarks highlight the growing tension between his administration's trade policies and their direct impact on the U.S. agricultural sector. (not investment advice)</p>

As of Wednesday, over 3.4 million mail-in ballots have been returned, a number comparable to the same point in the 2024 presidential election. Returned ballots from registered Democrats are currently outpacing those from Republicans and no-party-preference voters. The proposition, a Democratic-led effort to counter Republican gerrymandering in other states, has drawn national attention, with former President Obama endorsing the measure.
