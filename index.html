          <p>A recent survey reveals a growing trend of "bleisure" travel, where employees, particularly executives, bring family or loved ones on business trips. This practice helps professionals balance work and family life, providing opportunities for connection and creating budget-friendly vacations. While many companies quietly accept this, employees often navigate a policy gray area regarding expenses and insurance, though the consensus is that business objectives must remain the priority. The global market for blended travel is projected to grow significantly in the coming decade.</p>

          <p>Despite its reputation for financial prudence, a growing number of workers in Singapore are living paycheck to paycheck, with recent data showing 60% of the workforce in this position. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of rising inflation, which has outpaced wage growth, and high structural costs for housing and imported goods. Additionally, cultural shifts, including a greater emphasis on experiential spending and aspirational lifestyles, contribute to lower savings rates among younger generations. This situation highlights a complex interplay of economic pressures and changing societal values in one of the world's most expensive cities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal trial has concluded regarding the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, with the judge expressing skepticism about the government's legal arguments. The case centers on a lawsuit by California's governor, who argues the deployment for immigration enforcement violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic military use. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer questioned the Justice Department's claim that the law is irrelevant and pressed for clarity on the limits of presidential power to deploy a "national police force." The ruling, which is pending, could have significant implications for the separation of powers and federal-state relations.</p>

          <p>Newly released body camera footage shows the arrest of a recent Kentucky Powerball winner in Florida after he allegedly kicked a deputy in the face. The incident occurred at a resort where deputies were responding to a fight involving the man, James Farthing, and another hotel guest. Farthing, who had a lengthy criminal history and was on parole, was subdued with a taser and now faces multiple charges, including felony battery on a law enforcement officer. He and his mother had recently won a $167.3 million jackpot, the largest in Kentucky's history.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," has concluded its hearing, leaving the central question of who controls the facility unanswered. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe argue its construction violated federal law by skipping environmental assessments, posing a threat to the fragile ecosystem and endangered species like the Florida panther. The state and federal governments claim the facility is state-run, thus exempt from federal environmental review, but could not clarify ultimate authority to the judge. The case highlights a significant conflict between immigration policy, environmental protection, and state versus federal jurisdiction.</p>

Daley faces up to five years in prison if convicted on the federal charges. The case follows the high-profile arrest of a suspect in Thompson's murder, who was allegedly motivated by anger over corporate greed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, have co-signed a letter demanding that Israel stop the "weaponization of aid" as starvation worsens in Gaza. The groups report that since March, Israel has implemented stricter regulations that block lifesaving supplies if organizations are deemed to "delegitimize" the state, effectively halting most NGO aid deliveries. This has left hospitals without essential supplies and exacerbated a dire humanitarian crisis, with thousands of tons of food and medical goods blocked just kilometers away. Israel maintains the rules are necessary to ensure aid aligns with its national interests and prevents diversion by Hamas.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American fugitive who faked his death and fled to the UK, has been found guilty of a sexual assault charge from 2008 in a Utah court. The victim testified that Rossi, with whom she had a brief and controlling relationship, forced himself on her. Rossi, who was extradited from Scotland after being discovered in a hospital, declined to testify and now faces sentencing for this conviction, with a separate trial for another sexual assault charge scheduled for September. His case drew international attention due to his elaborate attempts to evade justice by using multiple aliases and feigning illness.</p>

          <p>According to a new Gallup poll, the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, a record low not seen since 1958. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Experts suggest that increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks, such as cancer and anxiety, is driving the trend. The shift is also supported by the rising popularity of non-alcoholic alternatives and social trends like "Dry January," indicating a significant change in cultural attitudes toward alcohol.</p>

          <p>At least four people, including a family of three, have died as a result of severe storms and flash flooding in Tennessee. The family, consisting of two adults and a child, was killed when a tree fell on their car in East Ridge, near Chattanooga. Another man's body was recovered after he was reportedly swept away by floodwaters after driving around a barricade. The region experienced record-breaking rainfall, with Chattanooga Airport recording its second-wettest day ever, prompting a local state of emergency and numerous rescue operations.</p>

          <p>A multi-week investigation into illegal cockfighting in San Bernardino County, dubbed "Crowing Rooster," has resulted in 56 arrests and the seizure of 3,500 birds. The seized birds were subsequently euthanized as they could not be safely rehabilitated or rehomed due to their conditioning for fighting. Authorities also recovered firearms, illicit drugs, and over $250,000 in cash during the operation. Animal welfare advocates noted that such illegal ventures are often linked to a wider range of criminal activities, highlighting the extensive impact of these operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing environmental regulations for the commercial spaceflight industry, a move expected to benefit companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. The order directs the Department of Transportation to streamline or eliminate environmental reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act for launch licenses. While the administration frames this as a way to boost innovation and U.S. leadership in space, environmental groups have condemned the order as reckless, warning it puts wildlife and local communities at risk from rocket launches that can be highly disruptive and destructive.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated there is a "viable chance" for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, speaking ahead of a crucial summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin. Starmer emphasized that any peace deal must protect Ukraine's territorial integrity and be backed by credible security guarantees from a coalition of allies. His comments came after European leaders held a joint call with Trump to align their positions, amid concerns that Ukraine might be pressured to cede territory. The diplomatic activity underscores the high stakes of the upcoming talks in Alaska.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to continue freezing billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The court decided that the international aid groups who brought the lawsuit did not have the legal standing to challenge the President's action. This decision overturns a lower court's injunction that had blocked the funding freeze, which affects nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives. A dissenting judge called the ruling "startling," arguing it allows the President to refuse to spend appropriated funds based on policy disagreements.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a man in Big Bear Lake, California, for allegedly operating an illegal psychedelic mushroom business out of a location named the Jah Healing Cannabis Church. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department executed a search warrant following citizen complaints and found Christopher Tindall in possession of psilocybin mushrooms. Tindall was arrested on suspicion of felony illegal sales of a controlled substance. The same "church," which considers cannabis its sacrament, had previously been shut down by the county for functioning as an illegal dispensary.</p>

          <p>Viral images of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have sparked alarm online, but wildlife officials have clarified the cause. The animals are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus, a disease common in the Midwest that causes benign tumors to grow on their heads. The virus, spread by insects and rabbit contact, is generally harmless to the rabbits unless the growths interfere with eating, and it cannot be transmitted to humans or other species. The phenomenon is not new and is believed to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope," a fabled rabbit with antlers.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, low-income Americans are facing increasing difficulty affording air conditioning due to soaring electricity costs. The article highlights the struggles of individuals who rely on federal assistance programs like LIHEAP to pay their utility bills. However, the Trump administration's budget proposal aims to eliminate this program, which serves over six million people, calling it a "failed program." Experts note that climate change is driving up electricity demand and costs, placing a disproportionate burden on the most vulnerable households who face serious health risks from extreme heat.</p>
