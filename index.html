          <h2>Captive-Bred Axolotls Show Promising Survival Rates in Restored Mexican Wetlands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls, a critically endangered species, are thriving in restored wetlands in Mexico City. The study tracked 18 axolotls released in 2017 and 2018, noting they gained weight and successfully hunted prey while avoiding predators. This indicates that captive-bred axolotls can adapt to and survive in the wild, even in man-made habitats, offering hope for the species' comeback and potentially mitigating the effects of habitat degradation and climate change. The axolotl is significant to Mexican culture and history, making its conservation a priority for both scientific and cultural reasons.</p>

          <p>Researchers at a top Chinese defense electronics institute claim they can track advanced US stealth radars using modified commercial equipment. The team from the 38th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation stated that commercially available spectrum analyzers can pinpoint emissions from US low-probability-of-intercept radar (LPIR) with high accuracy, even through electronic jamming. This could potentially alter the dynamics of electronic warfare, as LPIR is used in advanced US air and missile defense systems and stealth aircraft.</p>

          <p>The article argues that universities, particularly research universities, are vital to society because they embody the First Amendment's commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and truth. Universities are uniquely structured to discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge, and they deserve special standing within First Amendment jurisprudence, similar to the press. The author contends that universities should actively defend their role and seek legal precedents that protect their academic freedom, especially in the face of government intrusion and funding threats. The author emphasizes the importance of universities remaining free from political control to fulfill their mission of advancing understanding and serving as societal critics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is struggling to fill critical positions after offering employees deferred resignation packages. The agency is now seeking lateral transfers to fill 73 open roles, leading to anger and frustration among employees who accepted the resignation offer due to fears of potential layoffs. The situation raises concerns about the government effectively paying two salaries for the same job through September and the rationale behind offering resignations to those in mission-critical roles.</p>

          <p>The article reports an increase in whooping cough cases across the United States, with preliminary data showing double the number of cases compared to the same period last year. Experts attribute this rise to decreased mask usage and social distancing following the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a cyclical pattern of the disease. The article also notes concern that declining vaccination rates and growing anti-vaccine sentiment are contributing to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses. The article emphasizes the importance of vaccination, especially for pregnant women and infants, to protect against the potentially deadly disease.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, injured approximately 50 people, including an 11-year-old child. Ukrainian officials reported that the attack involved multiple drones targeting civilian infrastructure, residential buildings, and shops, causing fires and significant damage. This attack occurred shortly after another Russian strike on Zaporizhzhia and as Russia prepares for a three-day ceasefire for its World War II holiday. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, emphasizing that they targeted homes rather than military sites.</p>

          <p>Five people, including three women, a child, and the pilot, survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The survivors stood on top of the plane surrounded by alligators and an anaconda, relying on cassava flour for sustenance while awaiting rescue. The pilot believes leaking petrol kept the predators at bay, and the group was eventually rescued by a helicopter after being discovered by local fishermen.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's statement that Crimea will remain with Russia, DW interviewed Crimean Tatars to gather their perspectives on the situation. Many Crimean Tatars expressed disappointment, emphasizing their historical struggle for the right to live on their land and their resistance to Russian occupation. While some acknowledge the need to end the war, they fear that recognizing Crimea as Russian territory would legitimize territorial concessions and endanger those living under Russian rule. The Crimean Tatars highlight the importance of Ukraine's refusal to recognize the annexation as a symbol of hope and connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that despite a recent agreement with the United States, Ukraine is unlikely to supplant China as a major supplier of critical minerals in the near future. The majority of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in Russian-occupied territories, and the country lacks the processing capacity to compete with China's established industry. This means American companies will likely continue to face challenges in securing these vital materials as China restricts supply amid ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding a general election amid economic challenges posed by global trade tensions and rising living costs. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is seeking a strong mandate for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to navigate the country through these uncertainties. While the PAP has dominated Singaporean politics for decades, the opposition is gaining ground by focusing on issues such as the cost of living and housing affordability. The election is seen as a test of Wong's leadership and the PAP's ability to address voters' concerns in a rapidly changing global landscape.</p>
