          <p>Authorities in San Bernardino County are scrutinizing the story of Rebecca Haro, who reported her 7-month-old son Emmanuel was kidnapped during an assault. Investigators noted significant inconsistencies in her statements, leading her to cease cooperation with the police. The lack of suspect information or security footage has prevented an Amber Alert, and an advocacy group has withdrawn a reward due to the questionable circumstances. The sheriff's department continues to investigate the infant's disappearance, urging public assistance while acknowledging the possibility of foul play in the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that China's economic problem of "involution," characterized by intense, self-defeating competition, is a symptom of deeper issues beyond oversupply. The author argues that local governments and enterprises engage in this excessive competition due to a lack of other viable options, leading to near-zero profit margins and stifling new investment. The piece suggests that the issue is also rooted in demand-side problems, indicating that simply curbing supply-side incentives will not resolve the underlying economic stagnation.</p>

This incident follows a separate case in July where another airman was arrested for the shooting death of a fellow service member, which led the Air Force to suspend the use of the Sig Sauer M18 handgun.</p>

          <p>Leeds United celebrated their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over Everton, driven by the intense atmosphere at their Elland Road stadium.

Despite dominating the first half, Leeds struggled to score from open play but demonstrated resilience to secure the win. The article highlights the crucial role the home crowd's energy will play in Leeds' campaign to remain in the top flight this season.</p>

          <p>In response to efforts by former President Trump and Texas Republicans to create more GOP-friendly districts, California's Democratic leaders have initiated a plan to redraw their state's congressional maps. The proposal, which would go before voters in a special election, aims to neutralize potential Republican gains in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democratic lawmakers frame the move as a necessary defense of democracy, while Republicans accuse them of a partisan power grab that subverts the will of voters who previously established an independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump announced his intention to issue an executive order to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, baselessly calling the method "corrupt." However, legal experts assert that such an action would be unconstitutional, as Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution grants states, and then Congress, the authority to regulate federal elections, not the president.

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest accrued on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. Currently, lenders can hold these funds in an escrow account and keep the interest earned while homeowners wait for the money to be released for rebuilding. The new legislation, which now goes to the governor, mandates that homeowners will be guaranteed at least 2% interest on these funds, closing a loophole in existing state law and providing more financial support to disaster victims.</p>

The author points to bizarre applications, like an AI-reanimated dead teenager, and the extreme rhetoric from Silicon Valley, which creates a sense of psychosis and instability for the public. The piece questions whether the technology will ever deliver on its grandest promises, suggesting the real danger is not a superintelligence takeover but a "good enough" technology that reorients society, pollutes the internet, and outsources human cognition for mediocre returns.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds U.S. Wages Have Not Kept Pace with Inflation Over the Past Four Years</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Bankrate indicates that the average American's wages have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, eroding household purchasing power. The report highlights that some professions, particularly educators, have fallen even further behind, while workers in leisure, hospitality, and healthcare have seen wage growth outpace inflation. This persistent gap helps explain ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households continue to feel the strain of the cost-of-living crisis that began during the pandemic.

          <p>A Florida woman, Kim Muratori, won a $66,000 arbitration award against a Mercedes-Benz dealership after discovering the certified pre-owned car she bought had nearly double the advertised mileage and a damaged suspension. Despite the ruling, which also required the dealer to take back the car and refund her payments, the dealership has stalled for months and refused to pay. The dealership, a subsidiary of AutoNation, has chosen to drag out the legal process, forcing Muratori to continue incurring legal fees while she waits for the resolution mandated by the arbitrator.</p>

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning following a series of federal immigration raids they described as the most significant in weeks. The enforcement actions, which included detentions at a car wash and a Home Depot, have spread fear and uncertainty throughout the city's large immigrant community. One incident, captured on video, showed masked agents tackling a U.S. citizen who was a bystander. Anaheim officials have condemned the raids, stating they destabilize the community and do not improve public safety, and have joined a lawsuit challenging the federal actions.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a U.S. framework and would involve an initial 60-day truce in exchange for the release of about half of the remaining Israeli hostages. It is uncertain how Israel will respond, as its government has previously demanded the release of all hostages at once. The news comes as Israeli forces reportedly advanced into a southern neighborhood of Gaza City, intensifying military pressure on the group.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Polari Prize, an award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following a controversy surrounding the nomination of author John Boyne. Boyne was longlisted for his novel "Earth," but his inclusion sparked backlash due to an article he wrote supporting J.K. Rowling's views on trans rights. In protest, more than 10 other nominated authors withdrew, a judge resigned, and over 800 publishing figures signed an open letter of criticism. Organizers said the event was "overshadowed by hurt and anger" and will pause to review its governance and judging panels.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former President Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal, reversing his position from the previous week. This declaration came as Zelenskyy and several European leaders were pushing for U.S.-backed security guarantees as a core component of any lasting peace. European allies, including Germany's chancellor, pushed back, insisting a ceasefire is essential for credible negotiations. Trump also announced he had initiated arrangements for a direct meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, to be followed by a trilateral summit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn, with Bitcoin falling to around $115,000 after recently hitting a new all-time high. The drop was attributed to broader macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected inflation data that cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. This sentiment triggered a wave of forced selling, with over $500 million in long positions liquidated across the market in 24 hours. Comments from the Treasury Secretary clarifying the scope of a strategic bitcoin reserve also contributed to the negative market movement. (not investment advice)</p>

This follows a recent surge in the company's stock price after it signed two 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack.
