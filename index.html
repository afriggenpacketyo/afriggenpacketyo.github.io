          <p>Former White House national security advisor Mike Waltz was seen using a modified version of the Signal app, potentially violating records retention laws. The app, reportedly a "fork" of Signal by TeleMessage, adds archiving capabilities to cloned messaging apps, allowing government agencies and businesses to adhere to regulations by instantly backing up chats. While the White House claims Signal is an approved app for government use, Signal representatives have stated that they cannot guarantee the privacy or security properties of unofficial versions. The article highlights the controversy surrounding the use of encrypted messaging by top Trump administration officials, including discussions about military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. </p>

          <p>Netflix's stock has reached an all-time high, trading positively for 11 consecutive days, marking the company's longest winning streak ever. This surge follows a strong earnings report revealing revenue growth driven by subscriptions and advertising. While traditional media stocks have suffered due to market volatility caused by Trump's trade policies, Netflix has remained largely unaffected, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting no significant impact on the business. JPMorgan analysts predict further upside for Netflix shares, citing its leadership in global streaming and the upcoming Advertising Upfronts as potential catalysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wall Street has bounced back from April's sharp sell-off, fueled by hopes of trade talks, but the economic consequences of President Trump's policies continue to worry investors. The S&P 500 has rebounded to pre-tariff levels, driven by a strong jobs report and indications from the Trump administration that they are willing to engage in trade talks with China. Despite the recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, and concerns persist about the potential for tariffs to slow economic growth as companies struggle to forecast future performance and may be forced to raise prices. The article underscores the volatility in the market due to uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian human rights advocate and Columbia University student, recounts his detention following a citizenship naturalization interview, which he describes as a trap orchestrated by the Department of Homeland Security. Mahdawi believes his detention is a result of his opposition to Israel's actions in Gaza and an attempt by the Trump administration to suppress dissent and shield the Israeli government from criticism. Despite spending 16 nights in jail, Mahdawi expresses hope in democratic principles and emphasizes the connection between the struggles for justice for Americans and Palestinians, urging Americans to support peace and democracy. He was eventually released after a federal judge ruled in his favor.</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was found guilty of second-degree murder and domestic battery in the death of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy was found dead in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to her head, initially dispatched as a suicide, but investigators grew suspicious due to clues at the scene, including a packed duffle bag and clean towels in the dryer. The prosecution argued that Dan killed Kendy by putting her in a carotid restraint hold, a maneuver he learned in law enforcement training, while the defense maintained Kendy's death was a suicide. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), has formally designated the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as extremist after a three-year investigation. The BfV concluded that the AfD's actions contravene the constitution's core principles, including human dignity, democracy, and the rule of law. This designation, extending to the party's national organization, is likely to further isolate the AfD, which is known for its anti-immigration and nationalist platform, despite its electoral success. The intelligence agency's designation is expected to strengthen efforts to exclude the AfD from key roles in the Bundestag.</p>

          <p>Major footwear brands, including Nike, Adidas, and Skechers, are urging President Trump for an exemption from his reciprocal tariffs, citing an "existential threat" to the footwear industry. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group argues that the tariffs, particularly those affecting imports from China, Vietnam, and Cambodia, will disproportionately impact lower and middle-income families. The association warns that the tariffs will lead to higher prices for consumers and will not incentivize manufacturing to return to the U.S., while disrupting business models and supply chains. The letter emphasizes the urgency of the situation, requesting immediate relief from the tariffs.</p>

The plot centers around a farm boy who accidentally kills a rancher and is rescued by his outlaw grandfather, played by Alec Baldwin, with the film drawing comparisons to Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $6 billion cut to NASA's budget while redirecting $1 billion towards Mars-focused missions, aligning with Elon Musk's vision. The budget prioritizes lunar exploration to compete with China and human missions to Mars, while streamlining NASA's workforce and terminating "unaffordable" programs. This includes retiring the SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Gateway programs, and ending green aviation spending and the Mars Sample Return Program. The budget shift is expected to benefit SpaceX, which has long sought to launch manned missions to Mars, while impacting other aerospace contractors.</p>

          <p>Temu, the online retailer known for ultra-discounted items shipped directly from China, has suspended direct shipping from China to the U.S. as the de minimis tariff loophole expires. This change, driven by an executive order signed by President Trump and new tariffs on Chinese goods, forces Temu to rely on U.S.-based warehouses and local sellers. The company has shifted its website to only display products shipped from within the country, aiming to maintain pricing for U.S. shoppers and improve service levels. The move reflects the impact of escalating trade tensions and the end of duty-free entry for low-value shipments.</p>

          <p>With the United States facing a significant measles outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will direct federal health agencies to explore potential new treatments for the disease, including vitamins. This decision has drawn criticism, with experts fearing it will undermine public confidence in vaccines. Critics argue that Kennedy should focus on promoting the measles vaccine, which has proven 97 percent effective, rather than untested treatments. The decision comes as the CDC reports over 930 cases nationwide, primarily linked to an outbreak in the Southwest.</p>

          <p>Paramilitary forces in Sudan are accused of killing over 100 civilians in an attack on the city of Nahud, according to the Sudan Doctors Network. The group alleges that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out a "large-scale massacre," including the deaths of 21 children and 15 women, and looted medical supplies and other resources. The attack occurred as the RSF pressed its offensive to seize Darfur, and the UN human rights chief has expressed alarm over the escalating violence in the region.
