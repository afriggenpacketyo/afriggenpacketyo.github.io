            <p>President Trump announced a potential 50% tariff increase on Chinese imports if China proceeds with its planned retaliatory tariffs. This action follows Trump's earlier imposition of reciprocal tariffs on numerous nations, aimed at addressing trade imbalances. The threat has spooked Wall Street, with economists fearing potential economic slowdown or recession. Trump insists on immediate negotiations with other nations, including Japan, to restructure trade agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Senator Mark Warner, a leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has questioned the legality of President Trump's extension of the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's US assets. Warner argues that the proposed deal, which would allow ByteDance to retain a significant equity stake and operational role, fails to meet legal requirements for eliminating ByteDance's influence over TikTok's US operations under a 2024 law. The deal aims to spin off TikTok's US operations into a new US-based company majority-owned and operated by US investors.</p>

            <p>As President Trump's tariffs continue to impact the world economy, some Republicans in Congress are exploring ways to limit the president's authority to impose tariffs. Senator Chuck Grassley introduced a bill to reassert Congress' control over trade policy. The move comes amid concerns about the tariffs' effect on the stock market and consumer sentiment. The Constitution grants Congress the power over foreign trade, but that power has been ceded to the executive branch over time.</p>

This integrated approach aims to address social problems alongside physical health conditions. Early results show a decrease in GP visits, A&E attendances, and hospital admissions among the local population, but questions remain about scalability and funding.</p>
