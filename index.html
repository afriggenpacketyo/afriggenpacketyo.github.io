          <p>A volunteer at a Leicester church details a harrowing stalking campaign by a lay preacher after he rejected her advances. The article reveals how the victim's initial complaints were dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, who instead accused the victim of witchcraft, compounding the trauma. The ordeal, which involved online harassment and real-world threats, eventually led to the stalker's conviction and an apology from the church, highlighting significant failures in safeguarding. The victim continues to deal with the long-term emotional and financial repercussions of the institutional betrayal.</p>

The UK government strongly condemned Bob Vylan for leading chants calling for "death to the IDF," which were broadcast live by the BBC. The broadcaster labeled the comments "deeply offensive" and has removed the set from its on-demand iPlayer service. The police review will determine if the on-stage remarks constitute a criminal offense, adding a layer of controversy to the renowned music festival.</p>

This year's events took on a more political tone, responding to efforts by the Trump administration to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender individuals. Organizers adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" to reflect the current climate. The marches also contended with a noticeable decline in corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader corporate retreat from diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>

          <p>Civil servants across China are reportedly forgoing dining out due to increasingly stringent and unpredictable local austerity measures. This shift in behavior is attributed to a phenomenon known as "ceng ceng jia ma," where local authorities add extra layers of control on top of central government regulations. An official from Sichuan province noted that his department head had banned eating out to avoid negative perceptions during a period of heightened scrutiny. The trend reflects the pervasive pressure on government employees to demonstrate frugality and avoid any appearance of impropriety.</p>

          <p>The Leadmill, a legendary music venue in Sheffield, has hosted its final gig after a 45-year history, following a prolonged battle with its landlords who acquired the building in 2017.

Musicians such as Richard Hawley have lamented the closure, comparing it to losing historical landmarks like The Cavern Club. While the new owners plan to keep it as a music venue, the end of The Leadmill's management marks a significant loss for the city's cultural identity.</p>

The bill, which includes extensions of the 2017 tax cuts and significant changes to Medicaid, overcame opposition from two Republicans and required last-minute negotiations to secure the support of several conservative holdouts. The legislation now faces a lengthy full reading on the Senate floor, as demanded by Democrats, before a final passage vote. The tight margin underscores the political challenges facing GOP leadership as they push to get the bill to the president's desk. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy, which will be part of a new 10-year plan for the NHS, aims to improve the nation's health without imposing specific sales targets on retailers.

          <p>Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a strong warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric targeting judges. Speaking at a judicial conference, he cautioned that when politicians frame judges as part of a political dispute, it can incite violence, referencing serious threats made against judges for simply performing their duties. Without naming individuals, his comments appeared to allude to past criticisms from both President Donald Trump and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Roberts urged political figures on both sides to be mindful of the potential consequences of their words on judicial safety and independence.</p>

The protests, the largest in recent months, were sparked by public anger over alleged government corruption and ties to organized crime, recently inflamed by a deadly railway station roof collapse.

          <p>China's decision to halt exports of rare earth materials is accelerating international efforts to establish alternative production capabilities, though the process is expected to be difficult and expensive. An American firm, REalloys, is collaborating on a project to process ore from Brazil in a new Canadian facility, aiming to produce high-performance magnet materials by 2027. Analysts suggest that building a viable non-Chinese supply chain will likely require significant government subsidies and protective tariffs.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, especially during heatwaves. The dark, hard surfaces of buildings and roads in urban landscapes absorb and retain the sun's energy, slowly releasing it and raising air temperatures. In contrast, the vegetation and water in the countryside provide natural cooling through evaporation. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, this effect puts the growing global urban population at greater risk from extreme heat.</p>

The program is supported by cancer charities, who note that melanoma diagnoses are projected to rise in the coming years.
