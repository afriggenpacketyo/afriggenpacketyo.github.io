            <p>Former U.S. Representative Barbara Lee won Oakland's mayoral special election, defeating Loren Taylor, after a ranked-choice tally. Lee's victory follows a period of instability in Oakland, which saw four mayors in four months due to the recall and indictment of Sheng Thao on bribery charges. The city faces crises including homelessness, a significant budget deficit, and fluctuating crime rates, with Lee vowing to address public safety, fiscal issues, and corruption. Lee's campaign emphasized her experience and promised a fresh perspective, while Taylor aimed to shake up the political status quo.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, cautioned against repeating the tariff mistakes of the Great Depression era amid escalating trade tensions. Speaking at an event, Xie referenced the Smoot-Hawley Act, which is widely believed to have worsened the Great Depression, as a cautionary tale. He emphasized the importance of addressing the root causes of economic issues and fostering global economic growth rather than engaging in protectionist measures. The ambassador called for joint efforts to grow the global economy, rather than fighting over existing spoils.</p>

            <p>A recent report indicates that over one million abortions were performed in the U.S. in 2024, with approximately 155,000 individuals crossing state lines to access the procedure. This number is double what it was before the overturning of Roe v. Wade, highlighting the increased need for out-of-state travel to obtain abortions, especially in states like Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico. The report also notes that the Trump administration has cut the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports, raising concerns about the ability to track public health outcomes related to abortion access. Researchers estimate that 20-25% of individuals seeking abortions are unable to obtain them due to existing bans.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point amid growing discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism among Americans, with a significant increase in pessimism regarding the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, disapproval has risen among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers. The public expresses concerns about tariffs, inflation, and the potential for a recession, contributing to the president's negative economic approval rating.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine until midnight Sunday in Moscow, citing "humanitarian" considerations, which has been met with skepticism. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed the Russian army continued attempts to advance, while Russia's defense ministry stated its troops adhered to the ceasefire. Some view the truce as a PR move to improve relations with the Trump White House, while others see it as a genuine step towards ending the war. The ceasefire was declared at short notice, giving little time for either side to prepare.</p>

            <p>Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have acknowledged the significant changes brought about by Donald Trump's policies, with concerns primarily focused on the impact on international trade. While the government negotiates tariffs, Labour's approach to the financial sector seems relaxed, despite warnings about the risks to global financial stability. Experts suggest that Trump's policies could destabilize the global economy, particularly given the high levels of global debt. Labour is encouraged to consider the broader risks to financial stability, including those posed by private equity and shadow banking, rather than solely focusing on trade-related issues.</p>

            <p>China has taken a more active role in addressing the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, urging Rwanda to end its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw its troops from the DR Congo. This marks a shift from China's usual non-interference policy in African conflicts. China's involvement is likely driven by its significant mining interests in the region, particularly in areas affected by the conflict. The move aims to protect its economic interests and maintain relationships with both countries.</p>
