          <p>Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil is seeking $20 million in damages from the Trump administration, alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. His lawyers filed a claim asserting he was targeted for his pro-Palestinian advocacy and campus protests, which the government denies, calling his rhetoric hateful. After being detained for 104 days and released by a judge, Khalil faces new charges but vows to continue his activism and hold officials accountable. The case highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding free speech and pro-Palestinian movements.</p>

          <p>Search and rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have claimed at least 121 lives, with over 170 people still missing. The disaster, which primarily struck Kerr County, prompted a federal disaster declaration to support local efforts. A significant number of victims were from a girls' summer camp that was inundated when the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. The tragedy has intensified scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and the lack of a public alert system in the flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>Tesla has formally applied to test and operate its Robotaxi service in the Phoenix metropolitan area, a market where competitor Waymo has been established since 2020. The application covers operations with and without human safety drivers, marking a significant expansion of its autonomous vehicle ambitions beyond its current pilot program in Austin, Texas. This move underscores Tesla's strategy to catch up in the autonomous ride-hailing space using its camera-based system. The decision on the application is anticipated by the end of July.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and France have agreed to a new pilot program to manage illegal migration across the English Channel, set to begin within weeks. Under the "one in, one out" deal, the UK will return some migrants who arrive in small boats to France, and in exchange, will accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers through a formal process. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the plan aims to break the business model of people smugglers and deter dangerous crossings. Critics, however, argue the scheme is insufficient and will not have a significant deterrent effect.</p>

          <h2>DHS Ends Mandatory Shoe Removal at Airport Security, Sparking Analysis of the Policy's Legacy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an end to the two-decade-old requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes at security checkpoints. The policy was enacted after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001 and became a symbol of post-9/11 security measures. An analysis in The Atlantic frames the reversal not as a result of technological advancement but as "populism theater," giving the public a convenience previously reserved for those in premium programs like TSA PreCheck. The article reflects on how the ritual became an accepted, if burdensome, part of the travel experience for a generation.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can move forward to trial. Lemon sued for breach of contract after X abruptly canceled a partnership for his new show just hours after he conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's legal team had plausibly alleged claims of "fraud by false promise" and the existence of an implied contract. Musk's attempts to have the case moved or dismissed were denied.</p>

Officials in Brasilia are wary of direct retaliation that could harm their own industries, which rely on U.S. parts and machinery. Instead, they are considering actions permitted under Brazil's Reciprocity Law, such as suspending U.S. patents or taxing American corporate profits.
