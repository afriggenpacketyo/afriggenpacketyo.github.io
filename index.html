          <p>A vehicle deliberately struck a crowd waiting outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 36 people, with several in critical condition. The incident, which police are investigating as an intentional act, occurred early Saturday morning. The driver made a U-turn before accelerating into the line of people. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly attacked the driver, who was later found to have been shot by an unknown suspect who fled the scene. The driver is now in custody and undergoing surgery for his injuries.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the brother of the late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, has been arrested on suspicion of arson. The arrest followed an incident where a car crashed into a San Jose post office, causing the building to catch fire. Federal postal investigators are looking into the matter, including reports of spray-painted words on the building and claims the driver live-streamed the event. Richard Tillman, 44, was booked into Santa Clara County Jail, and the motive remains unclear.</p>

          <h2>GLP-1 Weight Loss Drugs Show Promise as a Potential Treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new class of weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy, is showing potential for treating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients in trials and anecdotal reports have experienced significant symptom improvement, including weight loss, hair regrowth, and the return of regular menstrual cycles. While more research is needed and insurance coverage remains a major obstacle, health experts are optimistic. The drugs appear to work by improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn can help regulate hormone levels associated with PCOS.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner Komeito, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament. The defeat reflects public dissatisfaction with inflation, political scandals, and rising anti-immigration sentiment. Despite the setback, which typically leads to a resignation, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to manage critical trade negotiations with the United States. The election also saw a significant surge for the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which gained momentum with its "Japanese First" platform.</p>

This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its citizens to a foreign country.

He described the practice as exploitative, suggesting that major corporations are profiting immensely from child labor without providing fair, long-term payment.

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's recent victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since the peak of Tiger Woods' career. Winning his fourth major, Scheffler is drawing frequent comparisons to Woods for his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments. While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his peers and commentators note his "Tiger-like" command of the sport. Key to his recent success has been a significant improvement in his putting after working with a new coach, transforming a previous weakness into a formidable strength.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to close the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD). This office is responsible for the scientific analysis that underpins environmental regulations concerning toxic chemicals, climate change, and pollution. The move is part of a broader plan to cut the EPA's staff by 23%, which the administration says will save money and allow the agency to better focus on its core mission. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, warning it will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health.</p>

          <p>Chris Martin, the frontman for Coldplay, humorously warned concertgoers to be ready for their close-up before the band performed its "Jumbotron Song." The warning comes after a recent show where the camera focused on a man and woman who appeared to be having an affair, a moment that quickly went viral online. The two individuals were later identified as the CEO and chief people officer of the tech company Astronomer, leading to the CEO's resignation. Martin's lighthearted notice at a subsequent concert seemed to be a direct acknowledgment of the widely publicized incident.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection." This refers to the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which is foundational for resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of their child's personality, and model their own emotional awareness and regulation.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the current environment for American businesses in China as a tightrope walk. In an interview, he notes that while an extension of the 90-day tariff pause is likely, the focus of bilateral talks has been almost exclusively on tariffs, neglecting other critical business issues. Stein suggests that China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors could open a path to de-escalation if the U.S. reciprocates by lowering related tariffs. However, the business community remains worried about the lack of broader dialogue and the ongoing uncertainty in the trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A non-profit founded by tech entrepreneur Adam Miller, called Better Angels, is aiming to prove that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer money. The organization is bidding on several large projects in Los Angeles, proposing to use a $300-million investment fund to provide equity and secure conventional loans, bypassing the slow and costly public subsidy system. By simplifying the financing, the model aims to build housing faster and at a fraction of the typical cost. The goal is to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing market, thereby accelerating solutions to the housing crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of plea deals for the accused 9/11 plotters, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, has plunged the long-delayed case into further uncertainty. The deals would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for guilty pleas and life sentences. According to legal expert Steve Vladeck, this development not only eliminates the most expedient path to a resolution but will also trigger more litigation over the way the deals were overruled. With the case now likely returning to years of pre-trial hearings, the prospect of achieving any form of legal closure for the nearly 25-year-old attacks seems more remote than ever.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being violently pulled into a running MRI machine by a heavy metal necklace he was wearing. The incident occurred at a medical facility on New York's Long Island when the man entered the MRI room without permission. The powerful magnetic field of the machine attracted the necklace, causing what police described as a "medical episode." The victim's wife stated he was wearing a 20-pound chain used for weight training and that she had asked him to enter the room to help her up after her scan.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Australia is potentially sabotaging its own efforts to stabilize its relationship with China. While Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China was framed positively by Chinese media, his government's stance on the potential forced sale of the Chinese-leased Darwin Port sends a conflicting message. The author contends that such actions undermine attempts to reassure Chinese investors that Australia is a reliable partner. This contradiction highlights the difficulty Canberra faces in balancing its national security concerns with its economic and diplomatic relationship with Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>
