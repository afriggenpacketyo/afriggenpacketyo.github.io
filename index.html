          <p>Former Disney star Christy Carlson Romano described a harrowing incident where she was struck by birdshot during a clay pigeon shooting outing with her husband. Romano, who was hit in multiple places including below her eye, emphasized the importance of gun safety while recounting the event. She revealed that a fragment is still lodged behind her eye, dangerously close to causing blindness, and another fragment remains in her forehead. Despite the severity, Romano initially made jokes to keep those around her calm, though she admitted to struggling with the reality of being a "gunshot survivor."</p>

          <p>Victoria McCloud, a trans former judge, argues that the Supreme Court's ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance about shared public spaces, puts trans people at risk. McCloud fears that the ruling, defining a woman by biological sex under equalities law, could lead to violence against trans individuals, particularly in gendered spaces like restrooms. She is planning to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the court did not hear from trans people before its decision.

          <p>Thousands of Chinese officials are rushing to adhere to President Xi Jinping's austerity orders, ensuring modest offices and proper meal receipts, as inspectors conduct checks. This campaign, ongoing since 2012, targets overspending among Communist Party and government bodies to improve the party's image and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest this also ensures wise spending amid rivalry with the U.S. and identifies politically loyal cadres for promotion. The effectiveness of the campaign is questioned due to strict media control and the difficulty of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>
