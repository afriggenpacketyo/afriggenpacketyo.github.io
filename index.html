          <p>This article discusses the heightened anxiety among American Jews following several recent attacks. The attack in Colorado on a march for Israeli hostages has contributed to a sense that simply existing in public as a Jewish person is increasingly dangerous. This follows other incidents, such as the shooting of Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C., raising concerns about antisemitism and safety within the Jewish community. The article highlights the need for increased security measures and community support to address these fears.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic published an analysis of the recent attacks in Boulder, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., targeting Jewish individuals, describing them as acts of "performative intimacy." The attacks are characterized by their specific targeting of Jewish people, intending to inflict horror on the community and imply that no Jew could be innocent. The analysis argues that this form of terrorism seeks to create a spectacle that makes all Jewish Americans feel vulnerable. The solution lies in delegitimizing these acts without qualification and maintaining a strong distinction between what Israel does and who Jews are.</p>

          <p>A federal jury convicted Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy Trevor Kirk of using excessive force, but the case took a controversial turn when the new U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli requested to dismiss the felony charge.

Essayli's actions, including involving the Riverside County district attorney's office, have been questioned, with some suggesting political motivations behind the handling of the case.
