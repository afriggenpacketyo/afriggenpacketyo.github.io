          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of false statements and obstruction related to his 2020 Senate testimony, with his legal team planning to challenge the lawfulness of the appointment of the U.S. Attorney leading the case. Comey's attorneys plan to file a motion challenging the lawfulness of Halligan's appointment, but that will be heard by a different judge appointed by the chief judge of 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The defense argues the case is simple, while the government anticipates classified information involvement, leading to potential delays, with Comey denying any wrongdoing and expressing eagerness for a trial. The judge set a trial date for January 5, expressing a desire for a speedy trial, and the defense plans to challenge the grand jury proceedings, citing government misconduct. </p>

          <p>With national credit card debt reaching record levels, this article outlines four strategies for managing debt exceeding $10,000. Options include working with a credit counseling agency to negotiate lower interest rates, utilizing a debt consolidation loan to replace multiple high-rate cards with a single, fixed-rate loan, and considering a 0% balance transfer card for a promotional period. A more aggressive approach involves settling debts for less than the full amount owed, which can negatively impact credit (not investment advice). The article emphasizes taking prompt action to explore available support and conquer debt effectively. </p>

          <p>UEFA is exploring streaming rights to potentially raise over £4 billion annually from its next TV deals, benefiting top European clubs. The governing body believes the next broadcast rights sale for Champions League, Europa League, and Europa Conference League games could bring in a minimum of €5 billion annually, with new deals taking effect from 2027. One first-pick game per round could be shown by a streaming service, such as Amazon, Disney, or Netflix, and broadcasters will be able to bid for rights in multiple markets simultaneously. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin addressed clubs, emphasizing the ambition to deliver engaging football, innovate accessibility, and expand revenue streams through digital platforms. </p>

          <p>Sno Pac Foods is voluntarily recalling two types of organic frozen spinach distributed nationwide due to potential Listeria contamination. The FDA warns that Listeria can cause serious infections, especially in vulnerable populations like young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems, and can also lead to miscarriages and stillbirths. Consumers are advised to dispose of or return the recalled products for a refund, with the company suspending production while investigating the source of the contamination. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection to the recalled spinach. </p>

          <p>California's plan to redraw congressional maps mid-decade is a central issue in the 2026 gubernatorial race, with candidates divided on Proposition 50, which would authorize lawmakers to redraw districts. Democratic candidates generally support the measure, arguing it counters Republican gerrymandering efforts, while some expressed unease with the partisan nature of the proposal.

          <p>A report from Public Citizen and the Revolving Door Project reveals that over 40 individuals with direct ties to oil, gas, and coal companies have been appointed to the Trump administration, influencing energy and environmental policies. The analysis identifies 111 employees as "fossil fuel insiders and renewable energy opponents," including senior officials and those with connections to fossil fuel-funded think tanks. Critics argue that these appointments demonstrate the administration's prioritization of specific moneyed interests and a disastrous deregulatory agenda. The White House and Energy Department defended the appointments, emphasizing the administration's focus on American energy potential and lower energy prices. </p>

          <p>This article examines the reasons behind the failure of England's 'Golden Generation' of footballers to achieve major tournament success, citing tactical shortcomings, club rivalries, and superior opponents. Former captain Steven Gerrard attributed their failures to being "egotistical losers" and a lack of team unity, while others pointed to the rigid 4-4-2 formation employed by managers. The article also highlights the injury problems and psychological pressure faced by key players, as well as the disruptive influence of the WAG culture and the boredom experienced during tournament camps.

Other research indicates that older Americans are still more likely to participate in religious services monthly when considering the entire U.S. population, and the share of Gen Z Americans attending church remains low.

          <p>The German government has increased its economic growth forecasts, now expecting 0.2% growth in 2025 and 1.3% in 2026, up from previous projections of zero and 1%, respectively. The government anticipates a low-level recovery by autumn 2025, driven by state financing, particularly from special funds for infrastructural investments and increased investment in defense. However, the projections have faced criticism for relying on public debt. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche emphasized the need to lower energy prices and taxes to spur further growth. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump called for the imprisonment of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, accusing them of failing to protect US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. This comes as National Guard troops have begun arriving in the Chicago area at the order of the Trump administration, despite objections from Illinois officials. Johnson and Pritzker responded, accusing Trump of authoritarianism and using troops as "political props." A court hearing is scheduled on a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment of the National Guard to the city. </p>

          <p>Despite renewed UN sanctions, Iran continues to export crude oil by circumventing international restrictions through a shadow financial and shipping network. The US government has targeted over 115 individuals, companies, and ships linked to the Iranian oil industry. China remains the largest buyer of Iranian oil, establishing a clandestine barter system where oil is exchanged for infrastructure projects. This arrangement has provided Iran with much-needed revenue, bypassing the international banking system and mitigating the impact of sanctions. </p>

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) includes changes to capital gains taxes that may benefit business founders and early employee wealth, particularly through revisions to the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption. The bill expands the QSBS exemption to $15 million for stock acquired after July 4, 2025, and introduces a tiered exclusion system allowing for earlier sales of stock without forfeiting all tax benefits. This may incentivize entrepreneurs to organize startups as C corporations and attract outside investors. The rules also increase the limit on gross assets of a C corp to $75 million for QSBS eligibility (not investment advice). </p>

Trump fired Comey in May 2017, drawing anger from Trump in the first months of his first term in office. The case against Comey, who is a prominent critic of Trump, is widely seen as an attempt by the president to seek legal retribution against political opponents. </p>

          <p>Paramount Chairman and Chief Executive David Ellison is championing “Red Alert,” a four-part scripted drama portraying the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, which debuted on Paramount+. Since assuming control of Paramount, Ellison has moved to position the company slightly right of the political center, while also taking on polarizing issues. The company said it disagreed with the Film Workers call to avoid film screenings or to work with Israeli film institutions. The employee group, which calls itself Paramount Employees of Conscience, said they have sent two letters to Paramount leaders in the last month to voice their concerns but have not received a reply. </p>
