          <p>An explosion at a construction site in Tokyo on Tuesday slightly injured ten people. Police suspect a gas leak from a damaged pipe during foundation work triggered the incident. The victims, ranging in age from their 20s to 70s, included construction workers and nearby residents, some complaining of sore throats from smoke inhalation. The blast caused damage to windows and shutters of adjacent buildings, prompting an emergency call reporting the sound of an explosion around 9:35 a.m.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer, aiming to alleviate the impact of inflation. This measure is part of a broader relief package designed to counter the adverse economic effects of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, which include a 25 percent levy on automobiles that significantly affects Japan's car industry.

Zhang Zhiwei from Pinpoint Asset Management noted that this trend aligns with improved export figures for April, but the outlook for the second half of the year remains uncertain due to the unclear trade relationship between China and the US.

          <p>Hong Kong is actively working to become an international data-trading hub by strengthening connections with mainland China and Southeast Asia, according to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po. Cross-border data sharing is seen as a key driver of an AI-driven economy, benefiting both people and businesses. The government's open data portal offers over 5,600 data sets, with more than 60 billion downloads recorded in 2024. The Commercial Data Interchange, launched in 2022, has processed over 20 million data exchanges, facilitating faster credit assessments for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

          <p>A leaked recording reveals that a senior police officer had reservations about the arrest of Nicola Packer, who took abortion pills when she was about 26 weeks pregnant, believing she was only six weeks along. The recording from a 2020 meeting includes the Met's child abuse investigation lead stating that it is not a comfortable area for police to be operating in, referring to any criminalization around abortions. Packer was arrested after delivering a stillborn baby at home and was later acquitted of having an illegal abortion. The midwife who initially called the police is also heard in the recording.</p>

The MTR Corporation, which is nearly 75% government-owned, was fined HK$19.2 million following its third disruption in four months due to technical failure.

          <p>Australian wheat inventories are expected to be significantly higher than last year due to reduced imports from China and competition from Russia, potentially leading to lower prices. Australia's wheat exports to China have decreased substantially compared to previous seasons, while Russian wheat exports remain strong. Analysts predict a large carryover of wheat, potentially forcing a fire sale before the new harvest, which could drive prices down. The situation is compounded by abundant global supply, creating storage capacity issues and pressuring farmers to sell at lower prices. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Håkan Samuelsson cited the "challenging period" as the reason for the layoffs, which represent about 15% of its white collar workforce.

          <p>China faces a significant risk of job losses due to ongoing trade tensions with the United States, particularly in the manufacturing sector. A chronic housing slowdown and high youth unemployment rate have made China more vulnerable than it was during President Trump's first term. A research report from Natixis indicates that sustained tariffs could lead to a loss of up to six million manufacturing jobs, with the potential for nine million losses if the trade war escalates. This comes as China struggles to recover from the pandemic and faces challenges in its labor market, especially among young workers. (not investment advice)</p>
