        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, have filed to dismiss the federal indictment that makes him eligible for the death penalty. The defense argues that a 'torrent of prejudice' from public officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, has violated his constitutional rights and made a fair trial impossible. They specifically cited a televised 'dehumanizing' perp walk and politically charged public statements as evidence that the capital punishment decision was based on politics, not merit. This legal challenge comes as a state judge separately dismissed two terrorism-related murder charges against Mangione, though other serious state charges remain.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, "Softly, as I Leave You," Priscilla Presley provides a harrowing account of the day Elvis Presley died on August 16, 1977. She describes the frantic phone call she received, her immediate flight to Graceland, and the surreal atmosphere inside the home as family and friends grappled with the news. Presley details the difficult task of comforting their young daughter, Lisa Marie, who had seen her father's body, and the overwhelming experience of the nationally televised funeral. The excerpt reflects on the profound and lasting emptiness she felt, realizing a significant part of her life had ended with his passing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study from China's Helicopter Research and Development Institute details a new artificial intelligence system reportedly capable of detecting even the stealthiest submarines with 95% accuracy in simulations. The system works by evaluating diverse data sources like sonar buoys, water temperature, and salinity in real-time to create a dynamic underwater map and provide simple action points for military personnel. While this technology could potentially undermine the effectiveness of submarine-based nuclear deterrents, Western military experts express skepticism, viewing the announcement partly as psychological warfare. They note the extreme complexity of the underwater environment and the ongoing arms race between detection and stealth technologies make such a system difficult to implement effectively.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally chaotic qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, saw numerous drivers crash on the difficult street circuit, including championship contender Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the final segment. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, having set a fast time early, while Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson secured a surprise third position. The frequent interruptions and light rain created unpredictable conditions, challenging drivers and strategists throughout the dramatic qualifying event in Baku.</p>

          <p>West Ham head coach Graham Potter is facing significant internal scrutiny, with the club reportedly considering potential replacements following a poor start to the season. The pressure intensified after a recent home defeat to Crystal Palace, marking their fourth loss in five Premier League games. Sources indicate that even before this loss, the club had begun identifying alternatives, with names like Nuno Espirito Santo and former manager Slaven Bilic being discussed. Despite the disappointing results and fan frustration, Potter has stated he has no reason to believe he has lost the board's support and remains focused on working with the players to improve performance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clinched their 13th straight playoff berth following a 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The win ties the second-longest postseason streak in MLB history and occurred during what was pitcher Clayton Kershaw's final regular-season home game of his career, as he recently announced his retirement. Kershaw, a franchise legend, received a no-decision after pitching 4.1 innings in the pivotal game. While the Dodgers have secured a spot in the postseason, they have not yet clinched the NL West division title, remaining focused on that next objective before turning their attention to the playoffs.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has implemented new media restrictions that require journalists to sign a pledge agreeing not to gather any information, including unclassified documents, that has not been officially authorized for release. Refusal to sign will result in the revocation of their press credentials, a move that severely limits reporters' ability to move freely within the building and access materials. Press freedom advocates have condemned the policy as a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint on publication. This follows other recent restrictions on media access at the Pentagon under the Trump administration, which has maintained a hostile stance toward many major news organizations.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving what a venue described as a 'credible threat' on his life. The threat was reportedly made online by a 26-year-old man in Ottawa, Canada, prior to a festival performance, and the individual has since been charged. Out of caution for the safety of the artist and his band, Morrissey's scheduled performances at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut and Boston's MGM Music Hall were called off.

The discussion highlighted a pattern of actions by the administration aimed at controlling narratives and punishing critical voices in the media.

The author contends that technology, design, and art are increasingly spartan and unobtrusive, comparing the aesthetic to a beige, joyless restaurant. This trend is contrasted with the colorful, maximalist designs of past technology like the 1998 iMac, which celebrated boldness and personality. The author suggests this modern minimalism is a form of control and a dishonest reflection of a chaotic world, stripping stories and objects of the context and richness that give them meaning.</p>

Critics, including political scientists and Democratic lawmakers, warn that this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, using a tragedy as a pretext to crush dissent, erode free speech, and delegitimize mainstream political opposition.

This article analyzes how Kirk's own political evolution mirrored the rise of Trump-era Christian nationalism, shifting from secular free-market advocacy to embracing a strident Christian culture war. Religious leaders aligned with the movement have used his death to issue a 'battle cry,' suggesting it will embolden their fight against what they see as evil and demonic leftist beliefs. This reframing leverages the tragedy to energize a political-religious base that has become increasingly influential in conservative politics.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials report that a massive overnight Russian missile and drone attack across nine regions has killed at least three people and wounded more than 30. President Zelenskyy described the assault as a deliberate strategy to intimidate civilians, noting that a missile with cluster munitions directly hit a residential building in the city of Dnipro. Ukraine's air force stated that Russia launched 619 projectiles, while Russia's defense ministry claimed its 'massive strike' targeted military-industrial facilities. In a separate incident, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck a major oil refinery in Russia's Samara region, where local officials reported four deaths.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including three teenagers, have been arrested in Renton, Washington, in connection with an alleged hate crime attack that left a 39-year-old transgender woman hospitalized with serious injuries. According to police, the suspects argued with the victim before chasing her down, knocking her to the ground, and repeatedly assaulting her while shouting homophobic and transphobic slurs. A witness video reportedly captured the group violently punching and kicking the victim in her head and upper body. The adult suspect turned himself in after being identified, while the three teenagers were also taken into custody, facing charges including assault and a hate crime.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indices achieved multiple record highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point.

The move was highly anticipated by investors, who reacted positively, pushing the major indices to significant weekly gains.

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to stop U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising new 'golden share' rights. These rights were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of the company by Japan's Nippon Steel, granting the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After U.S. Steel informed nearly 800 workers of an impending closure, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly warned the company the administration would not permit it, prompting a reversal. This marks the first use of these national-security-related powers, highlighting the administration's increasing direct involvement in the private sector.</p>

Lewinsky discussed how younger generations have re-evaluated her story with more empathy, recognizing the power imbalance at play. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story, healing from past trauma, and finding humor in oneself as essential tools for survival and reclaiming one's identity.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked cautious optimism for more stable bilateral relations. Following what both sides described as a productive conversation, Trump announced plans for the two leaders to meet at the upcoming APEC summit and for him to visit China early next year. The discussion covered key issues including trade frictions and the control of TikTok. Despite the positive signals, analysts remain wary, pointing to significant sources of friction such as tensions in the Taiwan Strait and potential U.S. tariffs over China's purchase of Russian oil that could undermine the momentum.</p>

          <p>This analysis notes that the United States has become significantly quieter about publicizing its naval warship transits through the Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. While such operations were regularly announced under the previous administration as a show of support for freedom of navigation, there have been only three known transits this year, all confirmed only after media inquiries. Beijing has historically criticized the 'public hype' surrounding these maneuvers. Some Chinese observers view this shift as a tactical change by the U.S. rather than a substantive alteration of its policy, aimed at reducing direct public confrontation without ceasing the operations themselves.</p>

Data shows a steady increase in U.S. students studying abroad, with consultants reporting a surge in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the primary motivation is financial, as tuition in many European countries is significantly lower than in the U.S., allowing them to avoid substantial student debt. For others, concerns about the domestic political landscape and a desire for an international perspective are driving their decision to pursue degrees overseas.</p>

          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Adam Friedman, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate the skin more deeply and are associated with accelerated skin aging and skin cancer. This 'silent' exposure can occur without any visible sign like a burn, as UVA rays can also pass through clouds. To stay protected, Dr. Friedman recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially if spending extended periods near windows, and reapplying every two hours if outdoors.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing increasingly expensive grocery bills, with food prices rising at their fastest monthly rate in years. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change, and a shortage of agricultural labor. Tariffs have increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production to other countries. Additionally, immigration policies and a lack of interest in farm work have created a labor deficit, all of which contribute to higher costs that are ultimately passed on to shoppers.</p>
