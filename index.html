          <p>This article explores the historical advantage of left-handed tennis players, noting their past dominance at the US Open and their ability to confound right-handed opponents with unique ball trajectories and spins. After a long period of right-handed champions, a "lefty renaissance" appears underway with rising stars like Ben Shelton and Jack Draper showing strong form. Their powerful serves and all-around play could challenge the sport's current top players and potentially lead to a left-handed Grand Slam winner soon.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled concerns about a cooling U.S. labor market, hinting at potential interest rate cuts for the first time in nearly a year. This follows a significant slowdown in job growth and weaker payroll gains, alarming experts who anticipate further pain for job seekers. Red flags include fewer hires, a surge in long-term job seekers, and increased unemployment among young workers. The article suggests that while the overall unemployment rate remains low, these forward-looking indicators point to a more pessimistic outlook for the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that the Trump administration's interference, including communication freezes and staff layoffs, hampered the CDC's response to a measles outbreak in Texas, leading to its widespread and deadly impact. CDC scientists felt restrained from openly communicating with local health workers, delaying critical support for communities struggling with undervaccinated populations. The situation was exacerbated by misinformation about vaccines and the promotion of unproven treatments, highlighting the dangers of political manipulation in public health during a crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated federal funding for California's Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), citing concerns over the program's inclusion of "radical gender ideology" that allegedly contradicts biological reality and statutory requirements. The administration asserts that California's "Teen Talk" curriculum promotes harmful concepts to impressionable youth, including gender transition procedures, without parental consent. Despite California's defense of its materials as "medically accurate," the Department of Health and Human Services vowed to review all state PREP curricula to ensure compliance with federal law, threatening to cut funding for noncompliant states.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks the popular fitness trend of weighted vests, which social media influencers claim offer benefits for posture, weight loss, and bone/muscle growth. While experts acknowledge potential cardiovascular benefits and increased calorie burn, research does not strongly support claims of improved bone density or significant muscle strength. Weight-bearing exercises like resistance training are cited as more effective for strength building. Ultimately, if a weighted vest motivates physical activity, it can be beneficial, but it should not replace proven strength-building methods.</p>

          <p>The UK is anticipating temperatures up to 30C on bank holiday Monday, with potential record highs in some areas, before a significant shift to blustery winds and rain. The change is attributed to the remnants of Hurricane Erin, expected to bring wet weather across most of the UK. This comes after a summer already marked by heatwaves and dry periods, leading to water shortfalls and concerns for harvests. Travel disruptions are also expected due to strikes and engineering works, affecting bank holiday plans.</p>

While job vacancies are falling and growth is slowing, initial jobless claims remain low, indicating a cautious but stable holding pattern. (not investment advice)</p>
