          <h2>Bitcoin Price Surges Amid Relief Rally Following Trump's Comments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 13:08:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant surge, rising for the third consecutive day, driven by a relief rally after President Trump softened his stance on China tariffs and reduced his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency's price increased by over 2%, reaching levels not seen since early March, recovering more than half of its losses since Inauguration Day. Market strategists attribute the surge to investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing reported narrowed losses in the first quarter and is preparing to seek FAA approval to increase production of its 737 Max jets.

Despite concerns about global trade developments, Boeing maintains a strong backlog worth over $500 billion, reflecting robust demand for its aircraft.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of St. Louis, Missouri, are experiencing a high incidence of cancer due to decades of exposure to nuclear waste dumped near Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River. The waste originated from uranium production during the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, with the leftovers improperly disposed of in various locations throughout the city. A 2019 study indicated that those who lived near Coldwater Creek between the 1960s and 1990s faced a higher risk of developing lung cancer, bone cancer, or leukemia. Local doctors have observed a concerning number of young patients developing significant cancers in areas near the contaminated creek.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, the Supreme Court issued an order preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan nationals under the Alien Enemies Act, signaling strong disapproval of the administration's disregard for legal procedures and judicial directives. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in upholding the rule of law when executive actions are perceived as overreaching. A Court of Appeals judge emphasized the government's assertion of a right to detain residents in foreign prisons without due process, raising fundamental constitutional concerns. The case draws parallels to the desegregation efforts of American schools, providing a historical context for the current judicial challenge.</p>

          <p>The U.S. personal protective equipment (PPE) industry, devastated by cheap Chinese imports, faces continued challenges despite President Trump's tariffs on China. While intended to bolster domestic manufacturing, the tariffs have created unease among remaining U.S. PPE producers. The industry's decline had severe consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic when China halted exports, leaving American healthcare workers vulnerable. Some fear the tariffs may not be a responsible industrial policy and could further destabilize the industry, rather than ensuring independence from China.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that blood tests could predict the return of skin cancer by examining levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The research found that approximately 80% of stage 3 melanoma patients with detectable ctDNA experienced a recurrence of the cancer. Early detection of the disease's return through ctDNA analysis could save lives, as melanoma is notoriously difficult to treat once it has spread. Researchers plan to improve the sensitivity of the tests to further reduce recurrence cases.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to a level between 50% and 65%, according to The Wall Street Journal. The move could de-escalate the trade war between the U.S. and China, which has roiled global markets. The White House is reviewing options, including a tiered system that differentiates between strategic and non-strategic goods, with lower tariffs for the latter. The decision follows Trump's statement that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would be reduced from the current 145%.</p>
