          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of Trump Mobile, a cellular phone plan costing $47.45 per month, offering unlimited talk, text, and data, along with roadside assistance and telehealth benefits. The company also plans to sell a "T1" smartphone, priced at $499, featuring a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag. This venture follows Trump's pattern of capitalizing on his political career by licensing his name for various products, such as watches and sneakers. The plan's name, "The 47 Plan," and its price are references to Trump's current term as the 47th U.S. president. The new phone will have Trump's campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again."

          <p>The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission, consisting of two spacecraft flying in precise formation, has achieved a groundbreaking observation of the sun's corona by creating an artificial solar eclipse. The mission involves two spacecraft flying 150 meters apart, with one casting a shadow over the other to block the sun's light. This allows scientists to study the solar corona, the sun's outer atmosphere, closer to the solar rim than ever before. Scientists hope to unravel mysteries such as why the corona is much hotter than the sun's surface and to improve understanding of solar weather, which can affect telecommunications satellites and power grids on Earth. </p>

          <p>French authorities have closed the stalls of five Israeli defense firms at the Paris Air Show, citing a ban on "offensive weapons" displays amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The decision has been condemned by Israel as "outrageous and unprecedented," with Israeli President Isaac Herzog calling for the situation to be immediately corrected. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision, stating that France could not accept offensive weapons being displayed given concerns about Gaza. The closure has cast a shadow over the event, which is also grappling with the aftermath of a recent Air India crash and Boeing's decision to focus on support rather than sales.</p>

          <p>Savings experts are weighing in on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) term to consider ahead of potential interest rate cuts. Short-term CDs may be best for those looking to maximize returns, while long-term CDs offer security and predictability. A CD ladder strategy, combining short-term and long-term CDs, provides flexibility and access to cash at regular intervals. Savers should shop around and understand early withdrawal penalties before opening a CD account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Louvre in Paris unexpectedly closed as staff protested unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing, and difficult working conditions. The strike erupted during an internal meeting, with gallery attendants, ticket agents, and security personnel refusing to work. The closure highlights the impact of global overtourism on the museum, which welcomes 8.7 million visitors annually. President Macron's plan to address the issues, including a new room for the Mona Lisa and a new entrance, is underway, but workers say the changes are needed now. </p>

          <p>A massive great white shark, named "Contender," has resurfaced off the coast of North Carolina, providing valuable data on the lives of white sharks in the Northwest Atlantic. Contender, nearly 14 feet long and weighing 1,653 pounds, was tagged by OCEARCH scientists in January off the Florida-Georgia coast. The shark's reappearance coincides with the time of year when great white sharks migrate north to warmer waters for a larger food supply. The OCEARCH Global Shark Tracker App allows users to follow Contender and other tagged sharks online.</p>
