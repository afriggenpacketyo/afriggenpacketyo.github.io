        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved Qamzova, a non-opioid painkiller invented in China, as a potential alternative to addictive opioids like fentanyl. Developed by Delova, Qamzova is a long-acting injectable analgesic providing 24-hour pain relief with a single daily injection. Clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing post-surgical reliance on opioids. This approval marks a significant milestone for China's pharmaceutical industry and offers healthcare professionals a tool to mitigate opioid dependency risks in the US, directly addressing the fentanyl-fueled overdose epidemic. The medication contains a high concentration of meloxicam, a compound commonly used to reduce pain and inflammation.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has criticized the Trump administration's decision to ban international students from Harvard, arguing it will damage America's international standing. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated that educational cooperation with the US is mutually beneficial and opposes its politicization. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology extended an open invitation to international students affected by the ban, offering streamlined admission procedures. This move comes amid rising tensions between the US and China regarding student visas and increasing concerns among Chinese students about safety and policy uncertainty in the United States.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical gas and electricity bill decreasing by Â£11 a month starting in July. Ofgem advises households to shop around for fixed energy deals, potentially saving up to Â£200 annually, as fixed deals may offer better value than the variable tariffs affected by the price cap. The drop reflects a decrease in international wholesale gas prices, but energy bills remain high, with many customers still struggling with costs. The regulator is also considering changes to standing charges, which cover the cost of connecting to an energy supply.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread protests and calls for reform following George Floyd's murder, a New York Times article indicates surprisingly little has changed in policing nationwide. While states and cities enacted new policies such as banning chokeholds and mandating body cameras, data suggests minimal impact on accountability or police killings. Killings by police officers have actually risen since 2019. The article cites waning interest in reform after a rise in murder rates, and deeper problems such as racial disparities and higher crime rates in minority communities as reasons for the lack of progress.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction, pausing President Trump's sweeping overhaul of the federal government indefinitely. The judge sided with a coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments, arguing that Trump lacks the authority to carry out such a radical transformation without Congressional approval. The order prevents agencies from issuing new reorganization plans and layoff notices, although it does not require agencies to rehire those already laid off. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems insufficient. The BMA argues that doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago when accounting for inflation. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) may dispute the government if it doesn't fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers. The Health Secretary defends the offers as above inflation, but unions are concerned about the impact on services and potential job losses.</p>

          <p>Local governments in China will now be required to justify significant increases in fines and charges levied on private companies. This order from Beijing aims to eliminate arbitrary fines, unlawful enforcement, and profit-driven behavior targeting private enterprises. The initiative is part of the central government's economic recovery efforts and focuses on detecting unusual increases in punitive fees through real-time statistical analysis of enforcement activity. The Ministry of Justice emphasizes the importance of truly correcting these issues for the campaign's success.</p>

          <p>In response to perceived limitations on transparency from the Trump administration, independent record-keepers have established databases to archive public data and documentation. These archives include the American Presidency Project, Data.gov Archive, Data Rescue Project, Factba.se, Federal Environmental Web Tracker, Internet Archive, Rev, and Trump's Truth. These projects aim to ensure public access to government records and fact-checking resources. However, transparency advocates remain concerned about information that may never be made public.</p>

          <p>Matt K. Lewis argues that the scandal surrounding Joe Biden's declining fitness isn't a shocking revelation, but rather the fact that it was overlooked by many elites. Despite Biden's inability to communicate effectively, his inner circle and the media downplayed his condition, prioritizing loyalty and fear of what would come next. The author suggests that the truth was hidden in plain sight, with collective inertia and a focus on more dramatic figures like Trump contributing to the lack of attention.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a national school voucher program, offering tax credits for donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs) that fund private school tuition. The plan would reward donors with dollar-for-dollar tax credits, potentially leading to personal profit and making it a tax shelter for the wealthy. Vouchers would be available to households earning up to 300% of an area's median income, but unlike public schools, private schools can turn students away, including those with disabilities. Research suggests vouchers don't improve student test scores, but may increase college attendance.</p>
