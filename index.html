          <p>The suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was apprehended after a 33-hour manhunt. His father recognized him from photos and, after a tense conversation, contacted a youth pastor who is also a U.S. Marshals task force officer, leading to the arrest. Investigators uncovered messages from Robinson discussing a rifle and found casings at the scene with engraved anti-fascist and taunting messages. Authorities believe Robinson, who was not a student at Utah Valley University, had become more political recently and had expressed dislike for Kirk's views.</p>

Swift's lawyer stated that the singer has no material role in the case and would only comply if compelled by the court, noting her schedule could only accommodate it in late October. Lively's attorney accused Baldoni's team of trying to involve Swift to create a media spectacle, arguing there is no valid reason to extend the discovery deadline to accommodate the deposition.</p>

          <p>At a recent technology conference, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised data analytics firm Palantir for its impressive market performance and investor appeal, calling himself "inspired" by the company. However, he also took a jab at its business model, describing Palantir's software as "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen" and joking that perhaps he isn't charging enough. The comments highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies, which occasionally compete for major government and enterprise contracts.</p>

          <p>An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez during a vehicle stop in Franklin Park, Illinois, after he allegedly resisted arrest and attempted to drive into the agents. According to officials, the suspect's vehicle struck and dragged one agent, who then discharged his firearm in fear for his life. The suspect was pronounced dead at a local hospital, while the injured agent was reported to be in stable condition.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed an agent on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance after he made a negative Facebook post about the recently assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The agent, Anthony Pough, wrote that Kirk had "spewed hate" and was facing "karma." In response, Secret Service Director Sean Curran sent a memo to all staff, reminding them of their duty to operate without political bias and warning that such public actions compromise the agency's mission and trust.</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled its plans to develop a fully battery-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing slowing demand for large EVs in the North American market. This marks a significant strategy shift for the automaker, which had already delayed the truck's launch twice. Instead of the all-electric model, the company will focus its efforts on launching an extended-range electric truck, previously known as the "Ramcharger," which will now be named the "Ram 1500 REV" and is expected next year.</p>

His mastery of social media and his focus on creating large-scale, celebrity-attended events built a powerful youth movement.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging that the ride-sharing giant systematically discriminates against passengers with disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit claims Uber drivers frequently deny service to individuals with service animals or mobility devices like wheelchairs, and sometimes charge improper fees. While Uber stated that it has a zero-tolerance policy for such discrimination and disagrees with the allegations, the DOJ is seeking a court order to force policy changes and monetary damages.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the Missouri state legislature have passed a new congressional map that is expected to add one seat to their party's U.S. House delegation. The redistricting plan, which now awaits the governor's signature, dismantles the district currently held by veteran Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver in the Kansas City area. This mid-decade redistricting is part of a national strategy pushed by President Trump to reshape electoral maps, while opponents have vowed to challenge the new boundaries with a statewide voter referendum.</p>

          <p>The European Commission will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 phase-out of new internal combustion engine cars, according to President Ursula von der Leyen. This move comes after intense lobbying from the European auto industry, which has cited significant challenges including high manufacturing costs, insufficient charging infrastructure, and strong competition from Chinese electric vehicle makers. Automakers are calling for a relaxation of the ban to allow for other technologies, such as hybrids, signaling a potential major shift in the EU's green transition strategy.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened tensions in Eastern Europe, Russia and its ally Belarus have started their large-scale joint military exercises, known as "Zapad 2025." These drills, held every four years, simulate a response to a potential conflict and are taking place in close proximity to the borders of NATO members Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania. The exercises have put neighboring countries on high alert, with Poland increasing its own military readiness in response, due to concerns that the drills could be a precursor to further Russian aggression in the region.</p>

The widespread unrest was initially ignited by a government decision to ban numerous social media platforms, which quickly escalated into a mass movement against the political establishment.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals upcoming interest rate cuts, a debate has emerged over what will happen to the record $7.6 trillion currently held in high-yield money market funds. Some on Wall Street theorize this "wall of cash" will flow into stocks and other riskier assets as yields on cash decrease, potentially fueling a market rally. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that a large portion of these funds is institutional cash that is unlikely to move, and that historically, money fund assets only shrink significantly when interest rates fall near zero.

          <p>With mortgage rates dropping to a near one-year low, this article provides four key reminders for potential homebuyers. It advises that timing is crucial, as rates can move in anticipation of Federal Reserve decisions, not just after. Buyers should also focus on improving their credit scores to qualify for the best possible rates. Furthermore, it suggests prioritizing finding the right home over waiting for even lower rates, as the perfect property may not remain available, and securing a pre-approval is still essential to making a competitive offer.

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, the imprisoned mayor of Istanbul and a leading political rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared in court Friday to face charges of falsifying his university degree. Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of up to eight years and a ban on political activity, which would effectively disqualify him from the 2028 presidential election. Imamoglu and his supporters maintain that the charges are politically motivated and absurd, designed solely to eliminate a popular opposition figure from the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The possibility of a U.S. government shutdown is growing as the September 30 funding deadline nears with no agreement in sight. Congressional Democratic leaders have declared they will not support any spending bills that fail to include their healthcare priorities, aiming to reverse recent Republican-led changes to federal programs. In response, President Trump has told Republicans to not even bother negotiating, creating a partisan standoff that makes a short-term funding extension the most likely, albeit temporary, solution to avoid a shutdown.</p>
