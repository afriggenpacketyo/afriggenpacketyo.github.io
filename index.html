          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a framework trade agreement. The meeting aims to prevent a threatened 30% tariff on EU goods, with sources suggesting a potential compromise of a 15% tariff. This diplomatic effort comes amid cautious optimism, drawing parallels to a recent U.S.-Japan trade deal, as both sides seek to maintain their massive bilateral trade relationship and avoid escalating a transatlantic trade war.

          <p>Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for his 50th birthday. The book reportedly contains a letter from Donald Trump, which he denies and is the subject of a defamation lawsuit he filed against the Wall Street Journal. Lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related documents.</p>

          <p>Pemiscot Memorial, a vital hospital in Missouri's poorest county, is on the brink of closure due to financial struggles, threatening healthcare access for a rural community. The situation is further imperiled by a new federal bill championed by President Trump that mandates historic cuts to Medicaid, a primary revenue source for the hospital. Despite local Republican lawmakers supporting the bill, hospital leaders and community members fear the cuts will devastate their already fragile healthcare system. This case highlights a growing crisis for rural hospitals nationwide.</p>

          <p>WWE icon Hulk Hogan, who passed away at age 71, had been transparent about his extensive health struggles in the years leading up to his death. He reportedly underwent 25 surgeries in a decade, including procedures on his back, shoulders, knees, and hips, which he attributed to the physical toll of his long wrestling career. His wife recently clarified he was recovering from a major neck surgery, dispelling rumors he was in a coma. Medical experts note that past steroid use and the physical strain common among wrestlers of his era contribute to a higher premature death rate.</p>

          <p>A new study from Keck Medicine of USC reveals a significant increase in advanced liver scarring among heavy drinkers in the U.S. over the last two decades, even though overall drinking rates have not risen. The prevalence of significant liver fibrosis jumped from 1.8% to 4.3% in this group, with women, older individuals, and people with metabolic conditions being particularly affected. Researchers suggest the changing health profile of drinkers, including higher rates of obesity and diabetes, may be a contributing factor to the increased liver damage.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's claim of targeting the "worst of the worst," a data analysis reveals a significant disparity in its Los Angeles immigration enforcement. In June, nearly 70% of immigrants arrested in the region had no criminal convictions, a sharp increase from previous months. This trend suggests that to meet aggressive arrest quotas, enforcement has shifted from focusing on violent criminals to sweeping up undocumented workers. Critics argue this reality contradicts the public safety narrative used to justify the raids.</p>

          <h2>China Expands Duty-Free Access for African Nations as US Imposes Tariffs and Aid Cuts</h2>

          <p>China is bolstering its relationship with Africa by announcing expanded duty-free access for products from 53 African countries. This move contrasts sharply with recent U.S. policies, which include threats of foreign aid cuts, visa restrictions for several African nations, and impending tariffs. Observers suggest that these diverging approaches are strengthening the view among African nations that China is a more reliable and beneficial partner. This dynamic challenges the long-held U.S. belief that its humanitarian aid would secure unwavering goodwill on the continent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Holds Unprecedented Recall Election Targeting China-Friendly Lawmakers</h2>

          <p>Taiwanese voters participated in a large-scale recall election on Saturday, deciding the fate of 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). Supporters of the recall are angry that the KMT and its allies have used their legislative majority to block key government legislation, including the defense budget, and pass controversial reforms seen as favoring Beijing. The outcome of this unprecedented vote could reshape the power balance in the legislature and has intensified tensions between those who want to maintain distance from China and those who advocate for closer ties.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation highlights the severe side effects of dopamine agonist drugs, prescribed for conditions like Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome (RLS). The article shares stories of patients developing extreme compulsive behaviors, including hypersexuality and pathological gambling, which have destroyed families and careers. Despite drug manufacturers and regulators knowing about these risks for years, patients and their families report that doctors are still not adequately warning them. The investigation also raises concerns about industry-sponsored studies that may have downplayed negative side effects.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that one of two grenades recovered from a Santa Monica garage is now missing following a deadly explosion last week. The other grenade detonated at a training facility, killing three deputies from the L.A. County Sheriff's Arson Explosives Detail. Investigators believe the missing device was transported to the training facility but have not located it despite an extensive search. The incident, the department's deadliest since 1857, has prompted immediate changes in policy, requiring all explosive devices to be treated as live.</p>
