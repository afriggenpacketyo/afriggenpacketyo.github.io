            <p>Former President Barack Obama issued a statement supporting Harvard University's decision to reject demands from the Trump administration, which had threatened to freeze funding due to alleged inaction on antisemitism. Obama, a Harvard Law School alumnus, praised the university for standing up for academic freedom and urged other institutions to follow suit. He expressed concern over the White House's actions against universities and emphasized the importance of universities resisting intimidation and defending their values, even if it meant sacrificing financial resources. Trump responded by suggesting Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, is back in court after the Salvadoran president claimed he lacks the power to return him. Garcia's attorneys are pushing the Trump administration to comply with a Supreme Court order to facilitate his release from a Salvadoran mega-prison, where he is being held under an agreement in which the U.S. is paying El Salvador to house deported migrants. The Justice Department argues it cannot forcibly extract Garcia from El Salvador, creating a complex legal and diplomatic standoff, with concerns raised about due process and the rule of law. The Supreme Court has ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is drafting a memo to Congress outlining its intent to end nearly all federal funding for public media, including NPR and PBS. This move would rescind $1.1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which partially funds NPR and PBS. The White House claims the networks spread "radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news,'" while NPR argues that eliminating funding would devastate communities relying on public radio for trusted news and information. The proposal follows accusations of political bias and a House Oversight subcommittee hearing in late March. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>LVMH shares plummeted after reporting an unexpected decline in first-quarter sales, causing it to lose its position as the world's largest luxury firm to Hermès. The drop was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China for cognac and a slide in the key fashion and leather goods division. Analysts cited trade tensions, tariffs, and economic uncertainty as headwinds for the luxury sector. Hermès' share price increase allowed its market capitalization to surpass LVMH's, highlighting the impact of trade policy on global supply chains and consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) experienced a nearly 5% increase after Elliott Investment Management acquired a stake exceeding $1.5 billion in the server manufacturer.

This investment follows a period of significant stock decline for HPE, which has lost over a quarter of its value this year. The company's recent quarterly revenue exceeded expectations, but it issued weak fiscal full-year guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A columnist discusses Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's negatively iconic photo op at the White House, using it as a symbol of Democratic dysfunction. The article explores different strategies the Democratic Party can use to fix itself, including resisting Trump, fighting the oligarchy, and technocratic theories of "supply-side liberalism." The columnist suggests the wisest short-term course is to "play dead" while Trump's approval plummets. The problem, however, is the long term as both parties have given up on the idea of being majority parties.</p>

            <p>The Dodgers' celebration of Jackie Robinson Day is being viewed as hypocritical following their recent visit to the Trump White House. This comes after the team's 2020 protest against racial injustice. The visit to Trump, whose casual racism has become normalized, is seen as a betrayal to the Dodgers' history and a missed opportunity to stimulate important conversations. The decision to prioritize team unity over personal convictions is understandable, but it highlights the shift in social climate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Republicans in Congress and several states are pushing to implement work requirements for Medicaid enrollees, arguing that a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. However, Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited. Opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid. The article explores existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients find a job and the challenges in implementing successful programs.</p>

            <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reduced its forecast for global oil demand growth due to the "substantial risks" posed by Donald Trump's trade tariffs. The IEA previously forecast that the world's appetite for crude would rise by 1.03m barrels a day this year to a record high, but after Trump's tariffs on global trade it has cut its forecast growth to 730,000 barrels a day. Concerns that the measures could stoke inflation, slow economic growth, and intensify trade disputes weighed on oil prices.</p>

William Hill has already released odds, with Irish stew being the favorite at 2-1. This tradition started in 1952, and in 1986 champions started honoring their heritage by choosing traditional dishes from their home countries. McIlroy, the first player from Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland to win the Masters, will be tasked with choosing a cuisine that reflects his heritage.</p>

            <p>The Chinese government has instructed its domestic airlines to cease accepting deliveries of Boeing jets as a trade war between the U.S. and China intensifies, according to Bloomberg News. China is also reportedly halting the purchase of airline parts and other components from U.S. companies. The move follows China's increase in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the level of tariffs imposed by President Trump on Chinese imports. The order to stop accepting Boeing jets comes as the trade war escalates.</p>

The 2-year Treasury yield pulled back by about 1 basis point to 3.82%. Although President Donald Trump's 90-day tariff pause on tariffs briefly pulled yields lower, the 10-year yield still rebounded to finish above 4.5% on Friday.

            <p>This personal essay explores why a gay man is coming out as a Taylor Swift fan, despite the resistance from within the gay community. The author explores the reasons why gay men might not embrace Taylor Swift, such as her earnestness, uncoolness, and lack of a tragic backstory. However, the author argues that Swift's refusal to erase her awkward history is confronting for her gay male fans to witness and that her Eras tour allowed him to be free and cringe-worthy for three hours.</p>

            <p>This article explores the deep bond between Jackie Robinson and the Japanese American community in Los Angeles, particularly during the era of restrictive housing covenants and the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. The Robinson family stood by their Japanese American neighbors, helping to safeguard their properties while they were forcibly removed and incarcerated. The friendship between Jackie Robinson and Shigeo "Shig" Takayama, forged through their love of baseball, created cultural transmissions and demonstrated a quiet solidarity that endures as a testament to their shared humanity.</p>
