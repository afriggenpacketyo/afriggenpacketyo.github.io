        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how Republican members of US Congress are allegedly behaving as if they are members of parliament, doing whatever Commander Donald Trump demands. Despite the principle of "balance of powers," the constitution is seemingly an inconvenience for Trump. Some Republican representatives are reportedly unaware of the specifics of the legislation they are voting for, highlighting a lack of transparency. While some ethicists argue that government officials have a duty to speak out against moral rot, the Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski has stated that her colleagues are too scared to express their opinions. The piece concludes that history will be unkind to politicians who put ambition over principle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidelines at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, stemming from an executive order, could allow doctors to refuse treatment to veterans based on factors like marital status or political affiliation, raising concerns about discrimination. While race, color, religion, and sex remain protected, the removal of "politics" and "marital status" from non-discrimination bylaws opens the door for potential denial of care based on personal beliefs. Medical ethicists have criticized these changes as unethical and politically motivated, potentially harming vulnerable veterans, particularly women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those in rural areas with limited healthcare options. The VA maintains that all eligible veterans will receive care, but critics worry about the impact on patient well-being and the erosion of medical ethics. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With increased immigration enforcement actions, foreign-born residents, especially undocumented immigrants, are increasingly concerned about managing their finances in case of detention or deportation. Experts recommend creating a plan that includes designating someone to handle finances through legal means such as a financial power of attorney. Key steps include collecting and securing important documents like birth certificates and immigration paperwork, understanding account access options with financial service providers, and drafting pre-need guardianship documents for children. Planning ahead can help individuals maintain access to their accounts and property and ensure their family's financial well-being in emergency situations.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers, has been arrested near his farm in Green Isle, Minnesota, after a massive 43-hour manhunt. He is accused of fatally shooting State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and attacking Senator John Hoffman and his wife. A target list of dozens of Minnesota Democrats, including the governor and other prominent figures, was found in Boelter's vehicle.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that Scotland will export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England after a landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste takes effect at the end of the year. This is due to insufficient incinerator capacity in Scotland to handle the extra demand. While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from landfills, the short-term impact will likely be an increase in emissions from transporting waste. Concerns have been raised about the logistics of transporting the waste and the potential impact on recycling rates, which have remained stagnant in Scotland.</p>

Dozens of Labour MPs have expressed concerns about the plans, but Starmer insists the reforms are necessary because the current system is not working for those who need support or for taxpayers.

          <p>The increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and data storage is projected to significantly increase electricity consumption, potentially leading to higher electricity bills for consumers. Data centers, which are essential for AI and cloud computing, require vast amounts of power for their operations and cooling systems. As utilities invest in new infrastructure to meet this demand, they are likely to raise rates, impacting households. The heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid.</p>

          <p>An intense battle for influence over President Donald Trump's foreign policy is underway between hawks and an "America First" faction, with the outcome potentially impacting global power dynamics and the likelihood of war. The "America First" group, led by figures like Tucker Carlson and JD Vance, is skeptical of foreign entanglements and challenges the traditional hawkish approach. While the hawks have recently gained ground, the internal conflict highlights fundamental divisions within the Republican Party regarding the US's role in the world and the approach to issues like Iran and China. The piece notes that although the Democratic Party generally despises the America Firstersâ€™ domestic politics, dismisses them as bigots and xenophobes, and are appalled by their calls to abandon Ukraine, itâ€™s worth noting that theyâ€™re the leading GOP figures opposing war with Iran.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved to treat Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by insatiable hunger, offering hope for patients and their families. However, this breakthrough comes as federal funding for health research is being slashed, potentially impacting future progress in obesity and rare disease research. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, cuts to university labs, FDA staff layoffs, and concerns about the dismantling of the nation's medical discovery infrastructure threaten to disrupt ongoing research efforts. Despite the success of Vykat XR, the future of obesity research and drug development remains uncertain.</p>
