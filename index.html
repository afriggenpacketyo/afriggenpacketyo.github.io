          <h2>Bolivian Presidential Election Poised for Unprecedented Runoff</h2>

          <p>Early results from Bolivia's presidential election indicate that the country is heading for its first-ever runoff, signaling a significant political shift after nearly two decades of leftist rule. Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz emerged as the surprise leader, while the candidate for the ruling Movement for Socialism (MAS) party performed poorly, reflecting the party's worst electoral result in a generation. The election was held amid a severe economic crisis and the notable absence of former President Evo Morales, who was barred from running. The outcome suggests a potential end to the long-dominant socialist era in Bolivian politics.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared that any peace deal to end the war in Ukraine would not include the country joining NATO, a long-standing Russian demand. In a social media post made hours before a scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders, Trump also stated that the return of Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, was not a possibility. These comments follow his recent summit with Vladimir Putin and have created significant concern among European allies, who are traveling to Washington to present a united front and ensure Ukraine's interests are central to any negotiations.</p>

          <p>In its latest annual report on the subject, China has accused the United States of weaponizing human rights, describing them as "bargaining chips in power games" and "props for political theatre." The report criticizes the U.S. for what it calls a deeply unequal society, systemic racism, and a hypocritical political system where money controls politics. This publication is part of an ongoing diplomatic conflict where both nations frequently critique each other's human rights records, reflecting the broader tensions in their bilateral relationship and their competing views on global governance and internal affairs.</p>

This move is part of Donald Trump's broader crackdown on what his administration has described as out-of-control crime in the city. However, crime prevention experts and Democratic mayors have criticized the policy, arguing it fails to address the systemic causes of violence. The deployment has heightened political tensions, with leaders in other cities preparing for potential similar actions and vowing to protect their jurisdictions.</p>

Lai faces charges of colluding with foreign forces and sedition, which could result in a life sentence if he is convicted under the Beijing-imposed law. The trial is widely viewed as a critical test of press freedom and judicial independence in the city following the 2019 anti-government protests. The case has drawn international condemnation and concern over Lai's prolonged detention and the broader erosion of civil liberties.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including internet-driven slang terms like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." These additions reflect the significant impact of online culture, particularly from Gen Z and social media platforms, on the evolution of the English language. Other new entries like "mouse jiggler," related to remote work, and "forever chemical," tied to environmental concerns, also highlight contemporary societal shifts. Lexicographers noted that while it's unusual for such slang to be added, these terms were included because they are believed to have lasting power.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. Witkoff described this as a "game-changing" concession that could provide a viable alternative to Ukraine's full NATO membership, a long-standing point of contention for Moscow. This development, if confirmed, could represent a major shift in negotiations to end the war, although details on how such a pact would function remain unclear ahead of further talks.</p>

European leaders are determined to present a united front to ensure that Ukraine is directly involved in any potential peace deal and that it is backed by robust security guarantees. The primary goal is to prevent a private deal between the U.S. and Russia that could compromise Ukraine's sovereignty.

          <p>Kristen Nuss and Taryn Brasher have won the AVP Manhattan Beach Open for the second year in a row, battling back to win a tight three-set final against Megan Kraft and Terese Cannon. Known as the "Wimbledon of beach volleyball," the victory solidifies their status as a top team. In the men's final, Chase Budinger and Miles Evans claimed the title by defeating the duo of Trevor Crabb and Phil Dalhausser. The event was particularly significant as it was one of the last tournaments for the legendary Dalhausser, a four-time Olympian who is retiring.</p>

          <h2>Surgeons and Nurses Identify Most Dangerous Cosmetic Procedures They Would Avoid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 19:16:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical professionals, including plastic surgeons and nurses, have identified several cosmetic procedures they consider too dangerous to undergo themselves. Topping the list is the Brazilian butt lift (BBL), which carries a high risk of fatal fat embolisms. Other procedures of concern include rib removal for a smaller waist, which compromises organ protection, and 'liquid' rhinoplasties using fillers, which can cause blindness if injected into a blood vessel. The consensus highlights that while many procedures are safe, certain trendy or extreme surgeries carry risks that professionals believe outweigh the potential aesthetic benefits.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts delivered a decisive go-ahead home run in the eighth inning, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-4 victory and a crucial series sweep against the San Diego Padres. The dramatic blast was a significant moment for Betts, who has been experiencing a career-worst season at the plate, and it propelled the Dodgers into a two-game lead in the National League West. The game had been tied after the Dodgers bullpen relinquished an early four-run lead, setting the stage for Betts's clutch performance against the Padres' formidable closer, Robert Suarez.</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a strategic crossroads, highlighted by its current leadership election. The race pits the "eco-populist" and more confrontational style of deputy leader Zack Polanski against the more moderate, community-focused approach of current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns. Polanski advocates for a bolder, anti-elite message to connect with voter anger, while his opponents argue for continuing the proven strategy of broad appeal that led to the party's record success in the last general election. The outcome will determine the party's direction as it seeks to build on its recent gains.</p>

          <p>The upcoming meeting in Washington between Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and European allies is fraught with tension, as the unity of the Western alliance against Russia appears threatened. According to this analysis, Ukrainian officials feel betrayed by Trump's recent shift in position following his summit with Vladimir Putin, where he seemed to abandon calls for an immediate ceasefire and appeared open to Ukraine ceding territory. The challenge for Zelenskyy and his European partners will be to steer Trump back toward a unified stance without antagonizing him, as the strategic and political stakes for Ukraine have never been higher.</p>

          <p>The fertility rate in the United States has fallen to a historic low, dropping below the 2.1 children per woman needed for natural population replacement. This demographic trend, mirroring declines in other developed nations like Japan, is raising significant concerns about the country's long-term economic future. Experts point to factors such as women delaying marriage and childbirth, which could lead to a smaller workforce, reduced economic growth, and increased strain on social programs like Social Security. The Trump administration is reportedly considering proposals, such as financial incentives, to encourage more births, though their effectiveness remains debated.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist singer Thompson in Zagreb has exposed deep divisions within Croatian society. The event, attended by hundreds of thousands, featured the controversial chant "Za dom, spremni" ("For homeland, ready!"), which is associated with the country's WWII-era fascist Ustasha regime. While human rights groups and opposition parties have condemned the chant as neo-fascist, supporters, including some government officials, defend it as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence. The concert has ignited a fierce debate over national identity and the interpretation of Croatia's complex history.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis as its population continues a steep decline, a trend that threatens to destabilize its economy, healthcare system, and national defense. With more than two deaths for every birth last year, the country is aging and shrinking at an alarming rate. The government has implemented various measures to encourage higher birth rates, including a city-run dating app in Tokyo and a four-day workweek for some employees. However, these initiatives have so far failed to reverse the trend, which is driven by a punishing work culture, economic stagnation, and shifting social norms around marriage and family.</p>
