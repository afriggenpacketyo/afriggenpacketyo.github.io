          <p>A hiker in Tennessee's Savage Gulf State Park has died after being bitten on the hand by a timber rattlesnake he reportedly picked up. First responders transported him to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, with officials suspecting a severe allergic reaction as the cause of death. Authorities advise the public to avoid handling wildlife and to seek immediate medical attention if bitten. The timber rattlesnake is the largest venomous snake species in the state, though fatal bites are rare.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, recently surpassing a $430 billion market valuation. A significant portion of its growth is driven by U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, the company's valuation is exceptionally high compared to tech giants with far greater earnings, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 280. This indicates investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its AI-powered software. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Monterey Classic Car Auctions See Tepid Sales Expectations Amid Generational Shift</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Monterey Car Week auctions are expected to see sales totals decline for a third consecutive year, with estimates ranging from $367 million to $409 million. Experts attribute the slowdown to a generational shift, as aging baby boomer collectors sell off their 1950s and 1960s cars, while younger millennial and Gen Z buyers favor newer, more practical supercars from the 1980s and beyond. This has led to an oversupply of older high-end vehicles and falling prices, with only one car estimated to sell for over $10 million this year, a significant drop from previous auctions.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is launching a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican-led push in Texas to create more GOP-friendly districts. Newsom has framed the move as fighting "fire with fire" after President Trump encouraged the mid-decade redistricting in Texas. The California plan would require a special election to temporarily suspend the state's popular non-partisan redistricting commission, a move opposed by figures like former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. This political battle is seen as a key front in the fight for control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's move to seize control of Washington D.C.'s policing, citing a need to crack down on crime, is deeply hypocritical. The author, Rebecca Solnit, points out that violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low and contrasts the current situation with the violence of the January 6th Capitol attack, which she states was incited by Trump. The piece posits that the takeover is a right-wing power grab based on false narratives about urban decay, aimed at controlling a diverse, Democratic-leaning city. The author also suggests the move serves as a distraction from other issues, such as the Jeffrey Epstein files.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and federalize the D.C. police force is a unique situation that would be difficult to replicate in other major U.S. cities. Because Washington, D.C. is a federal district and not a state, the president has direct authority over its National Guard and can assume control of its police in emergencies under the Home Rule Act. In contrast, the governors of the 50 states command their own National Guard units, creating a significant legal barrier to similar federal interventions elsewhere. Legal experts note that any attempt to do so in cities like Chicago or Los Angeles would face major legal challenges and run contrary to American traditions of civilian-led, local law enforcement.</p>

A series of burglaries and assaults, culminating in an attack on her daughter, were the final factors in the difficult decision to close.

          <p>This article explores the historical concept of "genius," tracing its definition from an innate, almost spiritual quality in the 19th century to a more scientific, and sometimes problematic, focus on heritability. It notes how early attempts to study genius, like those by Francis Galton, were intertwined with the development of eugenics, a discredited and harmful ideology. The piece reflects on how the term has been applied over time, often subjectively and with cultural biases, to figures from chess prodigies to QVC. Ultimately, it argues that while talent and hard work are crucial, genius is also shaped by luck, timing, and social conditions, making it a complex and ever-shifting idea.</p>

Her lawyers have sent a letter demanding a retraction and apology, calling the assertion "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory." Biden made the comment in a recent interview, attributing it in part to a journalist's retracted story, and has so far refused to back down, stating the threat is a distraction. There is no evidence to support the claim, and a 2016 profile reported the Trumps met at a party hosted by a modeling agency founder.</p>

It also suggests that the economic damage from warming may be less than commonly claimed and that drastic emission-reduction policies could cause more harm than good.

          <p>For individuals struggling with debt amid high interest rates, debt forgiveness and debt management are two distinct relief strategies. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, which can significantly reduce the principal but often damages credit scores and may result in a tax liability on the forgiven amount. Debt management, typically arranged through a credit counseling agency, involves creating a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates to pay the debt in full over time, which is less harmful to one's credit. The better choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Richard Lutz, the chief executive of Germany's state-owned railway, Deutsche Bahn (DB), has been dismissed amid ongoing crises related to the company's finances, infrastructure, and punctuality. Under Lutz's leadership since 2017, the on-time performance of long-distance trains has fallen dramatically to just 62.5%, shattering the railway's former reputation for efficiency. The German government, which owns 100% of DB, has pledged to restructure the company's management and modernize the country's aging rail system. Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder called the situation "dramatic" and is expected to present a new strategy for the railway in September.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council in the UK has reversed its decision to implement higher charges for wider burial plots following a public outcry and media investigation. The proposal, labeled a "fat tax" by critics, would have increased the cost of a larger grave by 20%, a move the council initially defended by citing rising obesity rates and increased operational costs. A local funeral director and residents criticized the plan as discriminatory and an unfair burden on grieving families. After initially defending the plan, the council announced it would "not proceed with the plans."</p>

The offer highlights the immense value of Chrome as a gateway to Google's ad business, with analysts valuing the browser at $50 billion or more.

The price paid by the NHS will not be affected due to a separate, heavily-discounted agreement.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.58%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of falling rates, providing some relief and increased purchasing power for potential homebuyers in a market slowed by high borrowing costs. The decline is partly linked to weaker job market data, which has fueled speculation of a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. However, economists caution that inflationary risks from tariff policies could still push rates back up, with most projecting the average to remain above 6% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>
