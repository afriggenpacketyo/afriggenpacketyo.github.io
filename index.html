          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments linking the man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The decision followed pressure from the FCC and a move by Nexstar Media Group, a major ABC affiliate operator, to preempt the show. While Kimmel has not been fired, the network's action reflects the intense political backlash and the heightened sensitivity surrounding media commentary on the assassination. The move has drawn both praise from conservative figures and condemnation from free speech advocates.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is preparing for more financial turbulence, with its CEO announcing plans to slash its flight schedule by 25% in November and warning employees of additional job cuts. The struggling discount carrier, which recently emerged from its second bankruptcy, is attempting to stabilize its operations by focusing on its most profitable markets. These cost-cutting measures are a direct response to high operating costs, shifting consumer travel preferences, and increased competition following a failed merger with JetBlue. The airline is currently in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors to shrink its operations.</p>

          <p>The Ohio State University has launched a new "AI Fluency" initiative, requiring all incoming freshmen to take courses and workshops on artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. The program aims to equip students with essential AI skills for the modern workforce, where demand for such expertise has surged dramatically. By integrating AI education across all disciplines, the university hopes to give its graduates a competitive edge in a job market increasingly shaped by this technology. The initiative comes as many Americans express skepticism about AI's impact, but educators and industry leaders see it as a vital tool for innovation.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate stocks, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut. The Fed's move, described as a "risk management cut," has sent mixed signals across other Asia-Pacific markets, with some rising while others slid. The rate reduction in the U.S. has shifted attention to the Bank of Japan, which is expected to maintain its current policy rates. The performance of Japanese equities highlights investor optimism in the region, even as global markets digest the Fed's future monetary policy signals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire daycare worker who admitted to secretly giving children melatonin has been sentenced to no jail time after accepting a plea deal. The 53-year-old woman pleaded guilty to falsifying evidence and reckless conduct and received a suspended prison sentence. Her sentence includes a ban from working in daycare, 100 hours of community service, and no unsupervised contact with minors outside her family. Prosecutors noted that the case exposed a loophole in state law regarding child endangerment, which hampered their ability to seek a more severe penalty for the offense.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to formally designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as Antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a post on social media, the president also called for investigations into individuals and groups that allegedly provide funding to Antifa. The practical and legal implications of such a designation remain unclear, as Antifa is not a centrally organized group but rather a decentralized movement. This move represents a significant escalation in the administration's rhetoric and actions against left-leaning activist groups.</p>

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fermented fruit containing enough alcohol to be equivalent to nearly two human cocktails per day. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol content in figs and plums favored by the chimps, confirming a long-held "drunken monkey" hypothesis. The study suggests that the primates are exposed to a steady, low dose of alcohol, which may influence their feeding habits. This finding provides insight into the evolutionary origins of the human attraction to alcohol, stemming from ancestral fruit-eating primates.</p>

          <p>Enrique Tarrio, a key leader of the Proud Boys, has detailed his group's efforts to identify and seek the firing of individuals who celebrated the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk online. Tarrio described an "extremely effective" network that scours social media to find critics and then contacts their employers, a tactic he acknowledged was once used against his own group. This campaign is part of a broader right-wing reaction to Kirk's killing, which has also seen some militia groups use the event as a recruiting opportunity. Tarrio stated that he is now in an "eye for an eye" mindset following his own incarceration.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve enacted a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move seen as a middle path to address a weakening labor market without overstimulating the economy. However, this modest reduction is unlikely to appease President Trump, who has relentlessly pressured the central bank for more significant cuts and has personally attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The decision comes amid the administration's controversial attempt to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook and the unusual appointment of Stephen Miran, who remains a member of the Trump administration while serving on the Fed's board, raising concerns about the institution's independence.

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its interest rate, the Bank of England is widely expected to hold its own key interest rate at 4%. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee had previously cut the rate in August to its lowest level in over two years. With UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut that could fuel further price rises. This cautious approach contrasts with the Fed's move and reflects the specific inflationary pressures currently facing the British economy. (not investment advice)</p>
