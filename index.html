          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges detailed in an indictment. The charges include conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens, stemming from alleged activities between 2016 and 2025. Prosecutors claim that Abrego Garcia conspired to bring migrants from Latin American countries to the U.S., utilizing cellphones and social media platforms to coordinate the movement of migrants, some of whom were allegedly members of MS-13. The case has sparked controversy, especially since Abrego Garcia had previously been granted legal status that forbade his removal to El Salvador. </p>

          <p>The United States has imposed fresh sanctions against judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC), citing concerns over investigations targeting the U.S. and Israel. These measures include restrictions on financial transactions and business dealings with the sanctioned individuals, raising concerns about the ICC's ability to function effectively.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is facing a significant shortage of food inspectors, with nearly 20% of positions vacant, according to agency officials. This staffing gap is attributed to early retirements, resignations, and a hiring freeze implemented by the Trump administration. The agency's ability to fulfill its public health mission, particularly in inspecting food producers and distributors, is increasingly constrained. The inspector general concluded that the FDA needs to increase inspections by over 3,000 each year to meet its goals, as the agency has been falling short of inspection benchmarks set by Congress. </p>

The essay suggests understanding this anti-managerialism is essential to grasping the Trump administration’s efforts to transform institutions.
