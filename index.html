          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has ordered the dismissal of diplomats from his country's embassy in Beijing, accusing them of actively sabotaging the nation's relationship with China. This move comes as Colombia makes a significant geopolitical shift away from its traditional alliance with Washington. The president claimed the diplomats had altered his official schedule and canceled meetings without his consent during a state visit, an action he described as colonialist. This diplomatic purge underscores Colombia's recent commitment to China's Belt and Road Initiative, signaling a new era in its foreign policy.</p>

          <p>In a speech to hundreds of senior military leaders, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared an end to what he called "woke" culture in the armed forces, outlining a major shift toward a more aggressive "warrior ethos." He announced new directives that include raising all physical fitness requirements to a single "male level," ending racial quotas, and toughening grooming standards. Hegseth defended the recent firings of top generals as necessary for cultural change and stated that leaders who cannot adapt to the new, more stringent standards should resign from their positions.</p>

          <p>The chair of Virginia's Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Phyllis Randall, offered a complex perspective on the recent murder of political activist Charlie Kirk. While unequivocally condemning the killing, she also criticized what she termed Kirk's history of promoting political violence and division. Other board members expressed deep concern over the political nature of the assassination and the disturbing trend of individuals celebrating the violence online. The differing remarks from the board highlight the profound and painful divisions that characterize contemporary American political discourse.</p>

          <p>A London Metropolitan Police constable is facing a criminal investigation on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, the police watchdog has confirmed. The probe was launched after a BBC investigation into conduct at a central London police station, with ten other individuals also being investigated for potential gross misconduct. Allegations include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failure to challenge inappropriate behavior. This follows a 2022 report that found "disgraceful" behavior at the same station, suggesting persistent cultural problems within the force.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily reduce the prices of some of its drugs for U.S. consumers, including Medicaid patients. In exchange for this and a $70 billion investment in domestic manufacturing, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. This deal is the first under the administration's "most-favored-nation" policy, which aims to tie U.S. drug prices to the lower costs seen in other developed countries. The White House confirmed that Eli Lilly is also in negotiations for a similar agreement.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the '7-Year Rule' for Credit Card Debt and Its Impact on Credit Reports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the widely misunderstood "7-year rule" concerning credit card debt, explaining its true implications for consumers. The rule, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, primarily mandates that most negative items like late payments and charge-offs must be removed from a credit report seven years after the initial delinquency. However, the article stresses that this does not erase the debt itself, and collectors can still attempt to make contact. Furthermore, the statute of limitations for being sued over the debt varies by state and can be reset by subsequent actions.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda has intensified into a hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean and is now tracking towards Bermuda, prompting a hurricane warning for the island. As the ninth named storm of the season, Imelda is currently sustaining winds of 85 mph and is expected to strengthen further as it moves away from the Bahamas. Although the storm's direct path is not aimed at the United States, forecasters warn that swells generated by the system will likely create life-threatening surf and dangerous rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <h2>Trump Warns of 'Irreversible' Actions Against Democratic Priorities if Government Shuts Down</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Democrats, stating that a government shutdown would grant his administration the authority to take "irreversible" measures. He suggested these actions could include permanently cutting programs favored by Democrats and making significant reductions to the federal workforce. Trump specifically referenced the capabilities of his Office of Management and Budget director, Russell Vought, to implement deep budget cuts that would otherwise be impossible. This threat escalates the political stakes of the funding standoff, implying long-term consequences beyond a temporary service disruption.</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley has predicted that the U.S. market share for all-electric vehicles could be cut in half, potentially falling from about 10% to 5%, after the $7,500 federal consumer tax incentive expires. He stated that the policy change reveals that mainstream consumers find high-priced EVs interesting but too expensive, with hybrid vehicles representing a more acceptable form of partial electrification for now. Farley noted that this shift in policy will create stress for the auto industry, forcing companies like Ford to reassess their EV production capacity and investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a cost analysis for a $200,000 home equity loan in the wake of the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Currently, a 15-year loan would cost a qualified borrower approximately $1,936 per month, while a 10-year term would be about $2,463. While rates are trending favorably for borrowers, the article cautions that taking on such a substantial loan is a significant financial decision. It advises that this option is best suited for homeowners with considerable equity and a solid repayment plan, as the home itself is used as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of House Democrats has accused the Trump administration of potentially seizing the tax refunds of defaulted student loan borrowers without providing the legally required notice. In a letter to the Education Secretary, the lawmakers expressed concern that the government is not issuing a fresh 60-day warning before offsetting payments, a measure intended to give borrowers a chance to respond. With collections having resumed after a multi-year pause, they argue that relying on old notices from before the pandemic is improper and fails to account for significant changes in borrowers' lives.</p>

          <p>Florida state officials have granted final approval for the construction of the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library on a 2.6-acre plot of land in downtown Miami, adjacent to the city's historic Freedom Tower.

The project has drawn criticism from some historians and community members, who argue that placing the library next to the Freedom Tower, a symbol of freedom for Cuban refugees, is inappropriate and contradictory.</p>

          <p>An article reflects on the enduring legacy of actor James Dean on the 70th anniversary of his fatal car accident. Dean was only 24 and had completed just three films when he died, but his intense performances in movies like "Rebel Without a Cause" captured the spirit of youthful rebellion and made him a cultural icon. His sudden death at the peak of his burgeoning fame cemented his legendary status, leading to two unprecedented posthumous Oscar nominations. His image remains a powerful symbol of the "live fast, die young" ethos in Hollywood history.</p>
