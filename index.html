          <h2>Super Micro Issues Disappointing Guidance Citing Economic Uncertainty and Tariff Impacts</h2>

          <p>Super Micro, a server manufacturer, has released weaker-than-expected guidance, attributing the shortfall to 'economic uncertainty and tariff impacts' following Trump's announcement of new tariffs on imported goods, and the stock has since slid about 4% in extended trading. CEO Charles Liang noted delays in customer commitments due to evaluations of AI platforms and tariff-related uncertainty which also led to the company refraining from providing fiscal 2026 guidance. Despite a 19% year-over-year revenue growth, net income declined, and the company is navigating challenges related to short seller reports and auditor resignations, though an independent investigation found no substantial concerns about senior management's integrity.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India conducted strikes on nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. The Indian government asserts the strikes were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, targeting terrorist infrastructure without hitting Pakistani military facilities, while Pakistan has vowed to respond to this 'act of war.' President Trump called the situation a 'shame' and hoped for a quick resolution, as international bodies urge restraint to prevent further military escalation between India and Pakistan. The strikes mark a significant intensification of the ongoing conflict over Kashmir, a region both countries claim.</p>

          <p>Florida Fish and Wildlife officers killed three black bears that may have been responsible for a deadly attack on an 89-year-old man and his dog near Naples, marking the first ever deadly bear attack on a human in the state.

Officials urge residents to remain alert, emphasizing that while bear attacks on humans are rare, conflicts between bears and dogs are common.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to merge the responsibilities of the Palestinian Affairs Office into the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, reinstating a diplomatic framework established during President Trump's first term. The decision, announced by State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, aims to create a unified U.S. diplomatic mission in Israel's capital reporting to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee. This move reverses the Biden administration's establishment of the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs in 2022 and aligns with the U.S. Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which recognizes Jerusalem as Israelâ€™s capital. The United States, according to Bruce, remains committed to its historic relationship with Israel and to securing peace in the region.</p>

The island, located off the west coast of Scotland, provides an escape from the hustle and bustle of big-city life, though attracting young people to the island has been a challenge. Irvine hopes this opportunity will bring new life to the community, which faces issues with affordable housing and limited job opportunities.</p>

Despite these challenges, Rivian reaffirmed its plan to achieve a 'modest positive gross profit' this year, as well as $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in losses on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The company's first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street's expectations, supported by its second consecutive quarter of gross profit.</p>

The administration has publicly stated its intention to scrutinize and remove noncitizen students involved in campus unrest related to the war in Gaza, which lawyers argue violates the First Amendment. This legal strategy aims to move quickly on technical grounds while delaying decisions on core constitutional claims, effectively slowing some cases but leaving the students' fates to be determined by arbitrary factors.

Even if passed, the incentive may not guarantee a return of filming to the U.S., especially if other countries increase their tax credit programs, though the industry has been battered in recent years by the effects of the pandemic, the dual writersâ€™ and actorsâ€™ strikes in 2023 and cutbacks in spending by the studios.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a widely recognized energy efficiency certification for home appliances, as part of an agency reorganization. According to documents and a recording of an internal meeting, the EPA will also eliminate divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency, with staff potentially reassigned to other positions within the agency's air offices. This decision has sparked concern from industry experts and advocates who argue that the Energy Star program, which has saved households and businesses billions in energy costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, is crucial for promoting energy efficiency and reducing household costs.</p>

          <p>Starting May 7, travelers will need a Real ID or another approved form of identification, such as a passport, to board domestic flights, as the U.S. government enforces the Real ID Act after years of postponed deadlines. The Real ID Act sets minimum standards for state-issued documentation to enhance security, requiring individuals to provide a Social Security number, verify their address, and prove their identity and lawful status. While a Real ID is sufficient for domestic flights, it will not allow travelers to cross international borders, and those without compliant identification may still be allowed to fly after additional identity verification.</p>

          <p>Mattel, the toy maker behind Barbie and Hot Wheels, is considering raising prices on U.S. toys due to the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, although President Trump has suggested children can cut back on the number of toys they have. The company is taking mitigating actions to offset the potential cost impact of tariffs, including diversifying its manufacturing locations and relying less on China, with plans to lower the percentage of U.S. toy production based in China in the coming years. The U.S. Toy Assn. and other global toy groups are advocating for zero tariffs on toys to ensure access to play for the greatest number of children and families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices are declining due to concerns about a potential slowdown in the global economy caused by sweeping tariffs, despite President Trump's promise of lower gasoline prices and booming U.S. oil production. While lower oil prices benefit consumers through reduced gasoline and shipping costs, they also negatively impact U.S. oil producers, who may cut spending and hiring. The situation is further complicated by OPEC+'s decision to increase oil production, putting additional pressure on prices and potentially hampering U.S. production, which runs counter to Trump's vision of an expanding U.S. oil industry.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced plans to reduce the number of senior admirals and generals by a minimum of 20 percent and transform the Army to focus on homeland defense and deter China, although specific details are scarce. Hegseth's memo directs the Pentagon to streamline leadership by cutting the number of senior officers and restructuring the Army to prioritize long-range missiles, missile defense, and cyber capabilities. Critics have raised concerns about the lack of detail and the potential for partisan motivations behind the cuts, questioning whether they will amount to a 'partisan litmus test' rather than a strategic restructuring.</p>

This decision, the third such rollback under President Trump, allows BNPL firms like Affirm to avoid stringent consumer protections, including standardized disclosures and dispute investigations. The CFPB is considering rescinding the rule entirely, citing a need to focus resources on pressing threats to consumers, although new data reveals that nearly half of BNPL users have faced financial problems tied to these services.</p>
