          <p>President Donald Trump clarified that he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends next year, marking a significant shift in his rhetoric. Trump has previously criticized Powell and declined to rule out his removal, putting pressure on the Fed chair to cut interest rates. This announcement led to a sharp rise in U.S. stock futures across major indexes, suggesting market confidence in the stability of the Fed leadership. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the independent central bank regarding monetary policy.</p>

Judge Paula Xinis has criticized the DOJ's "bad faith refusal" to comply with discovery obligations and ordered a speedy fact-finding process. Abrego Garcia's lawyers say the government is using privilege assertions to obstruct discovery, while the DOJ claims it is making a good-faith effort. The case involves allegations that the Trump administration refused to comply with court orders to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. so he can receive due process regarding the claim that he is an MS-13 gang member.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, working with food companies to remove them. The FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the agencies are looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and to work with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in cereal, ice cream, snacks, yogurts and more. Studies have linked these dyes to health conditions like ADHD, obesity, and cancer, although the FDA's plan is contingent on cooperation from major food companies. The International Association of Color Manufactures has questioned the proposed timeline.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk faces increasing pressure from investors to refocus on the automaker as first-quarter results reveal a significant drop in sales and profits. Investors are concerned about Musk's involvement with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its impact on Tesla's performance. Musk announced plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE starting next month, but will continue his involvement throughout Trump's term. The company cautioned that trade policy and changing political sentiment could impact demand for its products, as tariffs are expected to increase vehicle prices.</p>

Increased tariffs could lead to reduced cargo volumes, higher costs for importers, and potential loss of foreign investment.

          <p>Elon Musk has announced he will reduce his time with Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from May, as Tesla grapples with falling sales. The cuts, which included axing government jobs, have divided the country and prompted a backlash against his company. Tesla said that quarterly profits fell by 71% to $409m (£306.77m) from $1.39bn (£1.04bn) in the first quarter of 2024. Revenues were also well below forecasts, dropping 9% to $19.3bn (£14.5bn) between January and March.</p>

The IMF forecasts UK inflation to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%, attributing it to higher energy and water bills. The fund also revised down its economic growth forecast for the UK in 2025 to 1.1%, citing the global impact of US trade tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized that the IMF still sees stronger economic growth in the UK compared to other major European countries.</p>

The author argues that American society is plagued with serious imbalances, and Trump can draw inspiration from how China is restoring harmony to its society, which is also out of sync after decades of high but lopsided economic growth. Chinese leaders use a matrix of philosophy, power, and pragmatism for policymaking, and Trump should prioritize stabilizing America.</p>
