        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a major U-turn on its plan to cut disability benefits, following a significant rebellion from its own MPs. The reversal was prompted by criticism that the cuts were a short-term cost-saving measure rather than a part of a comprehensive long-term welfare reform. This event has raised serious questions about the new government's day-to-day management and the overall credibility of its long-term strategy for national renewal. The episode highlights the tension between achieving immediate fiscal targets and implementing structural reforms to address rising health-related welfare claims.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury, delivering a slick and professional set filled with their biggest hits. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered a more restrained performance, largely avoiding his past on-stage antics and political commentary. While the band was musically tight and the show was a crowd-pleaser, some critics found it lacked the raw, untamed energy of their previous performances. The set was part of a day that also featured a surprise, emotional comeback from Lewis Capaldi two years after a difficult performance.</p>

          <p>An Egyptian national was deported from the United States after pleading guilty to harming a law enforcement animal at Washington Dulles International Airport. The 70-year-old man violently kicked a 5-year-old CBP beagle named Freddy during a baggage inspection when the dog alerted officers to his suitcase. The kick was forceful enough to lift the 25-pound dog off the ground, causing bruising, though Freddy is expected to fully recover. A subsequent search of the man's luggage revealed over 100 pounds of prohibited agricultural products, which were seized.</p>

The arrest was peaceful, and officials are now investigating individuals who may have assisted Massey while he was a fugitive.

He called the prosecution a "fake trial" and asserted that the allegations are primarily motivated by money.

Industry unions and advocates applauded the decision, seeing it as a crucial step to revitalize local production and bring jobs back to the state.

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, limited the power of lower federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, handing a significant victory to the Trump administration. The ruling partially stays injunctions against President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, though it does not rule on the order's constitutionality. This means the policy cannot be enforced against the specific plaintiffs in the case, but the administration can proceed with implementation plans elsewhere. The decision represents a major shift in judicial power, curbing a key tool used to block executive actions.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet to study atmospheric data and sample gasses. As part of the Student Airborne Research Program, the aircraft will perform maneuvers like vertical spirals over urban areas, landfills, and power plants. NASA is advising the public not to be alarmed by the low-flying planes, explaining it is part of a planned scientific mission.</p>

          <p>A team of technical divers has completed the first-ever human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank in a storm off the coast of Sydney in 1904, killing all 32 people aboard. The shipwreck, discovered in 2022, lies at a depth of about 525 feet, requiring a complex and challenging dive in complete darkness. The divers had only nine minutes to survey and film the wreck, documenting its condition and the scattered coal from its cargo. The historic mission provides new insights into the century-old maritime disaster.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a dangerous expansion of presidential authority. By curtailing the ability of lower courts to block potentially unconstitutional executive orders, the ruling effectively gives the president unchecked power to defy the law, according to the author. The piece contends that the decision, made in the context of President Trump's birthright citizenship order, threatens the rule of law and creates a chaotic system where constitutional rights vary by location. The author criticizes the court's conservative majority for what they describe as a politically motivated decision.</p>

They are now advocating for more research into these effects and for greater recognition from the medical community.

          <p>This article explores a potential revival of the Tea Party's fiscal conservative ideals within the Republican party, fifteen years after its original emergence. Some of the movement's original figures, like Senator Rand Paul, are now challenging President Trump's latest tax cut proposals, arguing they lack corresponding spending cuts and are fiscally irresponsible. This creates a dynamic reminiscent of the 2010s, when hardline conservatives criticized the GOP establishment for not being confrontational enough on spending. However, this new wave faces the challenge of opposing a popular Republican president, unlike the original movement which organized against a Democratic one.</p>

The ongoing war has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with over 56,000 people killed, according to the territory's health ministry.
