          <p>A recipe for cacio e pepe on the UK's Good Food website has caused fury in Italy for its inauthentic ingredients and approach. The recipe listed parmesan and butter, deviating from the traditional pecorino cheese and omitting butter entirely, which Italian culinary experts argue transforms it into a different dish. This incident highlights the deep cultural importance Italians place on culinary tradition and the strict adherence to authentic recipes, viewing such modifications as a misunderstanding of their heritage. The controversy has been widely covered by Italian media, prompting a formal complaint from a restaurant association.</p>

          <p>UK fashion retailer River Island has received High Court approval for a restructuring plan to prevent collapse, which includes closing 33 stores. The company cited a major shift to online shopping and rising operational costs as reasons for its multi-million pound losses, warning it could face insolvency without the changes. In addition to the store closures, the plan involves rent reductions at 71 other locations and making about 110 head office roles redundant. The chief executive stated the decision provides a strong platform to deliver the company's transformation strategy for a sustainable future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Sharon Stone has stated that despite her iconic Hollywood career, modeling continues to be her most lucrative source of income. Stone also discussed her financial struggles following a severe health scare in 2001, revealing she lost her $18 million in savings and had to rebuild her finances from scratch. She attributes her recovery to maintaining faith and choosing to live for joy and purpose rather than holding onto bitterness. The article highlights the financial realities of fame, including the high costs associated with being a public figure and the disparity in pay she experienced in major film roles.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) will take over the investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows calls for transparency, as critics argued the local police force should not investigate its own former officers. One woman reported being subjected to sexual assault by an officer, and five women in total have come forward stating they were also abused by police while being exploited by grooming gangs. The move is intended to ensure victims feel confident in reporting and to place them at the center of the investigation.</p>

Many residents fear another displacement after already enduring a year of humiliation and hardship, while others direct anger at Hamas for failing to negotiate an end to the war.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast has emerged between the global legal understanding of climate responsibility and the current stance of the United States. The International Court of Justice recently issued an opinion stating that nations have a binding legal obligation to protect the climate, making failure to curb emissions an illegal act. Conversely, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a plan to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding, the legal basis for nearly all federal actions against greenhouse gases. This divergence places the U.S. in opposition to a growing international legal trend that holds states accountable for climate harm.</p>

          <p>As part of a BBC Sport campaign, Premier League fans have shared the personal and often deeply emotional reasons they support their football clubs. The stories reveal that connections are forged through family tradition, childhood heroes like Paul Gascoigne, or memorable personal encounters with club legends like Brian Clough. For some, like the parent of an autistic child, the club provides a vital safe space and a source of joy. These accounts illustrate how football fandom creates a powerful sense of community and shared identity, offering a feeling of belonging in an increasingly isolated world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of early August 2025, national average interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage are approximately 6.75%, while a 15-year fixed mortgage averages around 5.99%. Refinance rates are slightly higher, with a 30-year refinance at 6.88% and a 15-year at 6.21%. While these rates are higher than in previous years, there is cautious optimism for borrowers as the Federal Reserve may pause its rate hikes. To secure the best possible rate, prospective homebuyers and refinancers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders.

          <p>As of August 8, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,395.31 per ounce, reflecting its status as an attractive safe-haven asset for investors. The value of this precious metal is in constant fluctuation, influenced by a variety of economic and geopolitical factors. Key drivers include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and central bank policies. Gold prices also tend to have an inverse relationship with interest rates and can be affected by the strength of the U.S. dollar and overall market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent constitutional amendment in Togo has allowed President Faure Gnassingbe to transition to a new, unelected role as President of the Council of Ministers, effectively cementing his power indefinitely. Critics and civil rights activists are calling this a "constitutional coup," as it allows the Gnassingbe family, which has ruled for 58 years, to bypass direct elections. This move is raising fears that it could serve as a blueprint for other African leaders seeking to extend their rule without facing the electorate. The development is seen as a significant setback for democracy and human rights in the region.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old footballer, Adam Golebiewski, who had both of his lower legs amputated following a car crash, has stated he will never forgive the driver. Golebiewski was a passenger in a car driven by 19-year-old Arran Paterson, who pleaded guilty to dangerous driving while over the drink-drive limit. After months of intensive rehabilitation, the teenager walked into court on prosthetic legs, expressing his anger but also his determination to stay positive and enjoy life again. He credited his family and friends for their support throughout his recovery from the life-altering incident.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan for the Israel Defense Forces to take control of Gaza City, a move condemned by world leaders and opposed by hostage families. The plan outlines five principles for ending the war, including disarming Hamas, returning hostages, and establishing an alternative civil administration. However, many details remain unclear, including the timeline for the takeover and how humanitarian aid will be managed for the hundreds of thousands of civilians in the city. The announcement is seen by some as a strategy to pressure Hamas in negotiations, while others fear it marks a severe escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have found compelling evidence of a giant gas planet in Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. Located just over four light-years away, the potential planet is in our astronomical "neighbourhood" and orbits a star similar to our Sun. While the gas giant itself would be lifeless, it could host habitable moons, similar to the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. The signs were detected via direct imaging, but astronomers must now conduct follow-up observations to definitively confirm the planet's existence, a challenging task due to the brightness of its parent stars.</p>

          <p>An analysis of England's Championship football league reveals a staggering rate of managerial turnover, with only one of the 18 returning teams having the same manager as the start of the previous season. Portsmouth's John Mousinho is the sole survivor in what he describes as a "brutal league" where mistakes are heavily punished. This high turnover contrasts sharply with the Premier League and lower divisions, where managerial stability is comparatively greater. The article details the numerous changes across the clubs, highlighting the immense pressure and high stakes involved in managing at this competitive level of English football.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Planned Parenthood affiliate in Ohio has announced it will stop accepting Medicaid insurance due to uncertainty surrounding potential federal funding cuts. The move is a reaction to a legal battle over a provision in a Trump-era law that would defund abortion providers, with the affiliate fearing the administration could attempt to claw back payments if a court injunction is overturned. The decision highlights the precarious financial situation for some clinics, as another Ohio affiliate has also stopped providing costly long-acting contraceptives to Medicaid patients for similar reasons, impacting access to care for low-income individuals.</p>

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll reveals that a large portion of California voters remain undecided about key political issues, including the 2026 governor's race and a potential redrawing of congressional districts. In the gubernatorial field, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter leads with 18%, but 38% of voters are undecided. Similarly, when asked about a proposed special election to redraw congressional maps—a Democratic effort to counter GOP moves in other states—42% of voters were unsure. These results indicate a highly fluid political landscape in the state, with candidate and issue outcomes far from certain.</p>
