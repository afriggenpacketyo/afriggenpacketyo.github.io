          <p>In an unconventional agreement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will give the federal government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he personally negotiated the figure down from 20% with Nvidia's CEO. This arrangement, which provides the government a direct revenue stream from corporate exports, is highly unusual and comes after the administration had previously restricted sales of these advanced chips to China on national security grounds. The move aims to balance economic competition with strategic concerns over AI dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he will know within the first few minutes of his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin whether a peace deal for Ukraine is achievable. Describing the summit in Alaska as a "feel-out meeting," Trump indicated he might tell the leaders to "keep fighting" or that a deal can be made, potentially involving land swaps. The announcement has caused concern among European allies and in Ukraine, as Trump has been dismissive of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's direct involvement in these initial high-stakes talks.</p>

The initiative was announced after federal immigration agents mistakenly detained a 15-year-old student with disabilities at gunpoint outside Arleta High School. This incident has heightened fears among immigrant families, prompting the district to increase protective perimeters with staff, volunteers, and police to reassure the community that schools remain safe environments.</p>

          <p>In Mexico City's Xochimilco canals, scientists are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for the critically endangered axolotl, a unique salamander native only to this area. With the population having plummeted from thousands per square kilometer to just a few dozen, traditional net surveys often come up empty. By filtering water for genetic traces, researchers can detect the creature's presence, offering a non-invasive way to monitor the species and providing hope that conservation efforts in protected refuge areas are working.</p>

          <p>Residents of Paterson, New Jersey's third-largest city, are facing a fourth day with little or no water service after a 140-year-old water main broke. The disruption has left thousands frustrated and relying on bottled water and portable showers and toilets set up by the city. Officials now expect repairs to be completed by Tuesday night, but a boil water advisory affecting nearly 200,000 customers in the area will likely continue through the end of the week.</p>

          <p>U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has begun a 50-state tour to advocate for the Trump administration's controversial goal of abolishing the Department of Education. McMahon argues that returning education policy and funding control to the states encourages local innovation, pointing to recent literacy improvements in Louisiana as a model. The plan faces strong opposition from Democrats and legal challenges, with critics warning that it would create chaos and jeopardize federal funding for students with disabilities and low-income schools.</p>
