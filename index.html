          <p>A New York court has blocked President Trump's trade policy, which involves hiking tariffs on various countries, creating financial and economic uncertainty. The administration's justification for the tariffs, citing a national emergency related to fentanyl and trade imbalances, was rejected by the court, which deemed it an overreach of executive power. While an appeals court has temporarily stayed the decision, the legal challenge adds another layer of complexity for businesses navigating the global economy. Despite the setback, the Trump administration remains determined to pursue its tariff agenda, potentially leading to further legal battles and market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a knife attack in Hamburg, conflicting accounts and manipulated images flooded social media, calling into question reports of heroism by a Syrian teenager named Muhammad al-Muhammad. The original image of al-Muhammad standing in front of the Brandenburg Gate has been altered and placed in different locations, accompanied by sarcastic remarks. These posts aim to undermine the credibility of the media and create doubt about al-Muhammad's role in stopping the attack. Experts warn that such disinformation tactics contribute to a climate of uncertainty and distrust, echoing right-wing sentiments. The spread of misinformation online is a concern that has been growing in recent years, which is why it is being discussed here.</p>

          <p>CPAC held large gatherings in Poland and Hungary, signaling a push by US-backed conservatives to gain mainstream influence in Europe. Speakers at the conferences derided the EU's Green Deal, mass immigration, and "gender and woke madness", promoting a vision of a new Europe based on national identity and traditional values. While the MAGA movement in Europe has faced setbacks, it continues to seek opportunities to network and reshape the European project with its own brand of conservativism. The events highlight the growing divide between mainstream conservatives and more nationalist and populist factions within Europe, but it is still important to understand the context.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of undermining the next round of peace talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul. According to Ukraine, Russia has yet to send its negotiating proposals, a key demand from Kyiv, and President Zelenskyy has stated that Moscow is doing everything it can to ensure the meeting is fruitless. Despite this, Ukraine has sent its proposals and reaffirmed its readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire. The accusations come as both sides reported explosions, raising concerns about the commitment to de-escalation. These accusations have the potential to destabilize the already fragile situation and undermine efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's initiative to release stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has begun, offering consumers cheaper products. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice, priced at 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The rice has been selling out quickly, reflecting consumer demand for affordable staples. The government hopes that selling directly to retailers will be more effective in curbing soaring rice prices and alleviating financial strain on households. This has the potential to help Japanese consumers save money on food.</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a member of the Manson "family", has been recommended for parole by a California prisons panel. Krenwinkel is serving a life sentence for her involvement in the 1969 Los Angeles killing spree, including the murder of Sharon Tate and others. The parole board found that Krenwinkel, now 77, poses a low risk of reoffending due to her age and good behavior in prison. The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022. Krenwinkel has spent many years in prison, and she is now seeking release.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax bill includes a 3.5% tax on remittances made by non-US citizens, which is expected to significantly impact African economies. Remittances are a major source of income for many African countries, often outweighing aid and foreign direct investment.

          <p>President Trump praised Nippon Steel Corp. for its partnership deal with United States Steel Corp., backing the Japanese company's $14 billion investment. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel will continue to be controlled by the USA, and said he will raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent. Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, a move that was previously blocked by the Biden administration due to national security concerns. The deal is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the American economy, according to Trump. This has the potential to make the United States more competitive in the global economy.</p>
