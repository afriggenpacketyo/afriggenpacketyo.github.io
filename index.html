This occurred after Waltz faced scrutiny for inadvertently inviting a journalist to a Signal group chat discussing sensitive military plans. Despite the administration's defense of Signal as an approved app, the Pentagon's watchdog previously criticized its use for official business, and an investigation into Hegseth's use of Signal is underway.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed lawsuits against Hawaii, Michigan, New York, and Vermont, challenging their climate policies as unconstitutional and a threat to U.S. energy security. The lawsuits target New York and Vermont's "climate superfund" laws, which impose liability on fossil fuel companies, and aim to block Hawaii and Michigan from suing fossil fuel companies over past climate harms. The DOJ argues that these state laws are preempted by federal law, violate the Constitution, and impede the production of affordable energy.</p>

          <p>Apple plans to shift most iPhone production for the U.S. market to India to mitigate the impact of Trump's tariffs. iPads will be sourced from Vietnam. CEO Tim Cook believes tariffs will add significant costs during the current quarter. Apple's reliance on Chinese factories exposed the company to the trade war, causing a stock plunge. Sales in China also fell, but Cook emphasized that devices sold outside the U.S. will continue to be made in China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants. A federal judge had previously blocked the administration's plan, citing procedural violations and potential racial bias. The administration argues that the law creating TPS bars judicial review of executive branch decisions. The Supreme Court has been involved in several other immigration-related cases, including those concerning the return of a wrongly deported individual and the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>China is considering trade negotiations with the United States after receiving proposals from Washington, signaling a potential easing of the tariff war. A ministry spokesperson stated that if the U.S. wants to talk, it must "demonstrate sincerity by addressing its wrong practices" and remove all unilateral tariffs. Dan Wang of the Eurasia Group suggests the statement does not indicate a shift in China's political stance. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 145% on imported Chinese goods this year, prompting retaliatory levies from China.</p>

Authorities said hot and dry conditions, with strong winds, made controlling the fires more challenging, and a senior official warned they could flare up again.</p>
