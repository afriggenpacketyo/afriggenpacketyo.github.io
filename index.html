          <p>President Trump dismissed at least three National Security Council officials, citing disloyalty.  The firings followed a meeting with far-right activist Laura Loomer, who reportedly urged the president to remove specific employees.  The White House declined to comment on personnel matters, and the reasons for the dismissals remain unclear, though a prior messaging incident involving a journalist may have played a role. More firings are anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve faces a difficult policy choice due to President Trump's new tariffs, which could simultaneously increase inflation and slow economic growth.

          <p>The recent online harassment of a college student following a salacious rumor spread by a sports talk show highlights the resurgence of 2000s-style slut-shaming.  The incident involves elements reminiscent of past instances of public humiliation of young women, but with the added dimension of memecoins and right-wing social media platforms.  The author connects this to broader trends of raunch culture and purity culture within the contemporary political landscape. The author explores the ways in which this type of harassment is enabled and amplified by specific online and political environments.</p>
