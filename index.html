          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent visit to Washington D.C. was largely overshadowed by the public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Despite the distraction, the visit was considered a success for Merz, who managed to address several key issues with Trump, including strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs, and support for Ukraine. Merz also emphasized Germany's commitment to increased defense spending and presented Trump with his grandfather's birth certificate to highlight the historical ties between the two nations. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party was seemingly avoided during the discussions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a recent jobs report indicating a stronger-than-expected labor market. Trump argued that such a cut would lower both long- and short-term debt rates and boost the economy, even suggesting that Powell could raise rates again if inflation were to increase. This latest demand continues Trump's pattern of pressuring the Fed for lower rates, a dynamic that has become routine during his second term. Trump maintains that the U.S. economy is thriving despite Powell's policies.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's shares experienced a significant drop of approximately 20% after the company reduced its full-year earnings guidance, citing a "dynamic macroenvironment." While the company's first-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street expectations, concerns about tariffs and a slowing U.S. economy have led to a more cautious outlook. Lululemon plans to implement strategic price increases on a small portion of its product line to mitigate the impact of tariffs. The company expects full-year revenue to remain unchanged from its previous forecast, but anticipates lower earnings per share than initially projected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Suzuki Motor Corp. has temporarily suspended production of its Swift compact hatchback due to export restrictions imposed by China on rare-earth elements. These restrictions, part of China's retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have caused delays in procuring essential parts that utilize rare earths.

          <p>A phone call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, focused on easing trade tensions, has heightened concerns in Taiwan about being marginalized. Xi reportedly emphasized the need to handle the Taiwan question with prudence, while Trump stated that the U.S. would honor the one-China policy. This call has reinforced skepticism in Taiwan regarding the U.S.'s commitment, particularly in light of Trump's comments on defense, semiconductors, and tariffs. Taiwanese officials express anxiety about their trade negotiations, noting that both Japan and mainland China appear to be ahead.</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new, stricter capital regulations for UBS, requiring the banking giant to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse. These measures aim to ensure UBS fully capitalizes its foreign units and potentially reduces share buybacks. The Swiss National Bank supports these regulations, citing that they will significantly strengthen UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of a government bailout in a crisis. UBS shares experienced a jump following the announcement, with analysts noting that the news was "as bad as it will get for UBS." (not investment advice)</p>
