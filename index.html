          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed that some National Guard members in Washington D.C., fewer than 50, will be armed, marking an escalation in President Trump's intervention into local policing. This decision comes despite the Pentagon initially stating troops would not carry weapons, and local officials asserting a decline in violent crime in the city, contradicting Trump's claims of an "epidemic of crime." The Joint Task Force clarified that the armed personnel would operate under established Rules for the Use of Force, allowing force only as a last resort against imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm. This unprecedented step, with nearly 2,000 Guard members already stationed, has sparked significant debate over federal overreach and the militarization of the capital.</p>

          <p>Following the "Great Resignation" during the Covid-19 pandemic, global labor markets, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., are now experiencing a notable shift towards a "Great Stay" and a "no-hire, no-fire" environment. This trend is characterized by fewer employees voluntarily leaving their jobs and companies showing reluctance to hire new workers or initiate layoffs. Economists attribute this shift to economic insecurity and uncertainty, with firms putting hiring decisions on hold rather than actively reducing headcount. This article highlights unusually low turnover rates in sectors like IT, indicating a cautious and stagnant, yet stable, employment landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. This moderation in price pressures occurs as the city-state prepares for an anticipated growth slowdown later in the year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has already adjusted its monetary policy twice this year to mitigate the impact of weaker global trade and rising trade tensions. The article notes that a baseline 10% reciprocal tariff from the Trump administration on Singapore's exports to the U.S. is a contributing factor to the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of China's state-backed Dongfeng Motor Group skyrocketed to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private, reportedly valuing it at about $7 billion. This strategic move aligns with a directive from China's State Council to consolidate and enhance the competitiveness of major state-owned carmakers. The Wuhan-based company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. Despite a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries in the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed significantly, making up roughly a quarter of total deliveries.

          <p>Scotland's longest road, the A9, has tragically claimed 48 lives in the past decade, with a recent crash devastating an American family visiting the Highlands. The road's dangerous design, which frequently alternates between single and dual carriageways, encourages risky overtaking maneuvers and hazardous right turns. A government pledge from 2007 to dual the entire 113-mile stretch between Inverness and Perth by 2025 has been delayed by a decade to 2035, drawing intense criticism from safety campaigners. This article highlights the profound and lasting impact of these accidents on families, underscoring the urgent need for infrastructure improvements.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, currently leading in national opinion polls, is urging energy firms to prepare for fracking if it gains power, aiming to unlock vast shale gas reserves. The controversial extraction method has been repeatedly banned in the UK since 2011 due to concerns over earthquakes and environmental impacts. Former energy ministers, once optimistic, are now skeptical, citing the UK's complex geology and high costs compared to the US. Reform UK plans to immediately lift the ban and conduct independently monitored test wells, but without public investment, relying on an attractive regulatory framework to entice private sector involvement.</p>

Djokovic, who has scaled back his schedule to focus on Grand Slams, expressed surprise at his physical struggles but credited his ability to secure crucial points. This win marks his 75th consecutive first-round victory at a Grand Slam event, a new Open era record.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump publicly threatened to investigate former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former ally turned critic, following Christie's appearance on ABC's "This Week." Trump's social media post linked Christie to the "Bridgegate" scandal, despite a Supreme Court decision overturning convictions related to it. This threat aligns with Trump's stated campaign promise to use the Justice Department for political retribution, echoing similar actions against former National Security Adviser John Bolton. Christie had questioned the credibility of Ghislaine Maxwell's statements regarding Trump and criticized the president's handling of classified information.</p>

          <p>Hopes are fading for Natalia Nagovitsyna, an experienced mountaineer who has been stranded for 12 days on Kyrgyzstan's icy Jengish Chokusu after breaking her leg. Repeated rescue efforts have been hampered by extreme weather conditions, including heavy snowfall, leading to the suspension of the search. One Italian climber attempting to save her also died. Nagovitsyna was last spotted alive on August 19, but her current condition is unknown. Victory Peak, at 24,400 feet, is known for its extraordinarily harsh conditions and is considered one of the world's most difficult mountains to climb.</p>

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency as its infant mortality rate reached 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average and the highest in over a decade.

The declaration aims to expand prenatal services, regionalize obstetric care, and strengthen community health programs, with officials emphasizing that improving maternal health is key. Experts also highlight the impact of structural inequities, poverty, and potential federal funding cuts to vital maternal and child health programs.</p>

          <p>France has summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron, alleging France was not doing enough to combat rising antisemitism, calling the claims "unacceptable."

This diplomatic spat follows Macron's rejection of similar criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and comes amidst broader U.S.-France tensions over trade and international policy, though relations have eased on Ukraine support.</p>

          <p>Chinese property developer Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a grim milestone in its spectacular collapse under massive debt. Once valued at over $50 billion, the company's fall began after Beijing introduced rules to control developer borrowing in 2020, leading to defaults and a liquidation order in January 2024. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined and banned from China's capital market for overstating revenue. The crisis, which has impacted the Chinese economy significantly, continues to affect other developers and household savings, with no clear end in sight. (not investment advice)</p>

Fox News, currently facing a defamation suit from Smartmatic, is seeking records alleging LA County Registrar Dean Logan received unreported gifts from the company.
