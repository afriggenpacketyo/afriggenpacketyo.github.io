            <h2>Stock Market Optimism Hinges on Further Tariff Retreat, Analyst Argues</h2>

            <p>According to a Vox senior correspondent, the stock market's recent rally following President Trump's partial tariff retreat depends on the assumption that he will continue to moderate his trade policies. The current 10% universal tariff, combined with the decoupling of the US and Chinese economies, is already considered a worst-case scenario. The analyst warns that if Trump maintains his current course, the US will face surging prices and a heightened risk of recession, but if he continues to retreat, the economy could improve. The author notes the situation is uncertain, as Trump's views on trade make further negotiations difficult.</p>

            <p>United Airlines and Microchip Technology experienced significant stock reversals following President Trump's temporary tariff pause, as investors reacted positively to the shift in trade policy. The move comes after concerns that a global trade war would negatively impact consumer confidence and spending, which had previously led Delta Air Lines to withhold its full-year financial guidance. Chris Brigati of SWBC noted that the market's upward movement reflects a desire for clarity on tariff policy and the potential for constructive developments in the ongoing trade war.

            <p>The UK government is reportedly considering purchasing coking coal to sustain steel production at British Steel in Scunthorpe, following warnings that raw material supplies are dwindling. This offer is a short-term measure to buy time for negotiations with British Steel's Chinese owner, Jingye, regarding the plant's future. With Jingye stating that the furnaces are "no longer financially sustainable", talks are ongoing, and the government has not ruled out nationalizing British Steel. The immediate concern is securing the necessary raw materials to prevent a shutdown of the plant.</p>

            <p>Apple's stock experienced its best day since 1998, surging 15% after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs that would have affected the company's production in Vietnam, India, and Thailand. The rally added over $400 billion to Apple's market capitalization, bringing it close to $3 trillion. While most of Apple's iPhones are still made in China, which was not exempt from the tariff pause, the tariff reductions on Vietnam and India could allow Apple to serve a larger percentage of its U.S. customers from factories outside of China.</p>

The author highlights the awkward positions these commentators are left in after Trump pauses some tariffs, having previously defended the policies as necessary for America's economic well-being. The article satirizes the various arguments used to support the tariffs, such as the claim that they are "for the children" or that Trump's wealth guarantees his economic competence. The author argues that these justifications prioritize loyalty over logic and fail to address the real-world consequences of the tariffs.</p>

At the same time, he's increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the universal tariff rate for the next 90 days will be 10% for virtually all countries, with the exception of China. Mr. Trump wrote: "Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately."</p>

            <p>The Atlantic argues that President Trump's tariff policies, despite a recent pause, are detrimental to the American economy. The article suggests that the whiplash on rates is having its own effects. Other countries are putting retaliatory tariffs on American goods, which will translate into falling sales for domestic exporters. Moreover, uncertainty is dampening business spending. The country's economy is weakening, and the possibility of a recession remains.</p>
