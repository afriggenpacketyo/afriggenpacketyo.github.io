          <p>A 61-year-old man in New York has died from a "medical episode" after being violently pulled into a running MRI machine. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metal chain used for weight training when he entered the scanning room without authorization to assist his wife. MRI machines use powerful magnets that attract metallic objects, creating extreme danger if safety protocols are not followed. This tragic incident is now under investigation by local police, highlighting the critical importance of removing all metal before entering an MRI environment.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has stated that online abuse targeting female football players is increasing as the sport gains popularity. Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation of receiving racist messages during Euro 2025, which has prompted a police investigation. Bronze noted that while criticism is part of the sport, abuse is not, and that women's football seems to be a particular target for online harassment. The Lionesses squad has decided to stop taking a knee before games, seeking a new method to combat racism, and continues to advocate for more accountability from social media platforms.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old Canadian girl, initially reported as kidnapped by her father in upstate New York, has been found dead. The father, Luciano Frattolin, had claimed his daughter Melina was abducted at a rest stop, which triggered an Amber Alert. However, New York State Police later announced there was no abduction and noted inconsistencies in the father's story, shifting the focus of the investigation to him. The case is now being treated as a homicide, and authorities have stated there is no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, compounding its minority status in the lower house. The defeat comes amid public frustration over inflation, political scandals, and the rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which advocates a "Japanese First" platform. Despite the major electoral setback, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to manage critical trade negotiations with the United States. This marks the first time since 1955 that the Liberal Democratic Party has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.</p>

          <p>An opinion article warns that a new form of tyranny is emerging in Syria under its Islamist-led interim government, citing recent reports of sectarian violence against Christian and Druze minorities. The author, a Syrian-American physician, differentiates between Islam and the political ideology of Islamism, which he equates to fascism cloaked in religious language. The piece calls for international action, including accountability for the new regime and recognition of religious freedom as a fundamental human right, to prevent further atrocities and the consolidation of another authoritarian rule.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints regarding issues like leaks and incorrect billing. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces public anger over rising bills and record levels of sewage discharge into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog will have legal powers to protect customers, bringing the water industry's consumer protection in line with other utilities like energy and telecommunications.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that despite a recent diplomatic visit by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to China, Australia is sending mixed signals that could sabotage its own efforts to improve bilateral ties. While Chinese media focused on the positive aspects of the visit, Australian media and opposition figures were more critical, with some suggesting China was trying to create a divide between Australia and the US. The article suggests that by simultaneously seeking Chinese investment while publicly posturing about national security threats, such as the Darwin Port, Australia undermines its reliability as a partner in the eyes of Beijing.</p>

Bass criticized the use of masked federal agents and the deployment of the National Guard as unnecessary and punitive.

          <p>Intense rainfall and flash flooding in Montgomery County, Maryland, led to a surge of emergency calls, with officials reporting over 100 water rescues in just a two-hour period on Saturday. The National Weather Service issued its first-ever flash flood emergency for the D.C. area as some local creeks rose by 10 feet in 30 minutes. Numerous people were trapped in cars and buildings, including 20 patrons in a Chevy Chase building who were rescued by park police. While no serious injuries were initially reported, the rapid and severe flooding shocked many longtime residents.</p>

          <p>Bedouin fighters in southern Syria have agreed to a ceasefire but have not ruled out resuming clashes with the local Druze community in the city of Suweida. After a week of deadly sectarian violence that also involved government forces and Israeli air strikes, Bedouin fighters have retreated but are demanding the release of their injured members still in the city, whom they consider hostages. The conflict, which has killed over 1,120 people and displaced 128,000, erupted from long-standing tensions, and a fragile calm currently holds as a government-brokered ceasefire is tested.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he may block a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a series of social media posts, Trump called for the team to "IMMEDIATELY change their name back," claiming there is significant public demand for the restoration. The team dropped the name in 2020 following pressure from sponsors and Native American groups who view it as a slur. The proposed stadium site is on federal land, giving the president potential leverage over the deal.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy described his week at The Open at Royal Portrush as having "everything I wanted... apart from a Claret Jug." Despite finishing seven shots behind winner Scottie Scheffler, McIlroy was met with an incredibly emotional and supportive reception from the home crowd. He embraced the adoration, a contrast to his more isolated approach in 2019, and acknowledged that while his play had highs and lows, Scheffler's performance was simply on another level. McIlroy now looks ahead to the Ryder Cup, feeling reset after his time in Europe and praising Portrush as a top-tier Open venue.</p>

He cited past and present aides like Hope Hicks, Alina Habba, and Margo Martin as examples of this trend he observed during his time covering the White House.

He clarified that smaller nations in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa would likely face a baseline tariff of 10%, while larger economies will either have to open their markets to the U.S. or pay a higher rate.
