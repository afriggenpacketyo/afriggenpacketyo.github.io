          <p>A bomb exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulting in one death and at least four injuries, with the FBI declaring the incident an intentional act of terrorism. The explosion, which occurred in or near a vehicle parked by the clinic, caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering windows and creating a debris field extending several blocks. Authorities have identified a person of interest and are conducting a large-scale investigation to determine if the act was domestic or international terrorism. The clinic reported no staff were harmed and eggs/embryos remained secure, while Planned Parenthood closed nearby health centers as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Michael Gove, a former Conservative minister, stated that another Scottish independence referendum could be considered if there is overwhelming public support, echoing sentiments from SNP leader John Swinney. Gove emphasized that politicians must continually demonstrate the UK union is working, focusing on the economy, health, and transport to retain public confidence. He also defended the UK government's veto of Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform bill, citing the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex under the Equality Act. While acknowledging past disagreements with Scottish government ministers, Gove stressed the importance of cordial and productive relations between the UK and Scotland.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but limited its use to adults over 65 and individuals over 12 with medical conditions that increase their risk from COVID-19. This decision contrasts with the broader approvals of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, raising concerns about access for healthy individuals under 65 and potentially limiting options for those seeking the vaccine to protect vulnerable loved ones. The approval requires Novavax to conduct studies on heart conditions linked to the vaccine, potentially costing tens of millions of dollars. Experts express confusion over the new criteria and worry that the restrictions could make vaccines less available and more expensive.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility and prompting warnings from the National Weather Service. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms and exceptionally dry soil conditions, created a dramatic scene in Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. This event marks the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville issued a dust storm warning for Chicago, reminiscent of dust storms during the Dust Bowl era. Meteorologists attribute the storm's intensity to extremely dry soil moisture levels, making the area prone to wind-blown dust.</p>

Inspired by his own battle with bowel cancer, Peters perfected a technique to capture birds in mid-flight, revealing a rainbow effect on their wings. His book, "Garden Safari," serves as a rallying cry to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens, emphasizing the importance of gardens for struggling species amidst climate change.</p>

          <p>Recent attacks between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region have brought the two nuclear powers to the brink of full-blown conflict, resulting in civilian casualties and escalating military actions. The conflict was triggered by a militant attack in India-administered Kashmir, leading to retaliatory missile strikes and drone attacks from both sides. Families living along the Line of Control reported deaths and destruction, while government insiders described a tense atmosphere in Delhi and Islamabad. A ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players ultimately de-escalated the situation, but the recent violence has shattered the sense of security in the region.</p>
