        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Democratic-led legislature has approved the first of three bills aimed at redrawing congressional maps, a direct response to Republican redistricting in Texas. The plan, dubbed the “election rigging response act,” could create up to five new Democratic seats in the U.S. House. This political maneuver, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, escalates a partisan battle over gerrymandering between the nation's two most populous states ahead of midterm elections. The proposal will now go to the state senate before being put to voters in a special election.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has publicly declared Beijing's firm support for New Delhi in opposition to aggressive U.S. tariff policies. Speaking at a summit, the envoy criticized the U.S. as a "bully" and called for collaboration between the two nations to uphold the multilateral trading system. This unusual display of solidarity occurs as both countries face significant economic pressure from the Trump administration's trade war. The move highlights shifting geopolitical alliances in response to U.S. economic strategies.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard issued a directive to the U.S. intelligence community to halt the sharing of information regarding Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations with the "Five Eyes" alliance. This alliance includes the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The memo classified all related analysis as "NOFORN," meaning no foreign dissemination, a move that some former officials warn could erode trust and undermine the long-standing intelligence partnership. Other former officials contend that withholding sensitive information is a standard practice when national interests diverge.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium, where markets expect signals about a potential September interest rate cut. The address comes amid significant political pressure from the Trump administration, raising questions about the central bank's independence. Analysts will be closely watching Powell's characterization of the labor market and inflation, as well as any discussion on the Fed's long-term policy framework. The speech is viewed as a critical moment that could shape near-term market sentiment and the Fed's future policy trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising national credit card debt and high interest rates, debt forgiveness programs offer a potential solution for some struggling consumers. This article outlines the typical qualifications for such programs, which involve negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount. Generally, candidates must have substantial unsecured debt (often over $7,500), be facing verifiable financial hardship, and be delinquent or at risk of falling behind on payments. While this path can provide significant relief, it can also negatively impact credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a multi-million dollar federal grant for a California sex education program after the state refused to remove references to gender identity and transgender people from its curriculum. The Administration for Children and Families argued such topics were outside the scope of the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP). California officials contended the materials are medically accurate and legally sound, but their refusal to comply led to the loss of funding.

The primary motivations cited are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes, as kids' meals are typically less expensive. This consumer behavior comes as some restaurant chains report slowing sales, potentially due to economic pressures on low-income households. The trend suggests diners are actively seeking value and simplicity in response to rising costs, turning to options traditionally reserved for children.</p>

This approach, exemplified by officials endorsing specific candidates in Germany and Poland, is creating deep friction and undermining the traditional transatlantic alliance.

          <p>Chipotle is launching a pilot program for drone food delivery in the Dallas area through a partnership with autonomous logistics company Zipline. A select group of customers will be able to order from the menu via the Zipline app, with an autonomous aircraft delivering the food to their homes. The drones fly at 300 feet and lower a small robotic "Zip" to the ground to complete the delivery. This initiative, dubbed "Zipotle," represents the fast-casual chain's latest effort to innovate its delivery options and appeal to a younger, tech-savvy consumer base amid slowing industry sales.</p>

          <p>The hairstylist who sued Fox Sports host Skip Bayless for making unwanted sexual advances has requested to have her lawsuit dismissed, signaling that a settlement has likely been reached. The plaintiff, Noushin Faraji, also accused other executives at the network of creating a toxic workplace. The court initially rejected the dismissal request because the lawsuit included a class-action component alleging unfair labor practices by Fox against other employees. Legal experts suggest the case will be resolved once the individual complaint is separated from the class action, likely with a non-disclosure agreement.</p>

          <p>A Justice Department attorney has confirmed in a letter that the department will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, made by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, accuses Cook of potential mortgage fraud related to claims about her primary residence. In the letter, the DOJ attorney urged Fed Chair Jerome Powell to fire Cook, an action Powell does not have the authority to take. The investigation intensifies political pressure on the Federal Reserve, with President Trump also calling for Cook's resignation.</p>

The stories, published under the byline "Margaux Blanchard," were taken down after an editor at another publication grew suspicious of a pitch and found that sources and locations in previously published articles were unverifiable. The incident highlights the growing challenge media outlets face in detecting sophisticated AI-generated content and maintaining editorial standards in the face of this new technology.</p>

          <p>The new Democratic-backed congressional redistricting map in California would result in significant divisions of cities and counties, which Republicans are calling blatant gerrymandering. For example, the city of Lodi would be split among three different congressional districts, while some Sacramento suburbs would be moved into a Republican-held district, altering its political makeup. GOP leaders argue the plan is designed to dilute Republican votes and could cost up to five of the party's incumbents their seats. The unusual shapes of the proposed districts are being criticized as politically motivated rather than representative of community interests.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick in sales coincided with a 15.7% year-over-year increase in the number of homes for sale, the highest inventory level since May 2020. The additional supply is helping to ease pressure on prices, with the median home price showing only a slight 0.2% annual increase.
