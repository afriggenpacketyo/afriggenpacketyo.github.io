          <h2>Study Predicts Increased Ice Jams in China's Yellow River Due to Climate Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 02:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that global warming will lead to more frequent ice jams in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of the century, impacting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. As warmer weather breaks up upstream ice, it drifts downstream and refreezes in colder areas, forming ice jams that can cause destructive flooding. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam flood dynamics and found that climate warming is shifting the geographic distribution of these hotspots downstream. The Yellow River, while historically significant, has also been a source of devastating floods, and this trend is expected to continue with increasing frequency due to climate change. This localized hazard will likely affect communities, wildlife, and infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering case continues with testimony from "Jane," Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who detailed her relationship with him from 2021 to 2024, including allegations of forced participation in "hotel nights" involving sex with male escorts while Diddy watched. Legal experts suggest her testimony, similar to Cassie Ventura's, could be interpreted in multiple ways by the jury, potentially raising questions about her motives and the consensual nature of the acts. Jane also testified about Diddy's reaction to the release of the Cassie Ventura assault video and an alleged violent altercation in June 2024. Despite Diddy paying for Jane's lawyer, her testimony provides insights into the power dynamics and alleged coercion within their relationship. The article suggests that the jury must decide whether Diddy's conduct was criminal, given that the conduct itself isn't disputed.</p>

This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. The action underscores Taiwan's commitment to addressing national security concerns related to arms proliferation activities, and could impact the global semiconductor supply chain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be exported to England daily after a landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) takes effect at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges that there are not enough incinerators to meet the increased demand, leading to a "capacity gap" estimated at 600,000 tonnes in the first year of the ban. This move raises concerns about increased emissions from transporting waste and the environmental impact of landfilling in England. The long-term strategy to reduce waste generation has seen limited success, with domestic recycling rates barely improving over the past decade.</p>

The protests, which also took place in other Spanish cities, Venice, and Lisbon, aimed to highlight the negative impacts of overtourism on residents' lives. In Barcelona, residents say rent has increased significantly due to short-term rentals, and traditional stores are being replaced by businesses catering to tourists. While some tourists laughed off the water blasts, the protests underscore growing discontent with the economic model that prioritizes tourism over the well-being of local communities.</p>

The operation aims to provide justice for victims whose cases have not progressed through the criminal justice system and prevent further harm to children. This initiative follows the upcoming release of a report by Baroness Louise Casey on group-based child sexual abuse and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's announcement of a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs covering England and Wales. The Home Office seeks to end the culture of denial in local services and authorities about the prevalence of this crime.</p>

          <p>Nesrine Malik argues that Israel's actions in Gaza have damaged its international reputation, and the recent attacks on Iran are a belated and dangerous attempt to restore it. The author contends that the Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, is exploiting the conflict to bolster his political career and divert attention from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This strategy risks further destabilizing the region and undermining the trust of key allies. The analysis suggests that Israel's actions are driven by domestic politics and a desire to maintain its image, rather than genuine security concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump's proposed "revenge tax" could deter foreign investment in the U.S. The provision, Section 899 of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would allow the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. individuals and companies. This could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe haven status. Some UK companies, heavily exposed to the U.S. market, might consider redomiciling in New York to avoid the tax. The bill has passed the House and awaits Senate approval.</p>

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, designed to help people get on the property ladder, are facing increasing discontent, with complaints about repairs, costs, and selling soaring. Shared ownership involves buying a share of a property and paying rent on the remainder, but many find themselves trapped with few homeowner rights and significant renter obligations. Complaints to the housing watchdog have risen nearly 400% in the past five years, with common issues including high service charges, slow repairs, and difficulties selling the property. The Housing Ombudsman has urged the government to address fundamental inequities in the system.</p>

This silence is seen as ungrateful and disrespectful, particularly given the team's large Latino following and their historical connection to the community through players like Fernando Valenzuela.

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer, which represents a substantial premium over Santos' previous closing price, has led the company's board to indicate its intention to recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction. This takeover bid follows unsuccessful attempts in the past, and it would grant the consortium control of key liquefied natural gas operations in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The acquisition of Santos would give the consortium control of two Australian liquefied natural gas operations â€“ Gladstone LNG on the east coast and Darwin LNG in the north of Australia â€“ as well as stakes in PNG LNG and the undeveloped Papua LNG.</p>

Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in May, exceeding analysts' expectations. However, industrial output slowed, and fixed-asset investment growth also fell short of forecasts. The property market continues to contract, with new home prices declining in major cities. Analysts call for stronger policy support to sustain the recovery, as falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>
