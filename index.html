          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce the majority of newly imposed tariffs on each other's imports and temporarily suspend some reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. has decreased tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China has lowered its tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. However, both nations will retain a portion of their earlier tariffs, subject to further negotiations, and China has committed to suspending non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals, as both sides aim to establish a consultation mechanism to address mutual economic and trade concerns.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees utilizing medicinal plants in diverse ways to treat injuries, building on prior findings of self-medication through plant consumption. The study recorded instances of chimps applying plants to their own wounds and, occasionally, to others, indicating a behavioral repertoire for hygiene and treatment. Scientists analyzed footage of a young chimpanzee tending to its mother's injury and observed chimps caring for unrelated individuals, suggesting empathy. The team also studied decades of anecdotal evidence from a field station logbook, which described leaf-dabbing on injuries and chimps helping others remove snares, with previous research identifying plants with antibacterial properties used by chimps.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which cater to the ultra-rich with personalized wealth management services, are experiencing rapid growth but are struggling to recruit and retain qualified money managers. Deloitte estimates that the number of family offices will increase to 10,720 by 2030, managing $5.4 trillion in assets; however, McKinsey projects a potential shortage of 100,000 wealth advisors by 2034. Family offices face competition from banks and private equity firms and often prioritize trust over expertise when hiring. Some families are willing to pay a salary premium to secure trusted employees, while young professionals may find family offices less appealing due to unclear corporate structures and career progression.</p>

The complaint questions air traffic control's response and runway construction, while investigations continue into the cause, including a possible bird strike.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria, ahead of a planned meeting with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia. The decision was celebrated in Damascus as a pivotal turning point for the country, which has struggled with poverty and instability since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Al-Sharaa has called for the de-listing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization and promised to protect ethnic minorities, though recent clashes have raised concerns. The sanctions had previously blocked foreign financing, including aid, from reaching Syria and were originally intended to put pressure on the dictatorship of now-ousted President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

          <p>China has reiterated its territorial claims near the contested border with India by publishing "standard" names for dozens of locations in Arunachal Pradesh, which China refers to as Zangnan. The Ministry of Civil Affairs released names for 27 geographical features, including mountains, residential areas, and mountain passes, in Chinese, Tibetan, and pinyin, accompanied by coordinates and maps. This action occurs despite recent efforts to improve relations between the two countries following tensions, including a deadly military clash in 2020 and a border skirmish in 2021, though a military stand-off at the Himalayan border ended late last year.</p>

          <p>Iran has suggested establishing a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to dismantling its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the proposal to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, envisioning Iran enriching uranium to a low grade for civilian use in other Arab countries, with international oversight. This plan, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, would be permanent and include on-the-ground representatives, potentially from the U.S., offering greater oversight. While some see this as a new approach to break the impasse, the feasibility of such a venture involving regional rivals like Saudi Arabia and the UAE remains uncertain.</p>

China aims to present itself as a stable alternative amidst global trade policy upheaval, but will not concede on sovereignty disputes.

In contrast, Japan ranks first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills, leading to an overall ranking of 14th. Experts suggest that there is a lack of awareness about children's mental health issues in Japan, rendering government measures ineffective, and highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's well-being.</p>

He also addressed speculation about Biden's cognitive decline, stating that he found Biden to be sharp and effective during their time working together. Buttigieg's visit to Iowa has fueled speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, as he recently declined a Senate run in Michigan and has increased his media appearances.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over 35 years for the 1989 murders of their parents. Judge Michael Jesic reduced their sentences following emotional statements from the brothers and testimony from family members, who emphasized their rehabilitation and remorse. The decision was influenced by letters from prison guards and their accomplishments while incarcerated, including educational courses and programs for inmates. The parole process will be lengthy, with a hearing scheduled next month, and Governor Newsom could also grant clemency.</p>

          <p>President Trump's public statements about U.S. mediation efforts between India and Pakistan have stirred political sensitivities in India, straining relations despite a recent cease-fire. Trump's claims of influencing the cease-fire through trade offers and threats were directly contradicted by Indian officials, who emphasized that the issue of trade never arose during discussions. The unease in New Delhi stems from concerns about India being perceived as halting military action under external pressure, potentially undermining Prime Minister Modi's standing. Trump's equal treatment of India and Pakistan and his offer to mediate on Kashmir have further aggravated Indian leaders.</p>

          <p>State Farm will be allowed to temporarily increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California following approval from the state's insurance commissioner, after the catastrophic fires. The insurer had requested an emergency rate increase, citing financial strain, following extensive damage from recent wildfires. Consumer Watchdog criticized the decision, alleging that State Farm has exaggerated its financial difficulties and delayed or lowballed claims, while the insurance commissioner framed the increase as a difficult compromise to address a statewide insurance crisis. The interim rates will take effect on June 1, with a further hearing scheduled to assess State Farm's financial health.</p>

The bill includes stricter paperwork requirements, changes to federal funding for states, and a work requirement for Medicaid enrollees, with Democrats arguing that the proposed changes would cause millions to lose insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals of food shortage warnings, an internal Israeli analysis suggests that Palestinians in Gaza face widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are promptly restored. Military officials have warned commanders that many areas will soon lack minimum daily nutritional needs due to the blockade, with immediate action needed to reinstate the aid supply system. This assessment contrasts with Israel's public stance, which has maintained that the blockade did not pose a major threat, even as aid agencies warned of famine. The UN Security Council has called on Israel to allow aid into Gaza, and a Trump administration plan to distribute food through private organizations has been criticized for increasing risks to civilians.</p>
