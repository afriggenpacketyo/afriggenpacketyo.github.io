          <p>The U.S. economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, falling well below forecasts and raising concerns about the health of the labor market amid new tariff implementations. Compounding the issue, job figures for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, revealing that hiring was substantially weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%, with long-term unemployment also rising, suggesting a persistent cooling trend. This slowdown puts pressure on the Federal Reserve and highlights economic challenges facing firms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's stock fell approximately 7% despite reporting second-quarter results that largely surpassed expectations. The decline was driven by a weaker-than-anticipated profit forecast and investor concerns about the growth rate of its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals like Microsoft and Google. The company highlighted a significant increase in capital expenditures, primarily for building out AI infrastructure, but questions remain about when these investments will translate into profit. Despite strong retail and advertising sales, the focus remains on cloud market share and future profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fact-check investigation by DW has revealed that Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI, has been repeatedly providing false information regarding viral images of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In multiple instances, Grok incorrectly claimed that recent photos of malnourished Gazan children were actually from older conflicts in Iraq and Yemen. These false verifications were then amplified by users on X, undermining reports of the severe food shortages in the region. The analysis highlights the dangers of relying on AI tools for rapid fact-checking in sensitive and fast-moving situations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff visited a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid distribution site to assess the humanitarian situation. Huckabee stated the U.S.-backed program is effectively getting food to people by bypassing Hamas, which he accused of looting aid and creating a black market. The visit comes as the Trump administration's messaging on the crisis appears to shift, with President Trump acknowledging "real starvation in Gaza." The GHF's operations remain controversial, with the UN and other groups criticizing the safety and efficacy of its distribution methods.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in Mount Airy, Maryland, has died after being trapped in a storm drain during severe flooding that drenched the U.S. East Coast. The boy was playing in the rain when he was swept into a pipe by rushing floodwaters; rescue attempts were initially thwarted by the strong water pressure. The heavy rainfall caused widespread disruption, with parts of the Baltimore area receiving up to six inches of rain, leading to flooded roads and car rescues. The storm system also caused significant flooding and transportation shutdowns in the New York metropolitan area.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his public attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, demanding an immediate and substantial cut in interest rates. In a series of social media posts, Trump called Powell a "stubborn MORON" and suggested the Fed's board should overrule him, a move that challenges the central bank's traditional independence from political pressure. This criticism follows the Fed's decision to hold rates steady and coincides with a weak jobs report and the administration's rollout of new tariffs, which are creating economic uncertainty.

          <p>The English Football League has expressed growing concern over the viability of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. as the club faces a severe financial crisis under owner Dejphon Chansiri.

With the Championship season set to begin, the team has a depleted squad of only 14 players.

          <p>A 36-year-old worker at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo was killed after being attacked by a Sumatran tiger that had escaped its enclosure. The employee, identified as the head of the carnivores team, was preparing for a "behind-the-scenes tour" when the incident occurred in an inner courtyard. The zoo stated that visitors were never in physical danger as they were protected behind a glass window. The facility has been closed to the public while an investigation, in cooperation with Israeli police, is conducted to determine how the animal managed to escape.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Modernize Ancient Chromium Technique to Double Artillery Barrel Lifespan</h2>

          <p>Researchers in China have significantly extended the service life of modern artillery barrels by adapting a 2,000-year-old anti-corrosion technology. The original technique, which involved a thin layer of chromium salts, was discovered on well-preserved bronze swords from the Terracotta Army of China's first emperor. Scientists have now refined this method to create a modern coating that combats the extreme heat and pressure inside cannon barrels. According to a defense journal, this upgraded chromium plating process effectively doubles the lifespan of the barrels by preventing erosion and microcracking.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 09:55:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book, law professor Corinna Barrett Lain argues that lethal injection, often perceived as a humane execution method, can cause immense suffering. Focusing on Tennessee's recent use of the single drug pentobarbital, Lain cites evidence that the chemical can induce a sensation akin to drowning or being buried alive for several minutes before death. The article discusses her research, which found that lethal injection protocols were not designed by medical experts and that the process is often botched. It also touches on the high financial and emotional costs of capital punishment.</p>

          <p>Qatar may redirect its liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports away from Europe if the EU proceeds with a new corporate sustainability directive. The law requires companies to scrutinize their supply chains for human rights and environmental abuses, with heavy fines for noncompliance. Qatari authorities argue the directive's climate rules are overly burdensome and pose a risk to its state-owned energy giant. This threat jeopardizes a key 2022 deal to supply Germany with LNG, a pact that was crucial for reducing Europe's reliance on Russian gas following the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil's second-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates, even as profits declined 23% from the previous year due to lower oil prices. The company's strong performance was driven by its highest second-quarter production in over 25 years, with record output from the Permian Basin and Guyana. Exxon also highlighted its successful cost-cutting measures, having slashed $13.5 billion in expenses since 2019. The oil major continued its robust shareholder return program, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her first interview since losing the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she currently has no desire to re-enter what she described as a "broken" system of American politics. Harris, who recently declined to run for governor of California, explained that she believes the systems meant to defend democratic principles are not as strong as they need to be. She expressed that she did not predict the level of "capitulation" from those who should be guardians of democracy, and plans to spend time traveling the country and listening to people.</p>
