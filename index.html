          <p>A 26-year-old Chinese woman is missing after being swept away by severe floodwaters in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, Australia. The incident occurred when she and a 27-year-old companion attempted to drive through a flooded area, causing their vehicle to become stranded. While the other woman was rescued unharmed, the 26-year-old was carried off by the current as they tried to exit the car. China's Consulate General in Sydney has urged local authorities to deploy maximum resources in the ongoing search and rescue operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue aggressive saving and frugal living to exit the workforce decades ahead of schedule. Proponents, like Nik and Adinah Johnson who retired in their forties, emphasize consuming less and investing wisely to achieve financial freedom. The core principle, popularized by books like "Your Money or Your Life," involves saving 25 times one's annual expenses to live off a 4% annual withdrawal. This lifestyle prioritizes personal freedom and time over material possessions, fundamentally changing one's relationship with money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for most of Scotland ahead of Storm Floris, which is expected to bring unusually strong winds on Monday. Gusts could reach 70 mph inland and up to 90 mph in exposed coastal areas, posing a danger to life and risking damage to buildings and infrastructure. A less severe yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. Authorities are urging caution, particularly for travelers, as the storm's timing during the holiday season could catch many unaware, with significant disruptions expected for rail and ferry services.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across the region, including parts of New York City and western Connecticut. The tremor occurred Saturday night, marking the second seismic event in the state in less than two weeks. While no immediate damage was reported, officials have advised residents to be aware of potential aftershocks and inspect for any structural issues. This event follows a series of smaller quakes in Morris Plains and a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2024, both linked to the active Ramapo Fault line in northern New Jersey.</p>

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene, while the passenger was hospitalized. The National Park Service is investigating the incident and using it as a reminder for drivers to exercise extreme caution, especially at night, due to the presence of large wildlife on Alaskan roadways.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that focusing on individual high-profile cases like those of Jeffrey Epstein, Sean Combs, and Harvey Weinstein obscures the pervasive nature of violence against women. The author contends that this violence is a systemic issue rooted in misogyny, not a series of isolated incidents, and compares the lack of systemic recognition to not having a word for cancer. According to the CDC, a woman is beaten by an intimate partner every nine seconds in the US, and a sexual assault occurs every 68 seconds, illustrating the scale of a problem that shapes the lives of all women.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the league's highest-paid players, recently stated that he does not know his exact net worth and prefers not to focus on it. Instead, Curry emphasizes creating a portfolio of investments and opportunities that he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day financial management to his team. Financial planners suggest this is a healthy approach, as focusing on tangible goals and values-driven decisions can be more rewarding than fixating on a single number. Experts advise that understanding cash flow and setting meaningful personal milestones are more powerful indicators of financial well-being.</p>

          <p>Federal and state authorities in Minnesota are investigating a massive fraud scheme targeting the state's Housing Stabilization Services (HSS), a Medicaid program for seniors and people with disabilities. An investigation uncovered that numerous HSS providers were fraudulently billing Medicaid for millions of dollars in services that were never delivered to recipients. Raids were conducted at eight locations, and stop-payment orders have been issued for suspect companies. This case highlights a larger, ongoing problem of healthcare fraud, which costs U.S. taxpayers billions annually and has prompted calls for stricter oversight and provider vetting.</p>

          <p>Frustration over officiating is growing within the WNBA, with prominent players like Kelsey Plum and Angel Reese publicly criticizing what they see as inconsistent and unreliable calls. Despite the backlash, the league's head of referee development, Monty McCutchen, expressed overall satisfaction with the referees' work, pointing to a detailed internal review process. However, the WNBA's officiating structure relies on part-time referees who also work other leagues, lacks a centralized replay center, and shuffles crews, which critics argue contributes to a lack of cohesion and consistency on the court.</p>

          <p>In a 2017 interview, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz discussed the 1976-77 shooting spree that terrorized New York City, for which he is serving six life sentences. Berkowitz, now a born-again Christian, described his past self as walking in darkness and controlled by demonic forces, expressing regret for his actions. He spoke of a troubled childhood and struggles with depression, but stated he now finds refuge in his faith and works to encourage young people to avoid a similar path. While he takes responsibility, he also alluded to the involvement of a satanic cult, a claim law enforcement has consistently dismissed.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has replaced a clean energy advocate on the state's public utilities commission, drawing criticism from environmental groups who claim the move was influenced by utility giant DTE Energy.

Her replacement, Shaquila Myers, is described by critics as an 'industry ally' with ties to pro-business politicians. The appointment comes at a critical time, as the commission is considering over $1 billion in proposed rate increases and long-term energy plans for the state.</p>

          <p>In an op-ed, a senior UN aid official describes the devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, attributing it to Israel's deliberate obstruction of aid and collective punishment of the Palestinian people. The official recounts witnessing starvation, a crumbling health system, and daily killings, which they describe as 'conditions created to kill.' After speaking out about these conditions, the official's visa was not renewed, which they claim is part of a broader pattern by Israeli authorities to silence humanitarian workers, journalists, and NGOs. The article argues that aid is being systematically blocked, not failing to be collected, and calls for an end to the occupation.</p>

This shift could reshape global development, potentially leading to a more collaborative and less paternalistic model.

This role offers a stark contrast to his robotic efficiency in tournaments, which can sometimes diminish viewing excitement.
