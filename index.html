          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, has been taken into custody near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County. Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed in their Brooklyn Park home, while state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were shot in their Champlin home; the Hoffmans are recovering after surgery. Authorities issued shelter-in-place orders during the 24-hour manhunt, and officials expressed gratitude for the arrest, hoping Boelter will face justice for the horrific crimes. Gov. Tim Walz has called Hortman's death a "political assassination" and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. </p>

          <p>A suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, is in custody following targeted shootings that resulted in the death of Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and injuries to State Sen. John Hoffman and their respective spouses. The shootings, described by Gov. Tim Walz as "politically motivated," occurred at the lawmakers' homes in Brooklyn Park and Champlin. Boelter, who served on a state board with Hoffman, was apprehended after authorities found his vehicle and investigated whether the suspect knew the victims personally. Authorities found a document in Boelter's vehicle that named other lawmakers and officials, and a stack of "No Kings" flyers was also found inside the vehicle.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones, citing concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstructed natural light. Some projects have been scrapped due to this opposition, as locals describe the facilities as imposing and "eerie." Tech companies are investing heavily in these digital hubs to meet the growing demands of cloud computing and AI, but they face challenges in finding suitable sites in Japan. Some municipalities are responding by implementing stricter regulations, while industry groups emphasize the importance of building trust with affected communities.</p>

          <p>An internet outage affecting parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties was caused by apparent would-be copper thieves who cut through fiber-optic cables in Van Nuys. Spectrum confirmed the incident, stating that the vandals were seeking copper in cables that do not contain it. The company had to make thousands of fiber splices to restore services, a time-consuming process. Spectrum is working with the LAPD and offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to an arrest, as such incidents are affecting the entire telecommunications industry due to the rising price of precious metals.</p>

Israel stated it launched a "targeted military operation" against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program, while the U.S. clarified it was not involved in the strikes.

Maresca coached Delap previously at Manchester City's academy, which helped convince him to sign with Chelsea despite interest from other clubs. Chelsea intends to sign another winger after sending Jadon Sancho back to Manchester United, and they are interested in Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays and the government's consumer goods trade-in program. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates, while industrial output growth slowed slightly. Fixed-asset investment expanded, but property investment continued to contract, and the urban unemployment rate eased to its lowest level since November. The rise in retail sales came as a surprise and was likely boosted by the consumer goods trade-in program, but falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Minnesota lawmakers were targeted in shootings, with State Representative Melissa Hortman killed and State Senator John Hoffman injured. Police have identified Vance Luther Boelter as the suspect, who remains at large. Boelter was once a member of the same state workforce development board as Hoffman. Investigators reportedly found a list of 70 "targets", including the names of state Democratic politicians, in a vehicle the suspect drove for the assassination. Boelter is a security contractor and religious missionary who has worked in Africa and the Middle East, according to an online CV.</p>

While Trump has touted trillions of dollars in committed investment, the data is still preliminary and may not fully reflect his policies. Many investment plans were already in the works before Trump took office, and some companies have expressed concerns about potential negative impacts from his policies. Economists suggest that uncertainty may be hindering investment, and some announcements may be exaggerated for political reasons. (not investment advice)</p>
