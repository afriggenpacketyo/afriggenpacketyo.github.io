          <p>Police have identified Robin Westman, 23, as the suspect in a tragic Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuries to 17 others. Westman, who died by self-inflicted gunshot, was a former student at the Annunciation Catholic School, where her mother also previously worked. Investigators are examining online videos and journals that depict a "deranged obsession" with past mass shooters and a deeply nihilistic worldview, as they work to uncover a motive for this incomprehensible act of violence. Authorities confirmed the weapons were legally purchased recently, and Westman had no known extensive criminal history or prior mental health commitments.</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its second fiscal quarter, driven by strong sales in mobile phones, video gaming (including the Nintendo Switch 2 launch), and computing. Despite this recovery, the retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing ongoing uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. CEO Corie Barry noted that while customers are resilient, they remain deal-focused, and the company is innovating with a new third-party marketplace and in-store experiences to spur growth. The company's net income, however, decreased year-over-year, reflecting a challenging economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

Sophia, who was in her first week of seventh grade, underwent emergency surgery and faces a long, uncertain recovery.

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has controversially banned the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, from speaking to him or his councillors. This unprecedented ban, which also affects BBC-funded local democracy reporters, stems from a disagreement over a story about local government reorganization. Barton stated the move is to prevent "misinformation" and uphold "responsibility and honesty," while the newspaper's editor called it a "direct attack on the free press" and the ability to hold elected officials accountable. The decision has drawn strong criticism from other political parties, who view it as a dangerous step against local journalism and public scrutiny.</p>

          <h2>Key Questions to Consider Before Filing for Bankruptcy Amid Rising Filings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 11:53:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US bankruptcy filings surged by 11.5% in the past year, with individual filings increasing by 11.8% in June, reflecting widespread financial struggles due to medical emergencies, job losses, and inflation. Before considering bankruptcy, individuals should carefully assess whether it will truly eliminate their specific debts, as student loans, recent tax debts, and child support are typically not discharged. The article advises exploring less damaging alternatives like debt consolidation, credit counseling, or direct negotiation with creditors. It also stresses understanding the long-term consequences on credit, employment, housing, and future borrowing ability, which can significantly impact one's financial future for years.

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have initiated the process to restore major UN sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, as tensions escalate over Tehran's nuclear program. This "snapback mechanism" could reimpose sanctions in 30 days, triggered by Iran's "clear and deliberate" non-compliance, including its high enriched uranium stockpile. Iran's foreign ministry called the move a "provocative and unnecessary escalation" that would undermine ongoing talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Western powers remain unconvinced of Iran's purely peaceful nuclear intentions, while Iran insists its program is solely civilian, creating a diplomatic impasse.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai, 77, has concluded his trial on charges of "colluding with foreign forces" and "publishing seditious materials" under Beijing's controversial national security law. Lai, held since 2020 after his Apple Daily newspaper was forced to close, could face a life sentence if convicted, symbolizing China's crackdown on dissent. Prosecutors cited 161 articles and Lai's public comments as evidence, while the defense argued his actions were exercises of free speech before the law took effect. The trial highlights a significant erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong, drawing international condemnation from leaders like Donald Trump and Keir Starmer.</p>

CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated the need for efficiency without relying solely on increased headcount, following previous layoffs and buyouts across various divisions. While some employees expressed concerns about job security and internal barriers, executives noted the voluntary exit program has been "quite successful" for those seeking career breaks.</p>

This ambiguity, coupled with Trump's shifting stance on territorial concessions and security guarantees for Ukraine, has threatened to unravel diplomatic progress.

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods exceeded fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales expectations, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance, driven by strong comparable sales growth of 5%. Demand for new and innovative products, particularly from Nike's revamped running portfolio, contributed significantly to this performance. CEO Lauren Hobart noted no signs of consumer spending slowdown due to tariffs, which the company has offset with "surgical" price increases. The company's upcoming $2.4 billion acquisition of Foot Locker, expected to close in September, aims to make it the top athletic footwear seller in the U.S. and expand its global presence, despite Foot Locker's current struggles.

However, economists note that the overall strength was somewhat illusory, with average growth at only 1.4% for the first half of the year and underlying private-sector demand remaining weak outside of AI.
