          <p>Racquel "Kelly" Smith, along with her boyfriend and a friend, received life sentences in South Africa for kidnapping and trafficking her six-year-old daughter, Joshlin Smith, who disappeared in February 2024. Judge Nathan Erasmus emphasized the equal culpability of all three individuals in the crime. The sentencing followed a six-week trial filled with disturbing allegations, including claims that Smith sold her daughter to a traditional healer for her eyes and skin. Despite extensive searches, Joshlin remains missing, leaving her family devastated and pleading for her return; her grandmother voiced the family's broken state. The trial included testimonies from over 30 witnesses, detailing the child's troubled life and the manipulative nature of her mother.</p>

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife Frances have filed a $500 million defamation lawsuit against four former housekeepers who anonymously accused the singer of sexual assault. The Robinsons assert that the women fabricated the allegations as part of an "extortionate" lawsuit, claiming they treated the plaintiffs with "utmost kindness and generosity." The lawsuit also seeks to dismiss the women's case, arguing they should not have been granted anonymity. The women, who are of Hispanic descent, allege incidents dating back to 2006, citing fear of reprisal and immigration concerns as reasons for their delayed reporting. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has opened an investigation into the accusations.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets reacted favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocks President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. U.S. stock futures and oil prices rose, while the U.S. dollar strengthened against the yen and euro. The court determined that the 1977 Act does not authorize the use of tariffs, although the White House has appealed the decision. Investors seemed encouraged by the ruling, hoping it would alleviate months of market turmoil caused by Trump's trade war; this is in spite of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs.

          <p>English Premiership rugby is experiencing a significant shift as several long-standing players, including Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Ben Youngs, and Alex Goode, retire from the sport. These players, who were instrumental in England's victory over New Zealand in 2012, are now concluding their careers, marking the end of an era. Danny Care also bows out alongside these legends. The retirements reflect a changing landscape in rugby, with younger players increasingly taking the place of seasoned veterans.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to bolstering its advanced manufacturing sector, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. During a recent visit to Henan province, Xi emphasized that self-reliance in advanced manufacturing is crucial for China's economy. This push aligns with the "Made in China 2025" plan, which aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer. However, this strategy has drawn criticism from the U.S., which seeks to address trade imbalances and reduce state subsidies to Chinese companies, potentially leading to further friction in trade relations.</p>

          <p>Complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased fivefold over the past five years, according to the Housing Ombudsman. The watchdog attributes this rise to an "imbalance of power" between tenants and landlords, leading to "simmering anger" and a potential "managed decline" of social housing. Common complaints include issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control problems, and leaks, damp, and mold. The ombudsman calls for a "transformative overhaul" of the system, including a review of funding practices and the establishment of a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. court ruling that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is expected to explore alternative measures. The court blocked the 10% baseline tariff and additional tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, but not sectoral tariffs. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest the White House could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 for a swift replacement tariff or initiate Section 301 investigations. The administration's appeal process is underway, and the Supreme Court could ultimately decide the case. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has detailed its plans to reform the pension industry, including the creation of £25 billion "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth. The overhaul, inspired by Australian and Canadian pension investment funds, aims to improve returns for workers and increase investment in clean energy and high-growth businesses. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is including a legislative backstop for enforcement if necessary. The changes are expected to have significant implications for how pension schemes operate, potentially improving retirement outcomes through better governance and investment diversification.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of expected negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The company's global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles. While Toyota plans to absorb the tariff costs without passing them on to U.S. consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to adjust if the tariffs persist. Sales outside Japan rose by 9.7%, with a 10% increase in U.S. sales.</p>

The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics.</p>

          <p>A federal court in New York blocked President Donald Trump's plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world. The court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the sweeping tariffs. The tariffs overturned decades of U.S. trade policy and disrupted global commerce. The court's decision has been met with varied reactions, with the White House criticizing the ruling and global markets responding positively.</p>
