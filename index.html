        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey faces indictment for allegedly lying to Congress, a development critics view as more than mere personal retribution by President Trump. This action aligns with Trump's broader agenda, articulated after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, to pursue legal cases against individuals and organizations funding anti-Trump causes, including prominent liberal donors. This strategy is interpreted as a calculated effort to weaponize the justice system, suppress political dissent, and safeguard the administration from potential future accountability amidst declining approval ratings and economic concerns. The article suggests this represents a dangerous erosion of the rule of law, impacting fundamental rights to participate in free and fair elections.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 congressional testimony. The interim U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, who was installed at President Trump's direction after her predecessor resigned over objections to the case, stated the charges represent a significant breach of public trust. Comey, a frequent target of Trump's criticism, maintains his innocence, vowing to fight the charges and emphasizing the importance of civic engagement and voting. This indictment follows public complaints from Trump and has sparked condemnation from Democrats, raising serious concerns about potential political interference within the Department of Justice and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Todd West, convicted of a 1997 murder during a gas station robbery, was executed in Alabama using nitrogen gas, a method the state began last year. West offered an apology to the victim's family, and notably, the victim's son, Will Berry, had publicly urged the governor to commute West's sentence to life in prison, expressing his forgiveness and stating that taking another life would not help his family. Despite these heartfelt pleas, Governor Kay Ivey allowed the execution to proceed, citing her duty to uphold Alabama law. West's execution marks one of seven times nationally this method has been used, prompting broader reflections on capital punishment and the complex balance of justice, mercy, and the possibility of redemption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump issued a presidential memorandum establishing a comprehensive strategy to combat organized political violence and domestic terrorism, a move critics fear could lead to a broad crackdown on his political opponents. Trump explicitly suggested targeting funders of "radical leftwing" groups, naming individuals like George Soros and Reid Hoffman as potential targets. Civil liberties advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, condemned the memo, warning it could stigmatize non-profits and activists with the label of "domestic terrorism" and be used to target protected activities under the Bill of Rights. The initiative, championed by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, aims to use the full force of the federal government to dismantle what the administration describes as "leftwing terrorism" and its supporting organizations.</p>

He announced that the U.S. has already withheld its UN contribution this year and vowed to continue freezing funding until comprehensive reforms are implemented within the organization. Waltz criticized the UN's bloated bureaucracy, emphasizing the need for greater transparency and accountability before U.S. taxpayer money flows again, echoing past reform efforts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new wave of tariffs, including a 25% levy on imported heavy trucks, effective October 1st, as part of his broader initiative to boost domestic manufacturing. These new duties also include 100% tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture, all set to take effect from the same date. Trump stated these measures are necessary to protect U.S. manufacturers from "unfair outside competition" and address national security concerns. The decision follows recent investigations into imports of various goods, including robotics and medical devices, under a provision allowing tariffs on national security grounds.</p>

Green, whose firm Basis Capital invests in businesses that provide services to or compete with local government, is seeking access to sensitive council data. Local councillors have raised significant concerns about potential conflicts of interest, questioning whether businesses backed by Basis could gain an unfair advantage over competitors. Doge, launched to identify waste and inefficiencies and inspired by Elon Musk's efforts, has faced legal hurdles in accessing council data so far, making Green's role a potential model for gaining access to sensitive information at other councils.</p>

          <p>A California Senate bill, SB 576, aims to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, preventing them from being significantly louder than the main programming. This legislative effort, directly sparked by parents whose 8-month-old baby was repeatedly woken by blaring ads, seeks to extend federal CALM Act protections, which currently apply only to traditional broadcasters, to streaming platforms. Given California's substantial market influence, the passage of this bill could effectively set a national standard if signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. The Motion Picture Association has opposed the bill, citing complexities in managing ad volumes from various sources, but advocates argue streamers possess the technical capability.</p>

Milam maintained his innocence until the end, blaming his then-girlfriend and claiming she believed the child was demon-possessed. His execution proceeded after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected final appeals challenging the reliability of bite mark evidence and claims of intellectual disability.

This effect describes an "intense dance" where two tropical storms merge or spin around a newly formed, common center.

One 80-year-old victim recounted being ambushed by the squirrel, which prompted a neighborhood warning flyer about the "attack squirrel." While it is rare for squirrels to attack humans, experts from Marin Humane suggest this aggressive behavior likely stems from people hand-feeding or hand-raising the animal. This interaction causes the squirrel to lose its natural instinct to avoid humans and become aggressive when it expects food and doesn't receive it. This incident serves as a stark reminder against the dangers of feeding wildlife.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer identifies a stark divide in the current economy: a robust segment driven by the artificial intelligence boom, and a weaker consumer-oriented portion that he believes urgently needs interest rate cuts. Cramer notes that AI giants are making multi-billion-dollar deals and investments, like CoreWeave's expanded investment with OpenAI, and are largely indifferent to interest rates due to their capital access. Conversely, consumer-facing companies in sectors like autos, housing, and retail are struggling to meet estimates, with Starbucks even announcing store count reductions and layoffs. Cramer argues that despite strong GDP growth, its strength is concentrated in tech, creating a significant disconnect with the day-to-day lives of the workforce and signaling a need for broader economic support.

          <p>A 79-year-old Los Angeles car wash owner, Rafie Ollah Shouhed, is suing federal immigration officials for $50 million, alleging he was body slammed, dogpiled, and denied medical attention for 12 hours during a September immigration raid. Shouhed claims masked agents used excessive force when he inquired about the operation and attempted to vouch for employees' legal status, resulting in broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury. The Department of Homeland Security, however, stated Shouhed impeded the operation and was arrested for assaulting a federal officer. This lawsuit adds to widespread controversy over ICE raids in Los Angeles, which have prompted mass protests and other legal challenges against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal are warning subscribers of an impending carriage dispute that could lead to a blackout of NBCUniversal programming, including popular shows like "Sunday Night Football" and "The Voice," by month's end. NBCUniversal accuses YouTube TV of demanding preferential treatment and unfair rates, aiming for an advantage over competitors. Conversely, YouTube TV argues that NBCUniversal is asking for more than what it charges consumers for the same content on its Peacock streaming service. With YouTube TV having around 10 million subscribers, this dispute highlights the streaming platform's growing influence and the evolving, often contentious, dynamics of content distribution in the digital age. YouTube TV has offered subscribers a $10 credit if the blackout occurs.</p>

Yang, who helped draft multiple previous plans, specifically advocated for increasing the share of household disposable income in national income and boosting consumer spending's share of total demand.

          <p>Cities worldwide, including New York, Washington D.C., and London, are experiencing a "Ratmageddon" with significant increases in rat populations, posing health and environmental challenges. Pest control companies report a remarkable surge in call-outs, with millions of infestations reported in the UK alone. Researchers link this global rise to factors like warmer winters, which allow rats to breed more prolifically, and expanding urban development that reduces their natural habitats while creating more places to live. Overflowing bins and abundant fast food waste further contribute to the problem. Experts emphasize that cutting off rats' food sources and improving urban sanitation are crucial for effective control, rather than relying solely on poisons, which rats are increasingly resistant to.</p>

Opponents fear these closures, part of a shift towards larger offices or remote working, will decimate local community engagement and compromise the charity's ability to answer its critical helpline calls. Volunteers express significant opposition, citing a perceived lack of consultation and concerns that remote working lacks the necessary peer support for difficult, often life-threatening calls. Critics argue the proposed changes are unsustainable and could severely harm the organization's life-saving work, with some branches even calling for the chairman's removal amidst widespread "despair and disillusionment" among the volunteer base.</p>
