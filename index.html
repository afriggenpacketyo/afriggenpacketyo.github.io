          <p>European stock markets opened lower as investors monitor new US trade tariffs and a looming political deadlock in Washington. The Trump administration announced plans for a 10% tariff on timber and a 25% duty on furniture, citing economic and national security threats. Additionally, the possibility of a U.S. federal government shutdown is causing global market uncertainty, with concerns that it could impact America's credit rating. This financial anxiety is compounded by existing worries about a slowing labor market and elevated stock valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump is engaging in a cycle of political retribution, using the Justice Department to target figures who previously investigated him, such as former FBI Director James Comey. The author suggests this mirrors what Trump perceives was done to him through various investigations by prosecutors like Alvin Bragg and Fani Willis. The piece contends that by openly ordering investigations into his political enemies, Trump is weaponizing the justice system in an unprecedented manner. This creates a dangerous precedent where each new administration may seek to prosecute the previous one.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taliban government has enacted a complete shutdown of telecommunications services across Afghanistan, leading to what internet watchdogs describe as a "total internet blackout." The move, which follows weeks of severed fibre-optic connections, has disrupted international news agencies, mobile internet, and satellite TV. While the Taliban have not provided an official reason, the shutdown is believed to be part of broader "morality measures" to filter content. The blackout is expected to severely impact daily life, including banking, e-commerce, and access to education for many Afghans.</p>

          <p>A Dutch-flagged cargo vessel, the Minervagracht, was struck by a missile and set ablaze in the Gulf of Aden, injuring two crew members and forcing the abandonment of the ship. The attack is suspected to have been carried out by Yemen-based Houthi rebels, who have previously targeted shipping in the region in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians. This incident occurs as diplomatic efforts continue regarding a Gaza peace plan proposed by the U.S. The ongoing maritime attacks by the Houthis highlight the broader regional instability connected to the conflict in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern Ireland's communities minister, Gordon Lyons, has stated that a severe shortage of social housing is fueling racial tensions in the region. He explained that long-standing residents waiting years for homes are growing concerned as asylum seekers are housed in their communities, often in deprived areas where accommodation is cheaper. While condemning the racism, Lyons acknowledged the underlying pressure on resources. Community leaders echo these concerns, emphasizing that the core issue is the lack of available housing for everyone, which creates a competitive and tense environment.</p>

          <p>A building at the Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school in Indonesia's East Java province has collapsed, resulting in at least one death and trapping dozens of students.

Rescue operations are underway, with officials providing oxygen and water to those still stuck under the debris. While over 100 people have been rescued, reports indicate that between 38 and 65 individuals, mostly children, remain missing as of Tuesday morning.</p>

It details the region's history from the 1947 UN Partition Plan through Israel's occupation since the 1967 Six-Day War. The piece highlights the significant challenge posed by the expansion of Israeli settlements, which are considered illegal under international law and now house up to 800,000 settlers. It also explains the division of the territory into Areas A, B, and C under the Oslo Accords, which restricts Palestinian governance and movement.</p>

          <p>The UK's Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, is set to announce plans for a new NHS Online hospital service, slated to launch in England by 2027. The digital service will feature its own dedicated doctors and nurses to conduct assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments virtually via the NHS app. The goal is to reduce waiting times and deliver up to 8.5 million appointments in its first three years, focusing on specialties like ophthalmology and gynaecology where inpatient treatment isn't always necessary. Critics raise concerns about implementation, staffing, and potential "digital exclusion" for patients without internet access.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have recommended a prison sentence of at least 11 years for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who was convicted on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that despite his acquittal on more serious charges, his "decades of unchecked violence" and abusive behavior warrant a significant sentence. They specifically cited the physical abuse of his former partner, Cassie Ventura, as evidence of his unrepentant nature. Combs' defense team has characterized the recommendation as "draconian," arguing for a sentence closer to time served.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Trump administration is urging Taiwan to shift semiconductor production so that half of America's chips are made domestically. This "50-50" plan aims to reduce U.S. reliance on Taiwan, which currently produces over 90% of the world's most advanced chips. Lutnick argued against the "Silicon Shield" theory, suggesting that a more balanced production would better ensure Taiwan's security by making the U.S. a more invested partner. The goal is to reach 40% domestic production by the end of the current presidential term, requiring over $500 billion in local investment. (not investment advice)</p>

In its statement, the RBA acknowledged that inflation might be more persistent than previously expected, although it has cut rates by 75 basis points earlier this year. Despite the pause, some analysts believe the central bank has effectively controlled inflation and may be positioned for a rate cut later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are shifting their strategy to combat a slump in sales by emulating discount models like those of Aldi and Lidl. Amid economic uncertainty, these chains are reducing clutter in their large hypermarkets and focusing on developing their own private-label brands. These store brands offer quality comparable to name brands but at lower prices by cutting out intermediaries and reducing marketing costs. The move is a direct response to a change in consumer behavior, as shoppers become more rational and seek better value for their money.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center is warning that Hurricane Humberto, currently a major Category 3 storm, will likely generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast this week. The storm rapidly intensified over the weekend and is forecast to pass west of Bermuda, where tropical storm conditions are possible. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., its powerful swells will impact coastal areas for several days. Humberto is one of two storm systems in the Atlantic, with the other being Tropical Storm Imelda.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane but is projected to move away from the southeastern United States. The storm is currently moving north in the Atlantic and is expected to turn toward the northeast, approaching Bermuda by mid-week, where a hurricane watch is in effect. While direct impact on the U.S. mainland is not anticipated, swells generated by Imelda, along with Hurricane Humberto, are affecting the Bahamas and will spread to the U.S. East Coast. These conditions are likely to cause dangerous surf and rip currents along the coastline.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British military veterans have initiated legal action against the industrial company 3M, alleging that faulty combat earplugs supplied to the Ministry of Defence caused permanent hearing damage, including tinnitus and deafness.

This lawsuit follows a $6 billion settlement 3M reached in 2023 to resolve similar claims from over 240,000 U.S. service members. 3M maintains that the product is effective when used correctly and has stated it is prepared to defend itself in the UK courts.</p>

          <p>The Miami Dolphins defeated the New York Jets 27-21 to claim their first victory of the season, but the win was overshadowed by a severe injury to star wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Hill suffered a dislocated left knee in the third quarter after making a catch and is likely to miss the remainder of the season. The game also marked a successful return for tight end Darren Waller, who scored two touchdowns after coming out of retirement. Despite the win, the loss of Hill, one of the league's most productive receivers, is a major blow to the Dolphins' season outlook.</p>

According to the court filing, the settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by the Google-owned company. A significant portion of the funds, $22 million, will be directed to a nonprofit for a construction project at the White House. This follows similar settlements Trump reached with Meta and X (formerly Twitter) over his suspension from their platforms for concerns about inciting further violence.</p>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs that were found alone and malnourished earlier this year have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the San Diego County wilderness. The cubs were cared for at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to ensure they retained their wild instincts. This approach is crucial for their survival, as they learn natural hunting behaviors without becoming habituated to humans. The release is a positive development for California's "near-threatened" mountain lion population, which faces ongoing risks from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.</p>

While the burden of their past title drought is gone, the team faces high expectations to become the first MLB team to win back-to-back championships in 25 years. Following an underwhelming regular season by their standards, the Dodgers aim to build on a strong finish and find a new postseason identity. Their success in the wild-card round will rely heavily on their star-studded starting pitching to compensate for an uncertain bullpen.</p>

          <p>This analysis describes President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan as a significant diplomatic step, but one that faces fundamental obstacles to becoming a reality. The article notes that while the proposal shifts the U.S. position and pressures Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, its success depends on whether both Israel and Hamas see more to gain from peace than from continued conflict. The plan contains ambiguities that either side could use to sabotage negotiations while blaming the other. Ultimately, the framework borrows from previous proposals and requires extensive work to detail specifics on withdrawals, prisoner exchanges, and post-war governance.</p>
