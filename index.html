        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir resulted in civilian casualties, India launched strikes against Pakistan, escalating tensions between the two nuclear powers. India claimed to have targeted terrorist infrastructure, while Pakistan decried the strikes as an unprovoked act of war and promised retaliation. Reports indicated that aircraft were downed on both sides, though details remained unconfirmed, leading to airport closures and heightened security measures. The international community, including President Trump and the U.N., called for restraint amid fears of a broader military confrontation. The history of conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir is long and complex, with Kashmiris rarely having a say in their own fate. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk reported a rise in first-quarter net profit, but the company has lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to weaker demand for its Wegovy weight loss drug. Sales of Wegovy rose 83% annually, but fell slightly short of analysts' expectations, while sales of Ozempic beat forecasts. The company now anticipates sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, a decrease from the previously predicted 16% to 24%. This adjustment reflects the impact of increased competition from copycat compounders in the weight loss drug market. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the U.S. administration expresses skepticism towards trade deals, other countries are actively pursuing bilateral agreements to strengthen economic ties. The U.K. and India have agreed on a trade agreement to eliminate tariffs, while ASEAN and China are negotiating improvements to their free-trade agreement. This comes as the U.S. Treasury Secretary claims to be close to some deals and the newly elected Canadian Prime Minister met with the U.S. President, but the growing protectionism of the U.S. may ironically help other countries forge closer economic ties with each other, potentially bypassing the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new bill is being introduced to Parliament that would allow judges to add up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The move is intended to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and to provide a moment of recognition and reparation for victims' families. While some argue that the additional jail time may not be a significant deterrent for those facing lengthy sentences, others suggest restricting family visits and parole eligibility as alternative options.</p>

          <p>China's top securities regulator, Wu Qing, has pledged to further open up the nation’s financial markets and boost foreign institutional access, with a focus on promoting Hong Kong as a global finance hub. This comes amid intensifying trade tensions and decoupling risks with the U.S., where Republican lawmakers are urging the SEC to expel Chinese firms from American exchanges. The CSRC plans to streamline processes for Chinese firms to list abroad, add yuan-denominated stock counters to the southbound Stock Connect mechanism, and support the launch of cross-border investment and risk-management products in Hong Kong.</p>

Pakistan, with declining relevance to the U.S., increasingly relies on China for military equipment. These changing patterns inject superpower politics into the long-standing conflict between India and Pakistan, with the United States cultivating India as a partner against China, and Beijing deepening its support for Pakistan.</p>

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Joe Biden accused President Trump of "modern-day appeasement" towards Russia, particularly regarding Ukraine. Biden expressed concerns that Trump's approach would undermine the Atlantic Alliance and encourage other European countries to make accommodations with Putin. He criticized Trump's calls for the U.S. to take back the Panama Canal and seize Greenland, questioning his behavior as unpresidential and stating, "That's not who we are."</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis. While the dollar's reserve-currency status plays a role in trade deficits, it is just one of many factors. The analysis argues that the current account deficit is influenced by the balance between national saving and investment, with the fiscal deficit and strength of the American economy also being key factors. The article suggests that closing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal, which creates a joint investment fund to access Ukraine’s mineral wealth, has been widely seen as a victory for Ukraine, owing to how earlier iterations contained far more onerous terms, but the final agreement still bears the marks of the raw colonialism of the original vision.</p>
