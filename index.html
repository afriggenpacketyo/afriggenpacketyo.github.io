          <p>An internal review reveals FEMA is not fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, despite the acting administrator's assurances of being 80-85% ready and aiming for 97-98% soon. The report cites staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and coordination gaps with states as key issues. Acting Administrator Richardson emphasized the need to safeguard Americans, return primacy to states, and coordinate federal assistance while transforming FEMA, indicating a shift towards a smaller footprint and more state-level resources. Morale is reportedly low within FEMA due to proposed agency eliminations and internal conflicts regarding the President's objectives. </p>

A contingency plan, accommodating only 20% of daily riders, will include cross-honoring rail tickets on buses, light rail lines, and the MTA.

          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 600 employees, primarily journalists, at Voice of America, a federally funded news network providing independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. These layoffs represent over a third of the network's staff and signal a continued effort to dismantle the broadcaster, despite previous court rulings. The administration also put the building housing Voice of America up for sale, and plans to incorporate content from One America News Network.

          <p>The Trump administration's deals to sell advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have ignited internal debate about potentially outsourcing the AI industry. The deals, negotiated by administration officials with ties to Silicon Valley, aim to boost American AI companies and expand their reach. However, critics fear inadequate protections could allow the technology to benefit China, and that these deals might lead to the world's largest data centers being located in the Middle East instead of the United States. The administration defends the agreements as necessary to win the AI race and ensure American technology remains at the forefront. </p>

          <p>Republicans are advancing a megabill aimed at enacting President Trump's agenda, proposing significant tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy, increased military spending, and stricter immigration enforcement. To offset these costs, the bill proposes slashing funding for health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Key components include extending many of the 2017 tax cuts, implementing work requirements for Medicaid, and curtailing clean energy tax credits.

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 years ago. These migrations were facilitated by the Bering land bridge, which connected the two continents when sea levels were lower. The study, published in the journal Science, analyzed fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. This suggests that genetic exchanges occurred in both directions across the land bridge. </p>

Comey removed the post, claiming ignorance of the potential meaning and denouncing violence, while allies of Trump have condemned Comey's actions and called for his arrest. This incident highlights the deeply antagonistic relationship between Comey and Trump, dating back to Comey's firing during the Russia investigation. </p>

The move has support from Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but raises questions about the future of measures imposed on the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for terrorism.

          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts Amid Export Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 21:19:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This contraction, exceeding economists' expectations, is attributed to uncertainties stemming from President Trump's trade policies. The Bank of Japan has warned of potential economic moderation due to global trade policies, and the country is currently engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. Despite these concerns, the central bank is likely to continue raising its policy rate, driven by inflation surpassing the 2% target for three consecutive years. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top US diplomat Marco Rubio believes that a breakthrough in Ukraine-Russia peace talks is unlikely without direct interaction between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He expressed skepticism about the upcoming talks in Turkey, citing the 'low-level' delegation sent by Moscow. Similarly, Trump suggested that significant progress requires a personal meeting between him and Putin, emphasizing the need to resolve the conflict to stop the loss of life. Despite Ukraine sending a delegation, the lack of high-level representation from Russia raises doubts about the seriousness of the negotiations. </p>

          <p>The number of disabled people facing homelessness in England has increased by nearly 75% since 2019, with over 60,000 disabled households affected last year. Simultaneously, the amount of social housing allocated to disabled individuals has decreased. This rise in homelessness among disabled people has sparked concerns within the Labour Party regarding planned cuts to disability benefits. The government states it is providing ¬£1bn to councils to support families and prevent homelessness, while a senior Treasury source highlights increased investment in public services and infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Small businesses are experiencing financial whiplash due to President Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Chinese imports, creating uncertainty and challenges for business owners like Bobby Djavaheri. Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, faced a 145% tariff hike, then a reduction to 30% following a truce between the U.S. and China. These changes have forced him to increase prices and rush orders for the holiday season, while logistics companies see increased demand for facilities that allow companies to defer tariff payments. The situation leaves many businesses struggling to stay afloat amid the ongoing trade war. </p>
