          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to DNA test all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative aims to revolutionize prevention and provide faster diagnoses by using genomics and AI. The scheme, part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using blood samples from their umbilical cord. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes this technology will enable personalized healthcare and reduce pressure on NHS services, ultimately helping people live longer, healthier lives.</p>

Xiaomi, for example, is planning a comeback with 500 new retail stores outside China this year, particularly in developed markets, with a long-term goal of 10,000 stores overseas in the next five years. This expansion follows an adjustment in Xiaomiâ€™s retail strategy, aimed at responding to the purchasing behavior of European consumers.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported a significant increase in assaults against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during enforcement operations. Agents have experienced a 500% increase in assaults, with incidents including an ICE officer being dragged by a car while arresting an illegal alien sex offender. The DHS blames Democrat politicians for allegedly contributing to the surge in assaults through their vilification and demonization of ICE. The department said it will not be deterred and will continue to enforce the law, prosecuting those who assault law enforcement officers to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has approved a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social change. The bill will now proceed to the House of Lords, where it is expected to face further scrutiny and debate. The government anticipates a longer "commencement period" to ensure necessary preparations are made, potentially delaying the implementation of the law. Opinion polls indicate substantial public support for the change, and this bill is compared by many to the Abortion Act of 1967, the abolition of capital punishment, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the introduction of gay marriage.</p>

          <p>Water levels at Iraq's Dukan Dam reservoir have significantly decreased due to dwindling rains and upstream damming, leading to stricter water rationing for millions of inhabitants. The lake is now three-quarters empty, with reserves at approximately 24% of its capacity, marking the lowest level in about 20 years. The decline is attributed to climate change, irregular rainfall, and upstream damming of the Little Zab River in Iran. This shortage has affected around four million people downstream, impacting their access to drinking water and requiring stricter rationing measures.</p>

Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, Beijing's pronatalist policies are expected to have limited effect, failing to address deep-rooted issues such as high economic costs and changing social preferences.

          <p>King Charles has recorded a personal message to researchers in Antarctica celebrating Midwinter's Day, marking the first time a monarch has given the annual broadcast. He praised the scientists' work in tracking climate change and their resilience in a challenging environment. The broadcast, a tradition for scientists at isolated bases, included contributions from figures like Sir David Attenborough and Bill Bailey. The King's message highlighted the importance of the British Antarctic Survey's research in understanding environmental changes.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's long-standing rhetoric about the Iranian threat has culminated in Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, a move that has broad support within Israel. While the attack has provided Netanyahu with a moment of political relief and an opportunity to rewrite his legacy, it carries significant risks, including the potential for a devastating "war of cities." The attack on Iran is seen by some as a politically motivated decision aimed at distracting from his domestic troubles and bolstering his image, but its long-term consequences remain uncertain.</p>

The proposal now heads to the desk of Governor Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans. The bill only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons and not possession, making it the weakest assault weapons ban in the country according to some gun control advocates. Critics argue that the ban does little to curb mass shootings and punishes law-abiding citizens.</p>

          <p>A Meiji Yasuda Research Institute study found that Japan incurred a record 6.8 trillion yen digital trade deficit in 2024 due to domestic firms' heavy reliance on technologies provided by U.S. IT giants.
