          <p>A Berlin court has ruled it unlawful to turn away asylum seekers at Germany's borders without adhering to the EU's Dublin procedure, a decision that challenges the new federal migration policy. The court's emergency ruling came in response to the case of three Somali nationals who were turned back to Poland from Frankfurt an der Oder on May 9, under a new German regulation. The court stated that such rejections circumvent necessary legal procedures and violate asylum rights, emphasizing the importance of following due process in handling asylum claims. The decision highlights the tension between national migration policies and international legal obligations.</p>

          <p>A new international study has found that colon cancer patients who participated in a three-year exercise program experienced improved survival rates. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, showed that the exercise program kept the disease at bay, rivaling the benefits of some drugs. Patients in the exercise group met regularly with a coach and showed a 28% reduction in cancer recurrences and a 37% decrease in deaths from any cause after eight years. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a standard part of care for colon cancer survivors.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a major redesign of the country's flight paths to potentially reduce journey times, decrease delays, and increase the number of flights. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will lead the remodelling, focusing initially on the complex airspace around London, with changes expected in the 2030s. The government hopes the modernized airspace will allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate impact and paving the way for new technologies like flying taxis. However, environmental groups like Friends of the Earth have expressed concerns that the redesign could expose more communities to noise and air pollution.</p>

          <p>A parliamentary inquiry in France is investigating the influence of French billionaires in promoting far-right agendas, with a focus on Pierre-Edouard Sterin's Pericles project, which has invested millions in conservative initiatives. The inquiry aims to determine if Pericles adheres to French campaign rules, particularly regarding its support for far-right media outlets and organizations. The article highlights concerns about the concentration of media ownership in France, with a significant portion of news outlets controlled by a small number of wealthy individuals. Critics argue that this concentration allows for the spread of far-right narratives and undermines democratic processes.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge to Maryland's ban on assault weapons, which was enacted after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The justices' decision leaves the state's ban in place, along with similar measures in other states and the District of Columbia. While the court rejected the case, three conservative justices publicly noted their interest in hearing it, and a fourth expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of such bans. This suggests the court may revisit the issue in the future, particularly given the ongoing debate over Second Amendment rights and gun control measures.</p>

HELOCs can provide flexibility, but it's important to understand the terms and potential risks. By carefully weighing the advantages and drawbacks of different home equity options, homeowners can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway have surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a downward trend in other European markets. The increase is primarily attributed to strong sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV.

Despite the sales increase, a survey indicates that a significant percentage of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla due to political reasons.</p>

          <p>Stephen Curry, a four-time NBA champion and two-time MVP, admits to experiencing impostor syndrome despite his numerous accomplishments. Curry, who grew up in the shadow of his NBA star father, Dell Curry, says he didn't initially expect to play in the league due to his stature and underdog mentality. He has embraced his underdog status and used it as motivation throughout his career. Curry also juggles various off-court ventures, including his media company, bourbon brand, and philanthropic foundation, leading him to question whether he is fulfilling his full potential in all areas of his life.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court decision in *Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County* limits the scope of environmental litigation, particularly under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Court's conservative majority emphasized deference to government decisions regarding environmental reviews, potentially reducing the ability of environmental groups to block projects. While this may streamline infrastructure development, it raises concerns about the Court's skepticism towards environmental regulation and its uneven application of deference. The decision may lead to less intrusive judicial review of agency actions, but could also result in agencies being less accountable for environmental impacts.</p>
