          <p>President Trump has publicly confirmed he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. This high-stakes summit coincides with a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe new economic sanctions, including secondary tariffs on its trade partners. While Trump has expressed optimism about brokering peace, which he suggested might involve territorial swaps, the actual terms of any deal remain highly uncertain. The meeting marks the first direct talks between Putin and a U.S. president since 2021.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that forward Alexander Isak is currently not being involved with the first team, following the club's rejection of a £110 million bid from Liverpool. Although Isak is not injured or officially disciplined, he is training separately from the squad after expressing a desire to explore other options. Howe indicated that the situation is unlikely to change before the season opener, highlighting a frustrating transfer window for the club. This development adds to Newcastle's challenges as they prepare for their upcoming season and Champions League campaign.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit alternative investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies, within 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to "democratize" retirement savings by providing access to asset classes that proponents claim can deliver excellent long-term returns. However, financial experts caution that these investments carry significantly higher risks, greater complexity, and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. The implementation of any changes is expected to be a slow process, with uncertainty remaining about whether employers will adopt these more volatile options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new documentary, “It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley,” provides a loving and honest portrait of the late musician, focusing on his complex life rather than a narrative of inescapable fate. The film uses archival material and interviews with close friends and family to explore his turbulent upbringing, his creative development in New York, and his conflicted feelings about fame. This article's review praises the film for dimensionalizing Buckley beyond his one-album legacy and for thoughtfully handling his tragic 1997 death as an accident. It presents a sensitive and intimate look at the artist's life and struggles.</p>

          <p>Instagram has introduced a new "Map" feature that allows users to share their real-time location, sparking concerns among privacy experts about potential safety risks, especially for younger users.

          <p>President Trump has removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service just two months after he was sworn into the role, marking an unusually short tenure. Long, a former congressman from Missouri, is expected to be nominated as the ambassador to Iceland, a move he confirmed on social media. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting IRS commissioner in the interim. The abrupt departure comes after the implementation of new tariffs and tax code changes under the Trump administration, as well as significant job cuts at the agency.</p>

This decision signals a major escalation of the conflict and comes as Netanyahu faces immense pressure from his political allies for his own political survival.

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, overturning a lower court's criminal contempt finding against officials involved in the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case stems from the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, which a district judge had ordered to halt. Despite the order, planes carrying the migrants landed in El Salvador. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court is a significant victory for the administration, which had argued the district judge overstepped his authority in the contentious immigration case.</p>

          <p>A former Los Angeles Police Department officer, Eric Halem, has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in a series of home burglaries in the San Fernando Valley. The alleged crimes took place in the same West Valley Division where Halem previously worked as an officer. Halem, who resigned in 2022 to become a reserve officer, was already facing separate insurance fraud charges related to a luxury car rental business he operated. He is now being held without bail in connection with the burglaries, details of which have not been fully released by the LAPD.</p>

          <p>USC cornerback Prophet Brown, who had been a standout performer in preseason camp, will miss the beginning of the football season after suffering a noncontact injury in practice. Coach Lincoln Riley confirmed that Brown would be out for at least the first few games, a significant blow to the team's defense. Brown was considered a leading candidate for the starting slot corner position, and his absence will put more pressure on younger defensive backs to step up. The injury is a setback for a player who was praised by the defensive coordinator as one of the most trusted on the defense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to resolve a civil rights investigation and restore suspended federal funding. The Department of Justice concluded that UCLA was "deliberately indifferent" to a hostile environment for Jewish students during pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. In response, the administration has frozen $584 million in federal research grants to the university. University of California's president stated that a payment of this magnitude would be devastating to the public university system and the vital research it conducts.</p>

In the chase, opener Tom Banton's 43 runs anchored the innings, and the Rockets reached their target comfortably with 22 balls remaining.

This progress follows a major investment from the U.S. Department of Defense, which purchased $400 million in preferred stock, making the government its largest shareholder.

In response, authorities are deploying soldiers to spray insecticide and forcing some infected individuals into isolation, reminiscent of COVID-19 tactics. While the virus is rarely fatal, the population's lack of immunity has prompted an aggressive response to contain its spread. The CDC has issued a travel notice for the region.</p>

          <p>Attorneys and prosecutors across the U.S. are expressing growing concern that arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at criminal courthouses are creating a chilling effect that harms the justice system. The practice, which has increased under the Trump administration, is reportedly deterring undocumented immigrants—including defendants, witnesses, and victims of crime—from appearing in court. Legal experts argue this fear prevents cases from being properly litigated, pressures defendants into plea deals, and allows perpetrators to evade justice. The tactic is seen by some as a threat to the fundamental ability of courts to function effectively.</p>
