        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts express concern over a potential new nuclear arms race as trilateral talks between the United States, Russia, and China remain at an impasse. A previous push by the Trump administration for negotiations was firmly rejected by Beijing, which complicates efforts to extend critical agreements like the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). China has consistently maintained its long-standing policy of "no first use" and states its nuclear arsenal is kept at the minimum level required for self-defense, viewing the proposal to join talks as unrealistic. This diplomatic stalemate leaves the future of global arms control uncertain.</p>

          <p>WNBA star Caitlin Clark revealed on social media that she was fined $200 by the league for a comment she made on Instagram celebrating the Indiana Fever's playoff victory. The comment, which stated "refs couldn't stop us," was posted on a fan account's screenshot and quickly drew the league's attention. This incident adds to the ongoing contentious relationship between Clark and WNBA officials, a recurring theme where Clark, her teammates, and coach have previously voiced frustrations over what they perceive as unfair or inadequate officiating. Her teammate Sophie Cunningham even jokingly suggested starting a fundraiser to pay the fine.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's sudden imposition of a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications has triggered a frantic response from major technology companies and international governments. Tech giants like Amazon and JPMorgan Chase advised employees on these visas to remain in or immediately return to the U.S., fearing that international travel could jeopardize their immigration status. The move, which affects the highly skilled foreign workers who are crucial to the U.S. tech and finance sectors, has been criticized by India's Ministry of External Affairs for its potential "humanitarian consequences" and disruption to families, highlighting the global shockwaves of the new policy.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to formally announce the United Kingdom's recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. This decision follows a deadline the government had set for Israel to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza and commit to a sustainable two-state solution. The move is intended to keep the hope of a long-term peace deal alive amid worsening conditions, including settlement expansion. However, it has drawn sharp criticism from the Israeli government, some Conservative politicians, and families of hostages held by Hamas, who argue it rewards terrorism.</p>

          <p>In a direct challenge to the Trump administration's immigration policies, California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at protecting immigrant communities. One of the most significant laws bans federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty, a response to recent raids by masked ICE agents. Other measures restrict immigration enforcement access to nonpublic areas of schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant. Newsom characterized the legislation as a stand against authoritarian "secret police" tactics, while federal officials have condemned the move, arguing it endangers their officers.</p>

          <p>Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a critical access hospital in a remote part of California's eastern Sierra, is facing imminent financial collapse with only a few days of cash on hand. Local and state officials have sent an urgent request to Governor Gavin Newsom for a $3 million emergency bailout to prevent the facility from closing or severely cutting services. The hospital is the only one within a nearly 60-mile radius, serving a small local population as well as over a million annual tourists visiting nearby Death Valley and Mt. Whitney. Its potential closure would create a vast "medical desert" in the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Southwest faces a renewed threat of flash flooding as another surge of monsoonal moisture moves into the region, particularly affecting parts of Southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico. This comes after recent deadly floods in the area, with burn scars from previous wildfires being especially vulnerable to debris flows. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is churning and expected to strengthen into the second hurricane of the season. Forecasters predict Gabrielle will remain at sea and pose no direct threat to land as it moves northeastward, away from Bermuda.</p>

          <p>Sonny Curtis, a pioneering rock and roll musician and prolific songwriter, has passed away at the age of 88. A childhood friend of Buddy Holly and an early member of The Crickets, Curtis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. He penned the iconic rock anthem "I Fought the Law," famously covered by The Clash, and the Everly Brothers' hit "Walk Right Back." However, he is perhaps most widely known for writing and performing "Love Is All Around," the beloved theme song for the classic 1970s sitcom "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."</p>

          <p>A chaotic qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was marred by a record six red flags after more than a quarter of the Formula 1 drivers crashed on the challenging Baku street circuit. Difficult conditions, including strong winds and light rain, contributed to the incidents, which affected title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who will start seventh and ninth, respectively. Drivers described the conditions as incredibly difficult, with unpredictable wind gusts making corners treacherous. Max Verstappen ultimately secured pole position amidst the turmoil, setting the stage for an unpredictable race with a mixed-up grid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a critical red flag in a romantic relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, like one partner consistently walking ahead of the other, or in more significant actions, such as devaluing a partner's priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that respect is a fundamental ingredient for a thriving relationship, as people enter partnerships to be seen and valued. She advises addressing these behaviors through direct conversation to determine if change is possible.</p>

In a letter, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks to keep the government open. The request comes after the House passed a short-term spending bill that failed in the Senate, with both parties blaming each other for the impending shutdown and the potential consequences for federal services and employees.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois that their refusal to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could lead to lawsuits and cuts in federal funding. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states comply with immigration detainers, which are requests to hold individuals for federal custody. The states have largely refused, citing state laws and constitutional concerns. The Trump administration argues these policies release dangerous criminals into communities, while the states maintain they are protecting residents' rights and fostering community trust.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new executive powers to prevent U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, a move that would have impacted nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights obtained by the government as part of the national-security agreement for the company's $14.1 billion acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. The agreement gives the White House veto power over major strategic decisions, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly informed U.S. Steel's CEO that the administration would not permit the closure, forcing the company to reverse its decision.

Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the artist, his band, and the public, the concerts at Boston's MGM Music Hall and Connecticut's Foxwoods Resort Casino were called off.

The system reportedly integrates data from various sources like sonar buoys and water temperature to create a real-time underwater map, potentially neutralizing traditional submarine camouflage and defense tactics. While some view this as psychological warfare intended to project technological superiority, the development raises serious questions for Western military strategy. If effective, it could undermine the submarine-based leg of the nuclear triad, a cornerstone of deterrence for powers like the United States.</p>
