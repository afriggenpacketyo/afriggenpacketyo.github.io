          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian students for deportation. In a detailed 161-page decision, U.S. District Judge William Young stated that senior officials acted to suppress constitutionally protected speech and instill fear among international students. The judge's searing rebuke characterized the administration's actions as a misuse of power intended to chill political dissent on college campuses, calling it a significant threat to free speech in America.</p>

          <p>A federal government shutdown would likely lead to the closure of Washington, D.C.'s most popular cultural institutions, including the 21 Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo. While the Smithsonian might use reserve funds to remain open for a short period, a prolonged shutdown would shutter its doors and turn off the zoo's popular animal webcams. In contrast, outdoor monuments and memorials are expected to remain physically accessible, though federally-run tours and visitor centers would be suspended, impacting tourists and local activities.</p>

          <p>India defeated Sri Lanka by 59 runs in their opening match of the Women's Cricket World Cup, overcoming a significant mid-innings collapse. After slipping to 124-6, a crucial 103-run partnership between Amanjot Kaur and Deepti Sharma revived the Indian side, helping them post a competitive total of 269-8. Sharma also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets to help bowl Sri Lanka out for 211 in front of a record-breaking crowd. The victory provides India with a strong start as they seek their first World Cup title.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown would have far-reaching consequences, forcing millions of federal employees and military service members to work without pay or be furloughed. Essential services like air traffic control and airport security would continue, but workers would not be paid, potentially leading to staffing shortages as seen in past shutdowns. The disruption would also affect national parks, food safety inspections, and the distribution of some federal aid, while Social Security and Medicare payments would continue uninterrupted, though related services may slow.</p>

          <p>For consumers overwhelmed by debt, finding a trustworthy debt settlement program is crucial but can be challenging due to predatory companies. Reputable programs are typically accredited by professional organizations like the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators and maintain a high rating with the Better Business Bureau. They are transparent about their fee structure, never charge upfront costs before services are rendered, and provide honest communication about the risks, including potential damage to credit scores and a realistic timeline for completion.

          <p>Warren Buffett has long advocated for everyday investors to use low-cost S&P 500 index funds, arguing it's the most effective way to achieve long-term market returns. However, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests a hybrid approach, recommending that investors place about half their portfolio in index funds and the other half in a handful of well-researched individual stocks. Cramer argues that while index funds provide a solid, average return, diligent investors can outperform the market by picking winning companies, a strategy he details in his new book.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travelers can often find cheaper fares by booking separate flights and creating a 'self-transfer' itinerary, but this strategy comes with significant risks. Unlike traditional connections booked through a single airline, self-connecting passengers are not guaranteed rebooking or accommodation if their first flight is delayed and they miss the second. This approach requires passengers to potentially go through security and passport control again, and they must have the proper documentation for the connecting country. While it can save money, a missed connection can lead to extremely expensive last-minute ticket purchases.</p>

          <p>The widely misunderstood "7-year rule" primarily pertains to how long negative information, such as unpaid credit card debt, can remain on a consumer's credit report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most delinquent accounts, charge-offs, and collections must be removed after seven years from the date of the first missed payment. However, this does not erase the debt itself, and collectors may still attempt to collect. Additionally, each state has its own statute of limitations, which dictates the time frame in which a creditor can legally sue a borrower for the debt.</p>

          <p>Seventy years ago, actor James Dean was killed in a car crash at the age of 24, cementing his status as a cultural icon. Despite having made only three films, including "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Giant," his brooding performances captured a sense of youthful rebellion that resonated deeply in the 1950s. His sudden death catapulted him to a legendary level of fame, leading to two posthumous Oscar nominations. Dean's timeless look, acting talent, and the tragic nature of his passing have ensured his legacy endures decades later.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have recommended that Sean “Diddy” Combs be sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that a substantial prison term is necessary due to the seriousness of his crimes and his lack of remorse. Combs was convicted in July but acquitted of more severe sex trafficking and racketeering charges. His defense team has requested a sentence of no more than 14 months, citing his rehabilitation while incarcerated.</p>

This marks a significant shift from the previous Labour government's goal of 50% university attendance, placing a greater emphasis on technical qualifications and skills training. The new ambition aims to see at least 10% of young people in higher technical courses or apprenticeships by 2040. The policy change has been welcomed by colleges and manufacturers as a step toward valuing vocational training equally with academic degrees.</p>

          <p>Greek labor unions have called for a general strike to protest a controversial government bill that could allow for a 13-hour workday. The proposed legislation would permit employees to work for a second employer for up to five additional hours after their primary eight-hour shift. This reform follows a recent law that introduced a mandatory six-day work week in certain sectors. Unions argue that the changes will lead to worker exhaustion and a deterioration of labor rights, while the government contends the measures offer flexibility and adapt legislation to reality.</p>

Drawing from her personal experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, she advocates for a culture that prioritizes well-being, arguing that scientific data proves people are more effective and creative when they are well-rested. Huffington promotes the concept of "micro steps"—small, incremental changes in daily habits—to build a healthier and more sustainable path to achievement, rather than relying on drastic but often-failed resolutions.</p>

          <p>In his "Dear James" advice column, writer James Parker responds to a reader who has lost their creative fire for writing odes about local food and drink. Parker shares his own experience of losing his passion for the form after publishing a book on the topic, a quality he calls "the odeness." He advises the reader that this creative energy can return, suggesting they broaden their range to more abstract subjects like moods or ideas. He concludes that odes do not always need to be rapturous or jolly, but simply need to connect with the unique essence of their subject.</p>
