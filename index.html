          <p>England's cricket team has announced its 16-man squad for the Ashes 2025 series against Australia, with Will Jacks receiving a surprise recall as the back-up spinner. Harry Brook has been elevated to vice-captain, a move that could intensify debate over Ollie Pope's position at number three. The squad includes a strong pace-bowling lineup, despite injury concerns for key players like Mark Wood, who has not played a Test in 15 months. The team aims to maintain loyalty in selection under coach Brendon McCullum, hoping for a successful tour down under.</p>

          <p>Scientists and health experts are strongly refuting recent claims by President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding a link between Tylenol, vaccines, and autism. Trump's White House announcement, which suggested avoiding Tylenol during pregnancy and questioned vaccine safety, alarmed researchers like Ann Bauer, whose work was cited but distorted. Experts from the CDC were not consulted for the announcement, and studies consistently debunk a link between vaccines and autism, emphasizing that fevers, not Tylenol, are more strongly associated with autism.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, deeming their demands for government funding unproductive. With an October 1st deadline approaching, a government shutdown looms as both parties remain at odds over a short-term spending bill. Democrats' proposal includes extended Affordable Care Act tax credits and rolling back some Trump-era policies, which the president criticized as 'radical left' demands. This stalemate highlights deep partisan divisions in Congress.</p>

This initiative signifies a major Wall Street firm's deepening embrace of digital assets, following a shift in the U.S. government's stance on cryptocurrency under President Donald Trump. The bank plans to initially support Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana trading, aiming to integrate traditional and digital assets within a unified wealth management environment. This development is seen as a crucial step towards mainstream crypto adoption.</p>

These terminations, particularly concentrated at the end of a two-year probationary period for many judges, are seen by advocates as contradictory to the administration's stated goal of increasing deportations. Union leaders argue that removing experienced judges exacerbates the already historic backlog of nearly 4 million immigration cases, delaying justice and wasting taxpayer dollars. The firings have fostered a culture of fear within the Executive Office for Immigration Review.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a strong start to the year, single-family home rent growth began to slow in July, increasing only 2.3% year-over-year, below the 3.1% average from a year ago. This weakening, observed across most metro areas and price tiers, suggests landlords may need to adjust to struggling consumers. Monthly rent growth was just 0.2% in July, significantly lower than the historical average. While Chicago leads in rent growth, markets like Miami, which saw soaring growth in 2022, now show no annual increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital, many Palestinians view recent Western recognition of Palestinian statehood as insufficient, emphasizing the need for concrete solutions. While acknowledging the importance of recognition, residents like Diaa believe it will be 'nothing more than ink on paper' without international pressure. Israel, however, has condemned the move as a 'reward for terrorism,' with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterating his opposition to a Palestinian state. The ongoing expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank further complicates the prospects for a viable, contiguous Palestinian state.</p>
