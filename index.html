          <p>Police in Liverpool arrested several individuals at a protest supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, took place outside the Labour party conference, with participants holding signs opposing genocide and supporting the group. Supporters are calling for the government to scrap the ban, which makes membership or support a criminal offense. The protest occurred amidst a separate demonstration by a group opposing digital ID plans, requiring police to keep the two factions apart.</p>

Klobuchar also expressed deep concern over the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, labeling it a "vengeance prosecution" and an example of the Justice Department being weaponized for political purposes.</p>

Authorities reported that the suspected shooter is "down" and there is no longer an active threat to the community. In addition to the shooting, the church building was actively on fire, though emergency crews have since contained the blaze. Governor Gretchen Whitmer and federal officials have expressed their condolences, condemning the violence in a place of worship.</p>

          <p>Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have stated that the debate over extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies should wait until after a government shutdown is averted. They argue that while the ACA needs reform, the immediate priority is to pass a short-term funding bill to keep the government open beyond the Tuesday deadline. This position conflicts with Democrats, who have made the extension of the healthcare tax credits a key condition for their support, setting the stage for a high-stakes negotiation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral TikTok trend encourages people to start their day by jumping 50 times immediately after getting out of bed. Popularized by creator Kathryn Smith, the practice is claimed to quickly increase blood flow and oxygen to the brain, boosting energy and mood. Wellness experts note that the trend's success lies in its accessibility as a simple, low-effort form of morning movement that can release endorphins. While generally considered safe for healthy individuals, experts advise those with existing injuries or medical conditions to consult a healthcare provider before trying the routine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with the top four congressional leaders in a last-ditch effort to prevent a government shutdown, reversing his earlier cancellation of a similar meeting. The primary point of contention is the Democratic demand to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits as part of any funding deal, a condition Republicans want to debate later. Despite the planned meeting, sources indicate the President is not optimistic about reaching an agreement and may welcome a shutdown to assert executive power in cutting what he calls government waste.</p>

          <p>A new poem by Nina C. Peláez titled ‘Syncretism’ has been published, exploring themes of family, faith, and inherited trauma through vivid imagery. The poem centers on the speaker's father, a man who does not believe in God but engages in a ritualistic swimming routine. The narrative delves into the father's buried anger, likening it to a smoldering fire from a childhood incident, and reflects on the speaker's own attempts to learn forgiveness. The poem uses the act of diving into a pool as a metaphor for confronting and disappearing into these complex family dynamics.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly voted in favor of a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system, with 50.4% supporting the measure. This was the second time the issue was put to a vote, with a previous proposal being rejected in 2021 over privacy concerns. The newly approved system addresses these worries by keeping data stored on users' smartphones and placing control in government hands, rather than private companies. The digital ID will be optional, allowing citizens to continue using traditional identity cards.</p>

          <p>A tragic crowd crush at a political rally for actor-turned-politician Vijay in Tamil Nadu, India, has resulted in the deaths of at least 40 people, including nine children. The incident occurred when a crowd, estimated to be more than double the permitted size of 10,000, surged suddenly. Authorities have filed a case against senior members of Vijay's TVK party for negligent conduct, and the state's chief minister has announced compensation for the victims' families. Deadly crushes are a recurring issue at large gatherings in India.</p>

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral." The policy, announced by Nigel Farage, could lead to the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people legally residing in the country. Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer distinguished between removing illegal migrants and targeting legal residents, arguing the latter would "rip this country apart." He also acknowledged that many Reform supporters are not racist but are frustrated with years of Conservative government failures.</p>

Despite early success in the 1960s, the band struggled financially and broke up before their seminal album "Odessey and Oracle" became a belated hit. The album is now considered a classic, and decades after their peak, the surviving members were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.

However, leading indicators from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) show that prices paid by businesses are rising, suggesting future inflationary pressure.

This model contrasts with the traditional "push" system by having final assembly pull components from suppliers only when needed, reducing delays and waste. As global space activity is projected to grow significantly, researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the future space economy. The goal is to produce space systems more quickly, cheaply, and with higher quality.</p>

Phrases such as "It'll just take a second," "No worries if not," and "I'm not an expert, but..." are often used with good intentions but can signal a lack of confidence or urgency. The expert suggests using more direct and specific language instead, such as clearly stating the time needed for a discussion or providing a reason for a request, which can lead to more effective communication and better professional outcomes.</p>

The narrator, a benevolent but unorthodox educator, details his attempts to engage his class, particularly a student named Ornella Zanni who changes her name daily as an act of rebellion. The story culminates in a classroom confrontation where the student labels him a "diseducator," a moment that shatters his carefully constructed persona and forces him to confront the true nature of his influence and his own identity outside the classroom walls.</p>
