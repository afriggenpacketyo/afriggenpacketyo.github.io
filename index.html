          <p>Shane Gorman, whose father perished in the devastating 1988 Piper Alpha oil rig disaster, dedicated his career to offshore safety to understand the event that claimed 167 lives. A new BBC Scotland series delves into the catastrophic gas explosion and subsequent fires, which were intensified by critical communication breakdowns, a lack of management authority to cease pumping, and an overall disregard for safety protocols. The official Cullen report harshly criticized Occidental Petroleum's operations, highlighting systemic failures and a cultural indifference to worker safety. Gorman, now a safety consultant, continues to champion the message that human lives must always take precedence over financial gain, striving to prevent similar future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Three oil paintings, attributed to influential avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich and potentially valued at over £100 million, are currently on display in Bucharest, yet their authenticity is under significant scrutiny. The owner claims they were discovered under his grandmother's bed, inherited from her father who was an Odesa accountant, with the lack of records attributed to Stalin-era repression. However, prominent art scholar Konstantin Akinsha points out that these works were neither documented nor exhibited during Malevich's lifetime, raising serious questions about their provenance. While technical analyses confirm the age of the materials, they do not definitively prove Malevich's authorship, and the involvement of an art historian with a history of authenticating disputed works further fuels the skepticism within the art world.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million Americans in the West, spanning from Arizona to Washington, are under dangerous heat alerts this weekend, with temperatures reaching triple digits and challenging daily records in major cities like Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles. This prolonged and intense heatwave is particularly hazardous due to insufficient overnight cooling, also fueling elevated fire weather concerns across the region. Concurrently, Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the mid-Atlantic, expected to strengthen over open waters. Furthermore, the East Coast continues to experience lingering rough surf and dangerous rip currents from Hurricane Erin, affecting beach safety and plans.</p>

          <p>Parents are advocating for peas and lentils to be added to the UK and EU's list of 14 mandatory food allergens after children experienced severe anaphylactic shock from unexpected pea protein in products like hot cross buns and ice cream. Currently, pea is not required to be listed, making it a hidden danger for those with severe allergies. The article highlights that people with pea allergies often face skepticism, with their condition not being taken as seriously as other common allergies, despite potentially life-threatening reactions. Experts and advocacy groups support expanding the allergen list to include pea, pine nuts, buckwheat, and sheep/goat's milk to enhance consumer safety and confidence.</p>

          <p>A bus carrying the Aliquippa Junior High football team crashed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, leading to the hospitalization of at least 21 students and the bus driver. The incident occurred when the vehicle veered off the road, struck a hillside, and then hit a utility pole, causing it to briefly tip before landing upright. One child remains in critical condition after undergoing surgery, while most others have been discharged.

          <p>A tour bus traveling from Niagara Falls to New York City tragically rolled over on Interstate 90, resulting in the deaths of five individuals, including a 22-year-old Columbia University student from Beijing. The New York State Police have identified the other four adult victims from India and New Jersey. Preliminary reports indicate the 55-year-old driver was distracted and over-corrected, causing the bus to lose control, cross the median, and flip onto the shoulder. While there were no signs of impairment or mechanical failure, the accident led to 21 patients being treated at Erie County Medical Center, with five still in critical condition. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into this devastating incident.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal report alleges that the Pentagon has, since late spring, blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms) to strike deep inside Russia. This move is reportedly part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin, reversing a previous Biden administration authorization for such strikes. The "review mechanism" also applies to British Storm Shadow missiles relying on US targeting data. While the White House denies a formal policy change, the decision aligns with Trump's past statements against escalating the war and comes amid increasing control over munitions to Ukraine due to depleted US stocks.</p>

          <p>North Korea's state media, KCNA, reported that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test-firing of two new air defense missiles with "superior combat capability" and "unique technology." This launch occurred hours after South Korea fired warning shots at North Korean troops who briefly crossed the Demilitarised Zone, an act Pyongyang called a "deliberate provocation." The test follows Kim's condemnation of recent US-South Korea joint military drills and his vow to accelerate nuclear weapons development. Senior South Korean officials have previously raised concerns about potential Russian missile technology transfers to Pyongyang, adding another layer to regional tensions.</p>

Despite some public frustration over a perceived lack of government action on larger petitions, the system provides a platform for citizens to influence the parliamentary agenda and put pressure on ministers, demonstrating that democracy extends beyond the ballot box.</p>

The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw Texas's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to bolster the party's majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, a move urged by former President Trump. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the new map dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation.

The ousting follows a DIA assessment that contradicted President Trump's claims about the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program after military strikes.

          <p>The US immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since President Donald Trump took office in January, marking the first decline in more than 50 years. A Pew Research Center study indicates the number dropped from 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June, with 750,000 immigrant workers leaving the labor force. This shift is attributed to Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, including mass deportations and restrictions on asylum, alongside earlier Biden administration policies.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, previously wrongly deported to El Salvador under the Trump administration despite a judge's protection order, is now facing a new threat of deportation to Uganda. Released from federal detention after being held since March, Garcia was subsequently informed by ICE officials that he should report for deportation to Uganda, a country where he doesn't speak the language and which has documented human rights violations. His defense lawyers are fighting this "preposterous" move, highlighting a Costa Rican offer for him to immigrate there legally. Garcia's case underscores the complex and often harsh realities of US immigration enforcement and its impact on individuals and families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning significant sentencing reforms that could allow courts in England and Wales to impose pub, concert, and sports match bans, as well as driving and travel restrictions, as part of non-custodial sentences. These changes aim to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending, aligning with recommendations for fewer custodial sentences for less serious crimes to address prison overcrowding. The Ministry of Justice intends to introduce legislation enabling broader restrictions for any offense, with breaches leading to further court action. Similar restrictions could also apply to offenders released from prison and supervised by the Probation Service, alongside increased mandatory drug testing.</p>

          <p>Protests across the UK against the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers led to clashes and arrests as anti-racism campaigners mounted counter-demonstrations. In Bristol and Liverpool, police in riot gear separated large opposing groups, with several arrests made for offenses including assault and affray. The demonstrations follow a High Court ruling blocking a hotel in Epping from accommodating asylum seekers, prompting other local authorities to consider legal challenges. The government is committed to closing asylum hotels in a managed way, but figures show a continued increase in asylum seekers housed in hotels, fueling ongoing public debate and social tension.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department released over 300 pages of transcripts from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence and appealing her conviction, denied witnessing any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton, and claimed Epstein's alleged "client list" does not exist. The interview, conducted under immunity, outraged the family of deceased accuser Virginia Giuffre, who accused the government of giving Maxwell a platform to "rewrite history." Maxwell also speculated that Epstein did not die by suicide, but rather from an internal prison situation.</p>

          <p>Major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are navigating the impact of President Donald Trump's increased tariffs, which are raising costs but have not yet led to widespread price hikes for consumers. Retail executives report employing strategies like diversifying sourcing and negotiating with vendors to mitigate the financial burden. While consumer spending remains steady overall, lower-income households are more sensitive to price adjustments. The article notes that strong brands and new revenue streams, such as advertising and third-party marketplaces, are helping companies like Walmart absorb costs. However, some brands, particularly those struggling or without strong customer demand, are facing tougher challenges. (not investment advice)</p>
