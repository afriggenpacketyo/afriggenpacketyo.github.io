          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock fell sharply after the company reduced its same-store sales forecast for the year, now expecting flat growth instead of a previously projected increase. The revision comes after traffic declined for a second consecutive quarter, with the company reporting second-quarter revenue and same-store sales below Wall Street expectations. Despite the downturn, which executives attribute to economic concerns affecting consumer spending, Chipotle noted a positive sales trend reversal beginning in June. The company maintains its long-term growth outlook and plans for new restaurant openings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Enterprise technology firm ServiceNow saw its shares climb after reporting strong second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. Driven by significant growth in its subscription revenues, the company raised its full-year financial guidance, citing accelerated adoption of its artificial intelligence products. CEO Bill McDermott highlighted that AI is refactoring business processes across all industries, contributing to the company's positive outlook. The company did note some uncertainty in its federal business due to potential budget changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates, propelled by strong performance in its Search, YouTube advertising, and Google Cloud segments. Despite the positive results, the company announced it will increase its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion, to a total of $85 billion, to meet growing demand for its cloud and AI services. CEO Sundar Pichai noted significant user growth for AI-powered products like AI Overviews and the Gemini app. The company's shares rose in after-hours trading following the announcement.

          <p>According to internal government data, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since the Obama administration. In the first six months of the Trump administration's second term, ICE recorded nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting an annual total over 300,000. While this figure represents a significant increase, it remains far below the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting operational constraints. The administration is also promoting self-deportation and has secured increased funding to expand enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in a U.S. court against conservative commentator Candace Owens. The suit addresses claims Owens promoted on her podcast that the first lady was born a man and assumed a false identity. The Macrons' legal team states the allegations are "demonstrably false" and were published in a pursuit of fame, not truth, after Owens allegedly ignored multiple retraction demands. In response, a spokesperson for Owens framed the lawsuit as an attack on First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>July 24 has been designated as Earth Overshoot Day for the year, the date when humanity's demand for ecological resources exceeds what the planet can regenerate in that year. According to the Global Footprint Network, this year's date arrived more than a week earlier than last year's, partly because new data shows oceans absorb less CO2 than previously thought. The trend of overconsumption, which began in the 1970s, leads to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Experts stress the need to shift from an extractive to a regenerative economy to address this growing ecological debt.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon known as "corn sweat" is significantly contributing to the oppressive humidity experienced during Midwest heat waves. The term describes the process of evapotranspiration, where vast fields of corn release large amounts of moisture into the air as they transpire to stay cool. While this process can have a slight cooling effect, the massive increase in humidity it causes makes the air feel much hotter, elevating the heat index to dangerous levels. Agricultural scientists note that while native prairies also release moisture, corn monocultures can draw water from the soil more rapidly, impacting the local climate.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort to force the release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein has been stalled after House Speaker Mike Johnson sent Congress into its August recess, preventing a vote. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, a co-sponsor of the resolution, accused the Speaker of intentionally blocking the vote, which he believed would have passed. The resolution, which has gained support from both Democrats and several prominent Trump-aligned Republicans, calls for transparency while protecting victim identities. Supporters are now focused on gathering signatures for a discharge petition to compel a floor vote when Congress returns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury records from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, stating that legal precedent ties her hands and prevents disclosure. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's public push for transparency regarding the case. In a related development, a federal judge in New York also denied a request from convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell to review grand jury materials related to her case. The New York judge stated he would review the transcripts himself to determine what, if anything, could be shared.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump was informed by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May that his name appears in Department of Justice documents concerning Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing allegedly occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the files to the public, a reversal that drew criticism from some of Trump's supporters. According to the report, the president was also told that many other high-profile individuals were named and that the files contained unverified information. A White House spokesperson dismissed the story as a continuation of "fake news."</p>

          <p>Climate advocates have expressed outrage over the Trump administration's new AI Action Plan, which they argue prioritizes corporate interests at the expense of the environment. The plan proposes to fast-track the development of the energy-intensive AI sector by removing environmental regulations and streamlining permits for data centers and fossil fuel infrastructure. Critics highlight that the AI industry already has a massive carbon footprint and consumes vast amounts of electricity and water. They accuse the administration of promoting a "thinly veiled invitation" for corporate exploitation while ignoring the severe climate consequences of unchecked AI expansion.</p>

The department stated that it needs time to adjust its systems to correctly calculate payment counts under the new legal constraints. The hold is not expected to affect borrowers who are still years away from forgiveness eligibility.</p>

Despite being in open water, the surfer was able to escape and make it to shore, where he received emergency medical treatment and is expected to recover.
