          <h2>Intelligence Report Assesses Iran's Nuclear Weapon Capabilities Before US Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 18:51:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. intelligence summary, issued on the same day as President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, assessed that Iran could potentially create a nuclear weapon within three to eight months, assuming no technical or logistical setbacks. However, the report did not indicate that Iran had made a definitive decision to pursue nuclear weapon development, aligning with previous U.S. assessments. The summary also revealed discussions among Iranian officials about concealing highly enriched uranium in public locations to prevent its destruction. Despite Iran's denial of nuclear weapon ambitions, the U.S. strikes targeted Iranian sites linked to "nuclear weaponization ambitions," according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with White House officials claiming the strikes obliterated Iran's capacity to build a nuclear bomb. The article provides insights into the intelligence community's understanding of Iran's nuclear capabilities leading up to the U.S. military action. </p>

          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that senior department officials discussed defying federal court orders and withholding information from judges regarding immigration priorities. Reuveni claims he faced threats and was eventually fired after raising concerns about instructions from top officials to disregard court orders and misrepresent facts in immigration cases. The complaint details an instance where an official allegedly suggested ignoring court orders related to deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Following Reuveni's public removal, Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that attorneys are required to zealously advocate for the United States, and any failure to do so will face consequences, while Reuveni's attorneys contend that the alleged actions have grave implications for due process and the rule of law. </p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the Trump administration's postponement of a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, calling it "outrageous" and "evasive." The briefing, initially scheduled to include briefers from the Department of State, Joint Chiefs, CIA, and DNI, was postponed to allow for the inclusion of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Schumer emphasized the need for transparency and factual information, particularly concerning the impact of recent strikes and the administration's long-term strategy. The postponement occurred as an early intelligence assessment suggested the attack did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program, further fueling calls for congressional briefings. </p>

          <p>Seven-time French champions Lyon have been relegated to Ligue 2 due to financial issues, despite raising around Â£45m through player sales and releasing high earners. The club intends to appeal the decision, asserting its ability to provide the necessary financial resources to guarantee its place in Ligue 1. Lyon has not played in the second tier since 1989 and reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2020. The club states that capital injections from shareholders and the sale of Crystal Palace have significantly improved its cash flow, providing sufficient financial resources for the 2025-26 season. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has authorized a $30 million grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US and Israeli-backed aid organization. GHF has preferential access to operate in Gaza, claiming it can deliver aid without Hamas interference. However, the rollout has been chaotic, with reports of deaths near distribution centers, resignations citing a "politicized" mission, and close ties to the Israeli government. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, argue that supporting GHF is a departure from established humanitarian organizations, while rights advocates warn that private contractors operating in Gaza risk complicity in international crimes. </p>

Despite the ceasefire, Middle East truces remain tenuous, and questions persist about Iran's enriched uranium supply and undisclosed research facilities.

          <p>A recent poll indicates that while Republicans largely support the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, overall public disapproval prevails, with concerns about a wider war. Most Americans believe President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action against Iran. There is bipartisan agreement that an Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S., but differing views on the effectiveness of the strikes. The poll also reveals a lack of confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation, with most Americans still perceiving the U.S. economy negatively. </p>

          <p>The prosecution and defense have rested their cases in the sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs. The prosecution presented over 30 witnesses, including former employees and girlfriends, alleging Combs coerced women into drug-fueled sexual encounters. The defense moved for acquittal, arguing the government failed to meet its burden of proof, but did not call any witnesses. Closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday, with the trial in its seventh week and the jury potentially beginning deliberations next week. </p>

          <p>This satirical article presents a humorous perspective from the viewpoint of God, who expresses detachment from serious global issues like war and poverty, focusing instead on trivial matters such as sports outcomes and awards show acknowledgments. God laments being dragged into the Trump administration's military actions in Iran, stating a preference for smaller, more self-serving tasks. The piece critiques the focus on superficial concerns while neglecting significant humanitarian crises. The author uses irony to highlight the absurdity of invoking divine support for political agendas. </p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, impacting 317 individuals, citing changes in California law and a desire to correct criminal behavior. The decision follows legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased, targeting Latino criminal organizations while ignoring white supremacist gangs. The move aligns Orange County with other California jurisdictions that have moved away from gang injunctions due to concerns over their broad scope and impact on civil rights. Spitzer said his office could seek new injunctions under the revised definition of gang activity if necessary. </p>

          <p>An early intelligence assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that the U.S. air campaign against Iranian nuclear sites set back Iran's nuclear enrichment program by only "a few months," contradicting President Trump's claim that it was "obliterated." The assessment revealed "limited" damage to critical infrastructure, particularly at the Fordo facility. Experts suggest that Iran's nuclear ability lies in its knowledge, which is difficult to attack, and that some critical aspects of the program remain untouched. The White House has disputed the assessment, maintaining that a key nuclear facility was destroyed. </p>

The author suggests Trump should have used the moment to secure a diplomatic agreement with Iran, including limits on its nuclear program and continued access for the IAEA.
