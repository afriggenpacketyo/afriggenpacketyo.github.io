          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is threatening a controversial effort to redraw the state's congressional maps to favor Democrats, a move intended to counteract a Republican plan to do the same in Texas. This proposal faces significant legal and political hurdles, as California voters previously established an independent redistricting commission to prevent such partisan gerrymandering. The debate highlights the escalating political hardball over electoral maps and questions the commitment to democratic norms when faced with partisan pressure from opposing sides.</p>

          <p>Netflix announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing by 16% to $11.08 billion. The company attributed the strong performance to healthy member growth, increased subscription pricing, and rising advertising sales. Consequently, Netflix has raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling confidence in its strategy despite no longer releasing quarterly subscriber data. The positive results underscore the success of its ad-supported tier and popular content slate in a competitive streaming market.</p>

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson is demanding that the National Archives release all records concerning former President Joe Biden's physical and mental health. Johnson alleges a potential "cover-up" of cognitive decline during Biden's presidency and is specifically investigating the use of an autopen to sign official documents, including pardons. This Senate probe adds to existing inquiries and reflects ongoing partisan scrutiny into the health and decision-making capacity of the former commander-in-chief.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to introduce legislation that would lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for all national elections. This reform, championed by the new Labour government, would enfranchise an estimated 1.6 million teenagers and is part of a broader effort to modernize UK democracy. The proposal aligns the entire UK with Scotland and Wales, where 16-year-olds can already vote in local elections, and has sparked a national debate on youth participation in politics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that he has persuaded Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup in its U.S. products. The news caused shares of corn syrup producer Archer-Daniels-Midland to fall, while Coca-Cola's stock rose. Coca-Cola's official response was noncommittal, stating that details on "new innovative offerings" would be shared soon. The move could significantly impact the agricultural and beverage industries.

          <p>In response to public speculation, the White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he noticed mild swelling in his legs. A memo from the president's physician described the condition as benign and common in individuals over 70, ruling out more serious issues like blood clots. The statement also attributed recent bruising on the president's hand to frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, asserting that he remains in excellent overall health.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that 23% of Americans over the age of 50 have decided to delay their retirement, a sharp increase from 14% last year. The primary drivers for this trend are economic volatility, concerns about inflation, and a lack of financial readiness for retirement. This finding provides a snapshot of the financial anxiety facing Gen X and older Americans, many of whom feel unprepared to stop working. (not investment advice)</p>
