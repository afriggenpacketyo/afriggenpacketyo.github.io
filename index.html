          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a surge following CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he would dedicate more time to the company, coupled with positive signals from the White House regarding potential easing of China tariffs. President Trump indicated that duties on China would not reach previously projected levels, and reaffirmed his support for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, alleviating investor concerns. Despite these positive developments, Tesla reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter results, including a significant drop in automotive revenue and net income, leading the company to reassess its 2025 guidance.

          <p>A dozen states have filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging the legality of his newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports. Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, the states argue that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the U.S. law cited by Trump. This legal action follows a similar lawsuit filed by a group of small businesses, both aiming to block the tariffs on the grounds that they exceed presidential power. The lawsuit underscores the growing legal resistance to Trump's trade policies. Optimism Score: 45</p>

The Indian government has not officially blamed any group for the attack but described the measures as a response to Pakistan's support of terrorist attacks on Indian soil. The decision was made at a cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as coffins of the civilians began arriving to emotional scenes. Optimism Score: 20</p>
