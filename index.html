          <p>People's Daily, a state media outlet in China, cautioned against local authorities implementing excessively strict austerity measures that hinder daily life and local economies. This warning comes a month after Beijing initiated its latest austerity campaign aimed at curbing corruption and wasteful spending. The commentary criticized some localities for equating the prohibition of illegal dining and drinking with a ban on all eating and drinking, which harms businesses and diminishes the vibrancy of everyday life. Beijing's austerity push includes measures like banning expensive dishes and extravagant decorations at official events, with central guidance teams dispatched to reinforce the message nationwide. The article suggests that overzealous enforcement stems from lazy governance and formalism, impacting citizens and businesses negatively. The current situation may require future adjustments to the current austerity campaign to improve the lives of citizens. </p>

          <p>Staff Sgt. Garrett Butts is leading an Army team in developing smarter, cheaper unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in-house to cut procurement costs and timelines. The team is building 3D-printed drones and testing low-cost, first-person view aircraft to provide soldiers with enhanced situational awareness and more accurate strike capabilities. One of the biggest challenges has been navigating strict procurement rules to legally obtain the necessary drone components, which took nine months to resolve. Butts believes drones give U.S. troops a major advantage, allowing infantry units to look over obstacles and deliver targeted strikes cost-effectively. The Army must work closely with the private sector and integrate artificial intelligence to further enhance drone capabilities and reduce the need for extensive operator training.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of requiring passports to reflect only the applicant's gender at birth. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that the policy likely violates the constitutional rights of transgender Americans by discriminating on the basis of sex. The ruling extends a previous injunction to include all transgender and non-binary U.S. citizens needing passport services. The policy, initiated under former President Joe Biden, allowed individuals identifying as non-binary, intersex, or gender non-conforming to select an 'X' gender marker. The Trump administration argued that the policy did not violate equal protection guarantees, but the court disagreed. The White House claimed the ruling was an attempt to thwart President Trump's agenda and push radical gender ideology.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe and foster political integration on the continent. The alliance operates as a collective security organization, with Article 5 of its charter stating that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. In response to NATO, the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact in 1955, but the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to several former Warsaw Pact countries joining NATO. NATO's open-door policy allows any European country that can enhance the security of the North Atlantic area to join, with Ukraine's ambition to join gaining pace amidst the ongoing war with Russia. Russia views Ukraine joining NATO as a red line, highlighting the alliance's continued relevance in contemporary geopolitics.</p>

          <p>Misti Leon is suing seven oil and gas companies for wrongful death, alleging they fueled the extreme heat that killed her mother in Seattle in 2021. The lawsuit claims companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP knew for decades that their fossil fuel products were altering the earth's atmosphere. The filing alleges the companies willfully created a fossil fuel-dependent economy resulting in more frequent and destructive weather disasters. If successful, the case could set a precedent for individuals to seek damages from fossil fuel corporations for their role in climate change. The plaintiff also seeks to have the defendants fund a public education campaign to rectify misinformation about the link between fossil fuels and planetary heating.</p>

          <p>The Senate and House are considering changes to the child tax credit as part of President Donald Trump's spending bill. The Senate bill proposes permanently increasing the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025, indexing it for inflation thereafter. The House bill suggests boosting the credit to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, then dropping it to $2,000 and indexing it for inflation. Some policy experts argue that the changes would primarily benefit middle and upper-income families. The final provision may change before Trump signs the package into law, with the ultimate outcome remaining uncertain.</p>

Wilder was unable to prevent the team's slide, culminating in conceding 101 goals and accumulating only 16 points during the season. Despite starting the previous season with a two-point deduction due to missed transfer payments, the team had challenged at the top of the division. A long-awaited takeover by COH Sports was finalized in December, and Wilder signed a new three-year deal in January, but the team's performance did not improve significantly.

          <p>A new study indicates that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species shift habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas. Many creatures could find new homes in parts of the North Sea predicted to become biodiversity hotspots within the next 50 years. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis should help the government ensure Marine Protected Areas continue to protect species as their habitats change.</p>

          <p>A new report from the CDC indicates that U.S. drug overdose deaths are rising again after a period of decline. The latest data shows fatal overdoses increased by roughly 1,400 deaths over the previous 12-month period. While still below the peak of 114,664 deaths in August 2023, the increase is concerning to addiction researchers. Experts suggest that the rise may indicate that factors contributing to recent declines in drug deaths are fading. The CDC data suggests roughly 82,138 deaths during the 12-month period ending in January 2025, with upticks primarily driven by increases in Texas, Arizona, California, and Washington.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions on environmental health appear to contradict the rhetoric of its "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda. While Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. highlights the dangers of toxic chemicals, the administration has cut funding for research and weakened environmental regulations. Federal workforce reductions have disrupted teams investigating toxic substances, and grants for relevant scientific work have been terminated. Experts note the contradiction between the administration's stated priorities and its actions, such as delaying drinking water standards on PFAS and proposing to lift regulations on mercury emissions. The EPA is prioritizing deregulation and staff cuts, raising concerns among scientists and advocates.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain current interest rates as policymakers assess the impact of President Trump's tariffs and Middle East tensions on the U.S. economy. The Fed has held steady since December, following a full percentage point rate cut last year. Investors are nearly certain the central bank will keep its benchmark interest rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. The Fed's rate-setting committee has acknowledged increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. Trump has been urging the central bank to cut rates more aggressively, but the Fed remains cautious due to concerns about inflation and the effects of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current interest rate policy, defying pressure from President Trump to cut rates. The Fed's decision reflects a wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their potential impact on the U.S. economy. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed and Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering rates more aggressively. The Fed is guided by a dual mandate to control inflation and maximize employment, but faces challenges in navigating the potential for stagflation caused by tariffs. Recent data shows inflation remains near its lowest level since 2021, while hiring has slowed but remains sturdy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK inflation remained at 3.4% in May, the highest for more than a year, while chocolate prices rose at the fastest pace on record. Food prices continued to climb for the third consecutive month, with some economists speculating that businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to customers. Chocolate prices have been particularly affected by bad harvests in cocoa-producing regions. The Office for National Statistics reported that chocolate prices rose by 17.7% in the year to May, the fastest pace since 2016. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices.</p>

Manchester City will play at home before five of their first six Champions League matches, but face four away fixtures directly after, which can be irritating for managers after a long midweek away trip.

The 10,400km route aims to reduce delivery times from 30-40 days by sea to 15 days. The corridor reflects deepening ties between China and Iran amidst geopolitical complexities, potentially enabling Iran to evade sanctions and bolster its regional influence. The overland route allows Iran to continue oil and mineral exports, reducing reliance on vulnerable maritime channels like the Strait of Hormuz. The rail corridor also positions Iran as a central transit hub, connecting China and Central Asia with Europe via Turkey.</p>

          <p>Tyler Perry is being sued for $260 million by actor Derek Dixon, who alleges sexual assault and harassment. Dixon claims Perry promised him a successful acting career but then subjected him to "escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation" when he did not reciprocate Perry's "unwanted advances". Dixon says Perry made it clear that if he ignored Perry or failed to engage with the sexual innuendos, Dixon's character would 'die' in the next season. Perry's attorney denies the allegations, stating that Dixon is attempting to set up a scam and that Perry will not be shaken down. Dixon ultimately left his role on The Oval and declined a job from Perry to work as a writer to stop continued harassment.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reduce duty liabilities amid rising tariffs. This involves altering an item's materials or dimensions to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Although most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products provide opportunities for companies to benefit through strategic design choices. The practice, which is not inherently illegal, allows companies to leverage product design to create different products subject to different tariff classifications and duty rates. Companies have to tread a fine line between redesigning their products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nintendo shares have surged 46% this year, adding approximately $39 billion to the company's value, fueled by the release of the Switch 2 console. The Switch 2 is the successor to the original Switch, and its launch has led to shortages in some markets. Nintendo sold 3.5 million units of the Switch 2 in the four days following its launch. Investors are optimistic that the Switch 2 will replicate the success of its predecessor, which has sold over 152 million units since its launch in 2017.</p>
