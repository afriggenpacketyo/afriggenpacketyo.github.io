          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 03:06:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party committee of UK members of parliament has criticized the Home Office for failing to know if foreign workers leave the country after their visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee reported that since the skilled worker visa route was introduced in 2020, the department has not analyzed exit checks, relying on outdated airline passenger data. This lack of curiosity and basic information gathering occurs alongside widespread evidence of worker exploitation, which the committee says the department has been slow to address. The new government has acknowledged the system is broken and plans to implement biometric checks and other measures to repair public trust.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is set to receive a substantial funding increase, potentially reaching nearly $40 billion by 2026, as part of a major tax and spending package. A significant portion of these funds is allocated for an 'initial investment' in the 'Golden Dome' multi-layered missile defense system, covering interceptors and advanced sensors. While the project's overall cost and viability have been questioned, it represents a major investment in achieving 'space superiority' and provides a boost for defense and space contractors. The bill also includes funding for Mars exploration, though it has drawn sharp criticism from figures like Elon Musk over its impact on national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are becoming a point of contention, with concerns that the Trump administration may use the event to expand federal authority. The event's designation as a National Special Security Event (NSSE), granted years in advance, gives federal agencies like ICE wide latitude, raising alarms about potential crackdowns on the city's large undocumented population. This situation is amplified by political friction between the administration and California's Democratic leadership. The article suggests this federal designation could transform the Olympics from a sporting celebration into a tool for advancing a hardline political agenda.</p>

          <p>Despite Chinese state media calling for tighter regulation of 'blind box' toys, analysts are confident that industry leader Pop Mart will remain resilient. The company's stock, which has surged over the past year, is expected to weather potential headwinds because its primary customers are young adults, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart is rapidly expanding its overseas sales, which already account for a significant portion of its revenue and are projected to grow substantially. The company's success highlights the 'dopamine economy' appeal of its products, though it still faces challenges like production delays and counterfeit goods.</p>

The UK Meteor Network (UKMON) tracked the object, which traveled from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and calculated that pieces could be found in a vast area between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht. Dozens of people reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang, with some residents near Ben Nevis feeling their houses shake. UKMON has appealed to the public, especially hillwalkers, to look for the meteorites, though acknowledges the search will be difficult in the remote, mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>The cancellation of a U.S. tax-free exemption for low-value goods has led to a double-digit decline in air cargo shipments from Asia. The 'de minimis' rule, which allowed packages valued under $800 to enter tax-free, was a significant boon for e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Since the rule was ended for shipments from China and Hong Kong, the volume of such packages has fallen sharply, with one estimate showing a 43% drop in May. This has prompted airlines to reduce freighter capacity on trans-Pacific routes as e-commerce shippers explore other markets like Europe and Latin America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Australian hearing-technology company Cochlear has introduced its new smart implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets to receive the device. Unlike traditional hearing aids that amplify sound, this implant works by bypassing damaged cells in the inner ear to directly stimulate the auditory nerve. The system is designed to help users with severe to profound hearing loss for whom conventional aids are no longer effective. The launch represents a significant step in bringing advanced hearing solutions to the large and growing Chinese market.</p>

          <p>A jury in Clackamas County, Oregon, has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault, unlawful sexual penetration, and sexual abuse. The charges stemmed from an incident at a 2021 house party where a 21-year-old woman said she was incapacitated from heavy drinking and unable to give consent. Prosecutors presented evidence showing the woman passed out, while the defense argued the encounter was consensual.

Their brief contends that such actions violate the separation of powers and threaten to cut off vital support for millions of students and teachers.
