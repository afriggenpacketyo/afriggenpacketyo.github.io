          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 10:03:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) as part of President Trump's tax package. The bill raises the SALT cap to $40,000, phasing out over $500,000, and increases it annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could face pushback in the Senate, as the previous SALT deduction was unlimited before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposed a $10,000 limit.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant drop after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. The bill ends tax credits for installers like Sunrun that lease equipment to customers, a practice used by 70% of the rooftop solar industry. Analysts described the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, significantly impacting companies like Enphase and SolarEdge. While the bill leaves manufacturing tax credits relatively unscathed, benefiting companies like First Solar, the Senate is expected to make changes to the legislation, indicating potential future revisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pause on tariffs on Chinese goods has led to a boost in imports, but retailers still face potential shortages and higher prices, according to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey. While some companies are restarting stalled orders from Asia, many retailers report that existing tariffs remain too high to complete full orders, leading to lower inventory and fewer product selections for consumers. The survey indicates that the majority of respondents are not seeing a full restart in holiday orders, and concerns remain about available ocean freight space. This uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to plan for the coming months, with many focused on lower-priced goods due to low consumer spending optimism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's revocation of Biden-era rules on artificial intelligence chips signals a more targeted approach to curbing China's technological development. Instead of broad restrictions, the new guidance prohibits the use of advanced Chinese chips and restricts the use of U.S. chips to train AI models in China. Analysts suggest this tactical approach, using trade tools and targeted controls, poses an existential challenge to China's long-term development goals. Renewed tensions in technology could add uncertainty to ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China, potentially complicating efforts to de-escalate tariffs.</p>

While South Africa has a high murder rate, statistics do not support claims of a "white genocide." Trump also played footage of people singing "Kill the Boer," an anti-apartheid song, but South African courts have ruled that the song does not directly incite violence.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether seniors should invest in gold, considering its high price, and it suggests that gold can protect a portfolio rather than aggressively growing its value. Gold can act as a hedge against volatility and diversify exposure, especially important for retirees with shorter investment timelines. However, gold does not produce income like dividends or interest, and seniors should be cautious of buying at elevated prices due to the potential for a pullback. Alternative ways to invest in gold include fractional gold investing and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart is laying off approximately 1,500 employees from its Global Tech team to increase efficiency and speed up decision-making. The layoffs will affect corporate employees, not store associates. The retailer aims to simplify its structure and adapt to the rapidly evolving technology landscape. As part of the restructuring, Walmart is eliminating some roles while also opening new ones, but the company had said earlier this month that it will raise prices in response to tariffs. Walmart earned $4.4 billion in the quarter ended April 30, down from $5.1 billion in the year-ago period.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Views on Race</h2>

          <p>President Trump publicly dressed down the president of South Africa based on a fringe conspiracy theory, providing a vivid distillation of his views on race. In the Oval Office, Trump said white people were “being executed.” He referred over and over again to “dead white people.” He dressed down Mr. Ramaphosa, who helped his country cast off the racist policies of apartheid, and questioned why he was not doing more when white people were being killed. The American president was not much interested in the answer, which is that police statistics do not show that white people are more vulnerable to violent crime than other people in South Africa.</p>
