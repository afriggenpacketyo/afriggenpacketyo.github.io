          <p>President Trump announced an end to U.S. subsidies for Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of encouraging massive drug production and calling him an "illegal drug leader." The decision follows Petro's accusation that a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean killed a Colombian fisherman, which he deemed a violation of his country's sovereignty. This move marks a significant escalation in diplomatic tensions, as the U.S. continues its controversial military operations against alleged drug-carrying vessels in the region.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly stated that the ongoing government shutdown, now in its 19th day, could be resolved this week if Republicans agree to negotiate on health care subsidies. In response, Republican Senator Katie Britt urged Democrats to reopen the government first before holding discussions.

          <p>Ed Miliband, the UK's Energy Secretary, has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills as a measure to combat the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he refrained from confirming any specific plans ahead of the chancellor's November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability challenges facing the country. This comes as the government faces pressure to reduce energy costs, which have remained high since the 2021 price spike.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has been federally indicted on charges of mishandling classified information, becoming the latest Trump critic to face legal action. However, legal specialists and former prosecutors suggest his case is distinct from those against figures like James Comey. They argue that while the timing raises questions of political motivation, the allegations against Bolton detail more serious misconduct over a significant period, potentially indicating a stronger and less politically driven case.</p>
