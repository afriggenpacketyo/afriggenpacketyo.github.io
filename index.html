          <p>The Trump Organization's merchandise website has begun selling 'TRUMP 2028' hats, sparking speculation about a potential third presidential run for Donald Trump, despite constitutional limitations. Trump himself has teased the possibility of running again, even suggesting scenarios involving J.D. Vance as a running mate. Legal experts have pointed out that the 22nd Amendment restricts anyone from serving more than two terms as president. Democrats have criticized the release of the hat, interpreting it as confirmation of Trump's intention to run again, while the Trump organization has been reached out to for comment.

          <p>The Israeli military has admitted that its troops mistakenly killed a United Nations worker in the Gaza Strip with tank fire, reversing an earlier denial of responsibility. The incident occurred last month when a UN compound in Deir al-Balah was struck, resulting in the death of a Bulgarian UN worker and injuries to others. The IDF stated that the building was targeted due to an assessed enemy presence but was not identified as a UN facility.

          <p>The man convicted of killing Maurizio Gucci, the Gucci heir, has been arrested on suspicion of shooting his own son. The elder Mr. Ceraulo, who is in his 60s, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an illegal weapon. The shooting occurred nearly 30 years after Ceraulo fatally shot Gucci, a crime orchestrated by Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani. Gucci, who inherited a significant portion of the family business, was killed outside his office in Milan in 1995. Optimism score: 10</p>
