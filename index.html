The finalists include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and Rick Rieder. Bessent is reportedly seeking a candidate with fresh perspectives on monetary policy and a willingness to reform the central bank's structure and mission.

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake followed by a 6.9 magnitude aftershock struck the southern Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and significant damage to infrastructure. The seismic events, caused by movement in the Philippine Trench, prompted authorities to issue and then retract tsunami warnings, causing evacuations in coastal areas. The powerful tremors led to landslides and damaged buildings, including schools and hospitals, as the nation grapples with another major natural disaster. Rescue and relief operations are currently underway to assess the full extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>A scientific debate is intensifying over the creation of "mirror life," synthetic organisms built with molecules that are mirror images of those found in nature. Proponents argue that mirror bacteria could revolutionize medicine by producing long-lasting therapeutics that our bodies wouldn't break down. However, a group of scientists has warned of potentially catastrophic risks, including the possibility that such organisms could evade immune systems and natural predators, potentially collapsing entire ecosystems. While the technology to create mirror cells is still decades away, the discussion highlights the need for proactive governance in biotechnology.</p>

          <p>During the trial of alleged stalkers of Kate and Gerry McCann, a court heard testimony from the organizer of a vigil for their missing daughter, Madeleine. The witness, Madeleine's great-aunt, described being "stunned" when Julia Wandelt, a woman who believes she is Madeleine, approached her at the event and tried to pass an envelope to the parents. This incident is part of a pattern of alleged stalking by Wandelt and her associate, who are accused of harassing the McCann family. The court was also presented with evidence of emails and recorded phone calls related to the case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is leveraging the ongoing government shutdown by threatening to permanently lay off thousands of federal employees, a departure from how previous shutdowns were handled. President Trump has indicated a desire to cut what he terms "Democrat Agencies," aligning with conservative goals outlined in plans like "Project 2025" to drastically reduce the federal workforce. This has prompted a lawsuit from labor unions, who argue the threats are illegal, and has led to what union leaders describe as the lowest morale ever seen among government workers.</p>

          <p>Postal workers across Canada have initiated strike action, disrupting mail delivery for millions and halting the acceptance of new parcels. The strike is a protest against government-authorized reforms at Canada Post that include ending door-to-door delivery for many homes and closing some post offices. The union argues these changes will lead to major job losses, while the government insists they are necessary to address the postal service's significant financial losses. The labor action, which has now shifted to rotating strikes, compounds an ongoing, unresolved dispute over pay and benefits.</p>

          <p>It was a difficult night for Philadelphia sports enthusiasts as three of the city's major professional teams all suffered defeats on the same day.

According to sports analysts, this marked the first time in over four decades, since October 1983, that all three teams have lost on the same day they played.

Waller, who is a finalist to become the next Fed Chair, stated that the central bank should not move aggressively in case it misjudges the direction of the economy. His comments suggest a more measured pace of cuts than some of his colleagues have advocated for. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that due to their long time horizon, young people should be less concerned with downside risk and should be fully invested in stocks to benefit from long-term compounding. Instead of holding cash or bonds, he advises using low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the broad market. This strategy allows time to recover from market volatility while maximizing the potential for significant growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Basketball Association is making a significant return to China with preseason games in Macao, marking a milestone in rebuilding its relationship with its second-largest market. The league's presence had been minimal since a 2019 political controversy, but it is now renewing partnerships, such as with Alibaba, to engage with its massive Chinese fanbase of over 425 million followers. This strategic push is seen as vital for the NBA's future growth, especially as it faces declining television viewership in the United States.</p>

          <p>Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. The move follows an investigation that concluded Google has substantial and entrenched market power, with over 90% of UK searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, this designation means the CMA can now impose legally binding conduct requirements on Google, potentially forcing changes to ensure fairer search rankings and greater control for content publishers.</p>

          <p>Japan's long-standing ruling coalition has fallen apart after the junior partner, Komeito, withdrew its support from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The decision was prompted by the LDP's failure to adequately address a persistent political slush-fund scandal. This dramatic development has thrown Japanese politics into turmoil and jeopardizes the confirmation of LDP leader Sanae Takaichi, who was on track to become the nation's first female prime minister. The collapse creates significant uncertainty as Japan prepares for major diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>Following anti-government protests in Tbilisi, Georgia's Interior Ministry has arrested 13 people, including rally organizers, accusing them of attempting to overthrow the government. The ruling Georgian Dream party has labeled the unrest, where some demonstrators tried to enter the presidential palace, as a coup attempt and has promised a policy of "zero sympathy" for the movement. This crackdown has heightened concerns among civil society groups that the government is using the events as a pretext for a broader campaign of repression against political dissent.</p>

Nvidia has stated that its own inquiry found no evidence of product diversion. The case could have significant implications for how the U.S. enforces its technology export restrictions.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans is set to affect a popular tax break for higher-earning workers. Starting in 2026, a provision from the Secure 2.0 Act will mandate that individuals who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year must make all their age-based catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. This change eliminates the option for these earners to make traditional pretax catch-up contributions, thereby removing the upfront tax deduction. Financial advisors suggest that affected workers should begin planning now for this shift in retirement savings strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, a group affiliated with Columbia University, has achieved a landmark legal victory against the Trump administration. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian students was an unconstitutional effort designed to chill free speech. The institute's defiant legal stance contrasts sharply with Columbia University's own more conciliatory approach to the administration, which recently involved a settlement over antisemitism claims. The ruling is being hailed as a crucial defense of fundamental constitutional principles.</p>
