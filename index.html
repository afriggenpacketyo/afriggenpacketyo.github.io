          <p>China's retail market is undergoing rapid transformation due to fierce competition in instant commerce, primarily between Alibaba and Meituan.

The intense battle aims to enhance efficiency and customer experience across both online and brick-and-mortar retail. This dynamic environment is reshaping consumer expectations, making speedy and affordable access to goods a new standard in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The Connecticut Republican Party has publicly condemned Democratic school board chairman Bill Beckert for allegedly celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder, citing a social media repost stating, "They Reap What They Sow." State GOP Chairman Ben Proto criticized Beckert for what he termed a "grotesque" endorsement of political violence, asserting that such behavior is unacceptable for an education official. Proto emphasized Kirk's non-violent advocacy for his beliefs and urged Farmington parents to consider the implications of Beckert's actions. This controversy underscores the heightened political polarization and rhetoric surrounding Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer initially defended Lord Mandelson's ambassadorship, despite officials at No 10 and the Foreign Office having prior knowledge of supportive emails between Mandelson and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The BBC reported that a media inquiry detailing these messages was sent to the Foreign Office, leading to Mandelson's dismissal when the "new information" became public. The revealed emails, including one where Mandelson expressed support for Epstein before his 2008 prison term, have sparked significant political pressure on Starmer regarding his judgment and the transparency of the appointment process.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has asserted that 52 political prisoners, recently freed in a US-brokered deal, were forcibly deported to Lithuania, rather than genuinely released. While welcoming their freedom, Tsikhanouskaya highlighted that many were nearing their sentence completion and are now separated from their families without travel documents. This prisoner release, which also involves lifting sanctions on Belarus' national airline, aims to improve US-Belarus ties. However, the opposition calls on Western governments to advocate for the right of political prisoners to remain in their home country.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have approved a Republican-backed redistricting plan, now awaiting the governor's signature, designed to potentially add another GOP-leaning House seat. This new map would reconfigure the state's congressional districts to seven Republican and one Democratic-leaning, a change from the current 6-2 split. The initiative, endorsed by former President Trump, is part of a broader national effort by Republicans to gain an advantage in upcoming midterm elections. However, the plan faces immediate legal challenges from groups like the ACLU, who allege it is unconstitutional, rushed, and constitutes racial gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>A Harvard study reveals a significant link between experiences of stalking or obtaining restraining orders and a higher risk of heart disease in women. Analyzing data from over 66,000 American nurses, researchers found a 41% increased cardiovascular disease risk for stalking victims and a 70% increase for those who obtained restraining orders, independent of other health factors. This highlights the profound, long-term health toll of interpersonal violence on women. The findings advocate for healthcare providers to incorporate questions about stalking and restraining orders into routine heart health screenings, aiming to enhance early detection and improve women's overall well-being.</p>

Trump even tied with Kamala Harris among young men, an 8-point improvement from 2020.

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA intends to dismantle the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has monitored emissions from over 8,000 industrial facilities since 2009. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin justifies the move by citing potential savings of $2.4 billion for businesses and reduced red tape, asserting compliance with the Clean Air Act. Conversely, environmental and health experts strongly contend that this action will obscure crucial climate pollution data, impeding informed policy-making and public health safeguards. This decision reflects the administration's broader strategy to curtail climate research and complicate assessments of emissions' societal impacts.</p>

          <p>A report by US House Republicans calls for the termination of approximately 50 US-China joint education programs, labeling them "high-risk." These partnerships, involving institutions like New York University and Johns Hopkins, are targeted due to concerns they could inadvertently support Beijing's military and technological advancements. Congressman John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, asserted that such collaborations "must end." This initiative intensifies the House Republicans' efforts to restrict academic ties, especially those connected to China's defense sector or intelligence-related applications, citing national security imperatives.</p>

          <p>Controversial artist Andres Serrano, renowned for works like "Piss Christ," discusses his decision to photograph convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump. Serrano captured Epstein's portrait in 2019, months before his death, driven by a desire to acquire a sculpture. He characterized Epstein as "uninteresting" beyond his crimes, noting his penchant for "collecting people." Serrano also photographed Trump in 2004, finding him "fascinating" and describing him as "the epitome of the American dream."

          <p>An undocumented Mexican immigrant, identified as 'Luz', shares her harrowing experience of living in constant fear in Trump's America, too afraid to leave her home or take her US-citizen daughter to school. Her narrative highlights the profound anxiety prevalent among Latino communities amid escalating ICE enforcement and "Operation Midway Blitz" raids, often conducted without warrants. Despite 17 years in the US, paying taxes, and contributing to society, Luz lacks a pathway to legal status. This aggressive policy shift, fueled by the administration's "stop the illegal invasion" rhetoric, compels families like hers to contemplate leaving their established lives.</p>

          <p>A film review for "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" indicates the sequel falls short of its predecessor's satirical genius, with its comedic impact diluted by numerous power cameos. While the initial exploration of the band members' solo lives offers some agreeable silliness, the film's essential oddball energy dissipates when the trio reunites for a forced arena show. The article criticizes the rehashed gags and overlooked comedic potential, concluding that despite the original cast's presence, the sequel feels more like a nostalgic revisit than a fresh, incisive commentary on rock 'n' roll excesses, ultimately weakening its satirical core.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration is permitted to end legal protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision overturns a lower court's stay, allowing the administration to proceed with terminating humanitarian parole for these groups as the broader lawsuit continues. The ruling is a significant win for the Trump administration, which contends that these protections were always temporary and that the Department of Homeland Security holds the discretion to revoke them. Critics, however, condemn the decision as the "largest mass illegalization event in modern American history," citing the potential for irreparable harm to affected families.</p>

          <p>The federal government has initiated a lawsuit against Uber, alleging widespread discrimination against passengers with disabilities, including those accompanied by service dogs. The Department of Justice claims Uber drivers routinely refuse service, levy illegal cleaning fees for service animal shedding, and deny front-seat access for individuals requiring space for mobility devices. These alleged practices have resulted in disabled passengers being stranded or experiencing significant delays. Uber, while denying the specific allegations, asserts that its policies prohibit such discrimination and that it actively addresses reported violations.

          <p>California lawmakers have successfully passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill designed to increase density near transit hubs by overriding local zoning laws.

Supporters emphasize its necessity for addressing California's housing affordability crisis, while critics express concerns about local control and community character.
