          <p>A town is in deep mourning following a tragic fire at Bicester Motion, which claimed the lives of two firefighters, Jennie Logan and Martyn Sadler, and a local businessman and father, David Chester. The community held a two-minute silence to honor the victims, and the Bicester Town Council is opening a book of condolence. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the fire, with police indicating it could be a complex and lengthy process. The loss has profoundly impacted the town, particularly the Bicester Rugby Union Football Club, where Logan and Sadler were actively involved, and the Bicester Motion estate, where Chester's family business was a long-standing fixture.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, secured the Romanian presidency after a closely contested race against right-wing nationalist George Simion, leader of the AUR party. Dan's victory, with 53.6% of the vote, followed months of political turbulence, including an annulled presidential race due to Russian interference allegations. Supporters celebrated Dan's commitment to fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion, who attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv, initially contested the results before conceding. The article also highlights the strong support Simion received from diaspora voters in Western Europe, reflecting broader discontent with mainstream parties in Romania.</p>

          <p>Professor Benjamin Horton, the new dean of City University of Hong Kong's energy and environment school, views China as a pivotal force in climate science. Horton cites China's substantial funding, advancements in green technology, and governmental support for environmental research as key factors. He contrasts China's proactive investments in green initiatives and reforestation with the pullback observed in other countries. Horton's decision to relocate to China reflects his belief in the nation's potential to drive significant progress in addressing climate change, leveraging its superpower status and pro-environment stance.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered widespread sexual assault of children within South Africa's illegal mining operations. Miners interviewed described instances of child miners, some as young as 15, being sexually assaulted by adult miners in exchange for gold or protection, while some children are specifically trafficked for sexual exploitation within the mines. The investigation highlights the vulnerability of these children, many of whom are foreign nationals, and the failure of authorities to address the abuse. Activists and researchers emphasize the need for urgent intervention to protect children from exploitation and trafficking in the illegal mining industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are projected to decrease in July, reversing a trend of consecutive increases in the regulator Ofgem's price cap. Cornwall Insight analysts predict that the annual energy bill for a typical household will decrease by Â£129, a nearly 7% reduction. This forecast comes after household bills increased in April, and it would result in a typical annual bill of Â£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. The price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, so total bills still depend on consumption.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice because he receives ample amounts from supporters, amid rising rice prices impacting households. Eto's comments, made at a fundraising event, coincided with his ministry's efforts to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. Despite signs of stabilization, average rice prices have roughly doubled compared to last year due to a poor harvest. The government has been criticized for its delayed response in releasing stockpiled rice, and public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the issue is high.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times argues that China is rapidly outpacing the United States in technology and innovation, potentially leading to a "Chinese century." The author contends that President Trump's policies, including tariffs and cuts to research funding, are undermining American competitiveness while China invests heavily in cutting-edge technologies like AI and robotics. The article highlights China's dominance in various industries, from steel to electric vehicles, and warns that America risks becoming a diminished nation focused on domestic consumption, while Chinese factories reshape global supply chains.

The bill permanently extends existing income tax cuts, adds temporary new ones, and proposes increased spending for border security and defense.

With a range of 7,000km and an altitude of 15,000 metres, the jet-powered drone can release up to 100 units of loitering ammunition or small drones, including kamikaze UAVs, from its belly.

Amentha Hunt, the niece of the deceased, noticed the error while preparing her uncle for burial, but mortuary staff initially dismissed her concerns. The family waited three hours for the mortuary to correct the mistake, and they are now seeking legal action due to the emotional distress caused by the incident. The funeral home denies the allegations and plans to file a cease-and-desist letter against Hunt.</p>

          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, has spoken out, stating that his son changed after serving in Twentynine Palms. Richard Bartkus hadn't spoken to his son in over a decade and was unaware of his alleged involvement in the bombing, which is being investigated as an international act of terrorism. Investigators are examining Bartkus's online posts, which suggest anti-natalist beliefs, and are seeking public assistance in tracing his movements before the explosion. The father recalls his son's childhood fascination with how things worked, including making smoke bombs, but never anticipated such destructive behavior.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are employing an innovative method to track endangered water voles by feeding them edible glitter. Water vole populations have drastically declined, and tracking these shy creatures in the wild has been challenging. By adding edible, biodegradable glitter to their food, researchers hope to identify water vole habitats and movements through glitter found in their droppings. This information will help conservationists implement targeted measures, such as removing invasive species and fencing off riverbanks, to protect and support the water vole population.</p>

Researchers believe that the dinosaurs were migrating together when a catastrophic flash flood wiped out a large portion of the herd. The site provides a unique opportunity to study dinosaur biology and understand the ancient ecosystem of the region.</p>
