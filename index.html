          <p>Bishop T.D. Jakes is stepping down as the senior pastor of The Potter's House, a Dallas megachurch he founded in 1996 and grew to over 30,000 members. He has officially installed his daughter, Sarah Jakes Roberts, and his son-in-law, Toure Roberts, as the new co-senior pastors. This leadership transition has reportedly been planned for years and follows a significant health incident in late 2024 where Jakes suffered a heart attack during a service. Jakes will continue his work as chairman of the T.D. Jakes Foundation and head of his other media and outreach enterprises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to extend statutory bereavement leave to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, offering time to grieve without needing to use sick leave. While advocates and MPs have praised the move as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement, some small business owners have expressed concerns about the financial impact of staff taking additional time off.</p>

          <p>Alexa Nicholls Costa, a Boston-based nurse practitioner and aesthetician, is providing free assistance to her clients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) by administering their hormone injections. Having gone through the stressful process herself, Costa recognized the anxiety and potential for error many patients face with self-injections. She began offering the service after hours, helping more than 15 patients who have all had successful pregnancies. Costa is now collaborating with a fertility clinic to develop a program that would send trained nurses to patients' homes to administer the shots, aiming to reduce a major barrier in the difficult IVF journey.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates in the short term but signal future cuts, savers are questioning whether to lock in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) now. Financial experts suggest that opening a CD in July could be a strategic move to secure currently high yields before rates potentially drop later in the year. Key considerations include personal liquidity, as CD funds are locked for a set term, and financial goals. Experts also recommend strategies like CD laddering—opening multiple CDs with different maturity dates—to balance returns with access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

Key technologies include the BeiDou satellite network, which offers a global navigation service that rivals the US-run GPS and provides high-precision guidance for the Chinese military. Other developments with dual-use potential are anti-satellite weapons, spy probes, and reusable space planes. While Beijing maintains its space program is peaceful, these technological gains significantly enhance the operational capabilities of the People's Liberation Army, from communication to munitions guidance.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value dropped approximately 8% after CEO Elon Musk announced his intention to create a new political party called the "America Party." This move has renewed investor anxiety about his political entanglements, which they fear could distract from the company's operations and negatively impact the brand. Analysts note a growing sense of exhaustion among many Tesla shareholders regarding Musk's political activities, viewing it as a diversion during a critical period for the company. The announcement also drew criticism from President Trump, with whom Musk has previously clashed over policy.</p>

          <p>Polish authorities have begun conducting random checks at 52 border crossings with Germany, a measure that deviates from the EU's visa-free Schengen zone principles.

This move follows Germany's reintroduction of stricter controls on its side of the border in late 2023. While EU rules permit temporary border measures in exceptional situations, the actions highlight growing friction over migration management within the European Union.</p>

          <p>Following the catastrophic Texas floods that killed over 80 people, questions are mounting about the adequacy of emergency warnings. Local officials claim rainfall far exceeded forecasts, while a review shows the National Weather Service (NWS) issued multiple escalating alerts, including urgent "seek higher ground" messages via cellphone. However, local authorities in hard-hit Kerr County did not initiate their own alerts through the IPAWS system. The tragedy has also intensified concerns about NWS staffing shortages and budget cuts under the Trump administration, with critics arguing these have weakened the nation's ability to respond to severe weather events.</p>

          <p>Investors betting against Tesla are poised to make around $1.4 billion in paper profits after the company's shares fell 7.5%. The stock slump was triggered by CEO Elon Musk's announcement of plans to form a new political party, which amplified investor concerns about his focus and the company's stability. This event marks another significant payday for short sellers, who previously profited when discord between Musk and President Trump caused a major drop in Tesla's market value.

          <p>Effective apologies from leaders require taking full responsibility, demonstrating genuine empathy, and presenting a clear plan for corrective action, according to communication expert Lorraine K. Lee. The timing of an apology is critical; leaders should acknowledge issues promptly and follow up with a thoughtful response. An apology that sounds rehearsed, lacks emotion, or fails to show vulnerability can erode trust and damage morale. Ultimately, people want to hear from a human leader, not a corporate brand, and a well-executed apology can be a powerful tool for rebuilding credibility and fostering positive change.</p>

          <p>China's strategy of expanding visa-free entry for citizens from dozens of countries has significantly increased foreign tourism in the first half of 2025. The policy has provided a much-needed boost to the nation's domestic consumption. Major cities have seen a dramatic rise in visa-free arrivals, with Beijing recording double the number from the same period last year. Shanghai's Pudong International Airport ranked as the top entry point for overseas travelers, with top sources of visitors including South Korea, Japan, the United States, and Russia, demonstrating the policy's early success.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix continues to lure top-tier directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Kathryn Bigelow, even though the company largely forgoes wide theatrical releases. The streaming giant attracts this talent by offering substantial financial backing, significant creative freedom, and access to a global subscriber base of over 300 million. For many filmmakers, Netflix provides a home for projects that traditional studios might deem too expensive or risky. By avoiding the high marketing costs of theatrical runs, Netflix can invest heavily in production and secure deals that are difficult for creatives to refuse.</p>

The author recounts a personal journey of trying to eliminate plastic from their home, only to realize its ubiquity in everyday items. While the full long-term effects are still being studied, research links plastic exposure to a range of health issues, including cancer, immune suppression, and developmental problems. Experts advise practical steps like avoiding processed foods, using HEPA filters, and choosing natural fibers to reduce exposure.</p>

          <p>A CNBC report explores the severe risks associated with the spiraling U.S. national debt, which is currently on a trajectory to add trillions more to the deficit over the next decade. Prominent economists and investors warn that persistent deficits could trigger a crisis, impacting markets, the economy, and national security. Potential consequences include high inflation, reduced private investment, and a diminished ability to respond to emergencies. Experts from the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate the U.S. has less than 20 years to correct its fiscal path before even drastic measures may be insufficient to prevent a default.

The EU fined the tech giant in April for breaching the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by restricting app developers from informing users about cheaper offers outside the App Store. In its appeal, Apple argues that the Commission is overstepping its authority by mandating how the company runs its store with terms that are confusing for developers and harmful to users. The company stated it will present its facts to the court, escalating the high-stakes battle over EU tech regulation.</p>
