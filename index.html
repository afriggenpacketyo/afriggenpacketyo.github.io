            <p>China's urban centers are facing new economic challenges as population decline accelerates, impacting businesses reliant on demographic growth. Cities like Chengdu, which have successfully attracted migrants, experience stable business environments, while others, particularly in northeastern provinces and Beijing, struggle with shrinking consumer markets and workforces. This demographic shift affects various sectors, including the wedding photography industry, where marketing strategies are now influenced by population changes. The broader implications include abandoned infrastructure and reduced fiscal revenues for local governments as the nation grapples with its population crisis.</p>

The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, seek a reduced sentence that could make them eligible for parole, citing years of abuse. The current DA attempted to withdraw the motion filed by his predecessor, arguing the brothers haven't fully taken responsibility. The decision allows the proceedings to continue, with another hearing scheduled for April 17, offering the brothers a potential path to freedom.</p>

            <p>Experts warn that a prolonged trade war between the US and China could have devastating consequences for African economies. US tariff policies could significantly impact African exports, particularly from resource-rich countries like South Africa and Nigeria. Lesotho, Madagascar, Botswana, Angola, and South Africa have already been heavily affected by Trump’s tariffs. Although Trump paused the tariffs for 90 days for most countries, he has increased tariffs on China, which could indirectly harm Africa if China's economy falters.</p>

            <p>President Trump told reporters that he underwent a cognitive test during his recent physical examination and claimed to have answered every question correctly. He stated that the test was part of a series of examinations related to his heart and other health aspects. This is not the first time Trump has taken a cognitive test; he previously recounted acing a similar test during his first White House physical in 2018. While presidents are not obligated to disclose their medical records, Trump's claim comes amidst ongoing discussions about the health and cognitive abilities of political leaders.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles court has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite opposition from the district attorney. The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking a lesser sentence that could make them eligible for parole. Their attorneys argue that the brothers have rehabilitated themselves during their 35 years in prison by completing schooling and starting rehabilitation programs. The judge emphasized the importance of maintaining consistency, even with shifts in leadership, and ruled that prosecutors failed to show why the resentencing effort should not continue.</p>

While declining to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" his return, the justices noted that the lower court may have exceeded its authority. Garcia, allegedly a gang member, was deported under an arrangement between the US and El Salvador. The government conceded the deportation was an "administrative error," but maintained Garcia's gang affiliation, which his lawyer denies.</p>
