          <p>Habibur Masum, 26, has admitted to the manslaughter of his wife, 27-year-old Kulsuma Akter, in Bradford, but denies the charge of murder. Masum stabbed Akter as she was pushing their baby in a pram through the Westgate area of the city on April 6 of last year; the baby was unharmed. Masum, of Leamington Avenue, Burnley, entered his plea at Bradford Crown Court and is scheduled to stand trial on the murder charge, as well as two counts of assault by beating and one charge of stalking. The case has drawn significant attention due to the violent nature of the crime and the vulnerability of the victim. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro, stating that these medications may affect the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, ranging from one to two months depending on the specific drug. There are concerns that the increasing popularity of these "skinny jabs" may lead to unsafe usage and inadequate medical advice, particularly given side effects like vomiting and diarrhea which can impact pill absorption. The MHRA recommends women consult their prescribers about the risks and benefits, and pharmacists for advice if confused about stopping the drugs. The article details a personal anecdote from a woman who became pregnant while on Mounjaro and taking the contraceptive pill, highlighting the potential risks. The MHRA has received around 40 reports related to pregnancy through its Yellow Card scheme, prompting the new guidance. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new travel ban affecting nationals from 12 countries, citing national security risks, with partial restrictions imposed on seven additional countries. The ban, which is scheduled to take effect on Monday, includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Exemptions are provided for athletes traveling for major sporting events, holders of immigrant visas for persecuted ethnic and religious minorities in Iran, Afghan nationals holding Special Immigrant Visas, lawful permanent residents of the US, and dual nationals. The White House stated that these restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, referencing a recent alleged terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, as justification. The order calls for periodic review, and the Secretary of State may grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis if it serves a US national interest. </p>

          <p>China has granted approval for the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, produced by the state-owned Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC).

The announcement comes shortly after the United States imposed new export restrictions targeting China, including curbs on jet engine-related technologies. Li Gaiqi, chief designer of the AES100, stated that the license reflects China's ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines. </p>

          <p>With forecasts indicating an "above-normal" Atlantic hurricane season, experts are urging homeowners to review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts a 60% chance of above-normal activity, with 13 to 19 named storms expected. Experts recommend assessing policy limits to cover rebuilding costs, checking deductibles, and determining the need for flood insurance, as standard homeowners policies typically do not cover flood damage. Acting promptly is advised, as insurers often suspend policy changes when a storm is imminent. </p>

          <p>A new study indicates that leprosy, or Hansen's disease, existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European explorers. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris found evidence of the bacterium Mycobacterium lepromatosis in ancient human remains from Argentina and Canada, dating back 1,000 years. This discovery challenges the previous belief that leprosy was solely introduced to the Americas by European settlers. The study, which involved collaboration with indigenous communities and various international institutions, analyzed over 800 DNA samples from ancient human remains and recent medical cases showing signs of leprosy. The findings suggest that Mycobacterium lepromatosis spread rapidly throughout the continent and that unknown animal reservoirs may exist. </p>

The incident occurred during the reading of a controversial bill that would have rewritten a 185-year-old treaty between the British crown and Indigenous Maori tribal leaders. Lawmakers were concerned that the haka, traditionally used to welcome visiting tribes or animate warriors, was performed in a manner that could intimidate members of the house. </p>

However, some of these efforts have been canceled, and others face an uncertain future, as President Trump has moved to eliminate equity programs and cut billions of dollars from FEMA's programs.

          <p>A BBC Arabic team was detained by Israeli forces in southern Syria while filming near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The team, consisting of British, Iraqi, and Syrian journalists, was stopped by soldiers who pointed rifles at their heads and confiscated their equipment. After being escorted to a crossing point, the journalists were interrogated and blindfolded, with one officer speaking fluent Palestinian Arabic. The BBC has complained to the Israeli military about the incident but has not yet received a response. </p>

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible and save parents Â£500 a year, potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated Â£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029. While the announcement has been welcomed by the education sector and organizations campaigning against child poverty, some critics argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective at reducing child poverty. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce lawyers report that their business is seasonal, with filings peaking in late summer and early spring. This pattern is attributed to couples delaying divorce proceedings until after major holidays and family events. A 2016 study from the University of Washington supports this observation, finding that divorce filings consistently peaked in March and August. However, some experts argue that sentimental reasons are not the primary driver, and that the average age of people getting divorced is increasing, with a notable rise in "gray divorces" among those over 50. </p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts and program closures by the Trump administration at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could significantly impact asthma programs nationwide. Experts fear that these cuts could result in more emergency room visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities. The potential closure of the CDC's National Asthma Control Program and cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies are raising concerns about the disproportionate impact on at-risk populations.

          <p>An EU drug report reveals a growing trend of synthetic drug use in Europe, with substances like cathinones increasingly produced locally. Researchers lack sufficient knowledge about the long-term health risks associated with these synthetic drugs, which are often potent and ever-evolving. Cocaine remains Europe's most popular illicit stimulant, and wastewater analysis indicates that urban patterns of drug use are spreading to smaller towns. Additionally, the report highlights a rise in deadly synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and nitazenes, driven by a ban on opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. </p>
