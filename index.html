            <p>A Louisiana district attorney is pursuing the death penalty against Thomas Sanders, convicted in 2014 for the kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Lexis Roberts. Sanders' death sentence was commuted to life in prison by former President Joe Biden, a decision the DA calls an "outrageous" abuse of clemency power. The DA presented the case to a Catahoula Parish grand jury, which indicted Sanders on state charges related to the brutal crime, which involved the murder of the girl's mother and subsequent kidnapping across state lines before the child's death.</p>

            <p>Global Payments' shares plummeted after announcing its acquisition of Worldpay for over $24 billion while simultaneously selling its Issuer Solutions business to FIS. The acquisition aims to expand Global Payments' reach to over 6 million customers across more than 175 countries. However, the sale of its Issuer Solutions unit, a stable provider of growth, has raised concerns. The company plans to issue $7.7 billion of debt to finance the acquisition and refinance Worldpay's debt. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The article discusses the differing approaches to literature of the working class between the U.S. and France, with a focus on the recent novel "On the Clock" by Claire Baglin. While American literature often examines white-collar office jobs with a critical lens, French literature tends to focus on blue-collar labor, often through memoirs or autofictional works. Baglin's novel explores the indignities of working in a fast-food restaurant, highlighting the subjectivity and individuality of working-class concerns.</p>

            <p>SpaceX and its partners, Palantir and Anduril, are leading contenders to construct key components of President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense shield. The plan involves launching hundreds of satellites to detect and track missiles, with a separate fleet for interception. SpaceX proposes a subscription-based model for the government's access to the technology, potentially expediting deployment but raising concerns about long-term control and pricing. The project could mark a significant win for Silicon Valley in defense contracting.</p>

            <p>For the first time in five years, American attitudes towards China have softened compared to the previous year, with a significant drop in the percentage of those who view China as the “enemy”, according to a survey released by the Pew Research Centre on Thursday. Overall attitudes remain overwhelmingly negative at 77 per cent, but the percentage of respondents with “very unfavourable” views towards China decreased by 10 points from last year, to 33 per cent. Now, only a third of Americans believe China is a US “enemy” rather than “partner” or “competitor”, compared to last year’s record-high 42 per cent.</p>

The Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a microelectrode array thinner than a human hair, can monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain's surface. The FDA authorized its implantation for up to 30 days, allowing Precision to market the technology for clinical use and gather data for BCI development.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission said the decision would result in an updated code of conduct for services, including the NHS and prisons, potentially affecting spaces such as hospital wards, changing rooms and domestic refuges. The Scottish government had argued that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.</p>
