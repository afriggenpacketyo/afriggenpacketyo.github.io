          <p>Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, was abruptly fired from her role as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. The article details her career, including her graduation from Harvard Law and her role in high-profile prosecutions against Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her dismissal is widely seen as politically motivated by President Trump's long-standing animosity towards her father, echoing the circumstances of his own firing in 2017 amid a sensitive investigation.</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Propose Classifying Extreme Heat as a Federal Disaster</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 15:25:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, with some Republican support, has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local governments to access federal FEMA funding for heat-related emergencies, such as establishing cooling centers and undertaking heat adaptation projects like planting trees. The move follows a record-breaking June heat dome but faces opposition from some, including a former FEMA administrator who argues that heat is already eligible and that mitigation grants are a more appropriate tool.</p>

          <h2>Labour MP Diane Abbott Suspended Over Renewed Comments on Racism</h2>

          <p>Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the party pending an investigation into her recent comments on racism. In a BBC interview, she reiterated her controversial view that racism against Black people is distinct from prejudice experienced by Jewish, Irish, and Traveller communities, as it is based on visible skin color. This doubles down on remarks that led to a previous year-long suspension, drawing criticism from colleagues, including Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, for failing to retract her original stance.</p>

          <p>An Iranian citizen and chiropractor, Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents outside his child's preschool in Beaverton, Oregon. The arrest, which involved officers breaking his car window, occurred after a traffic stop, with ICE stating he had overstayed his visa. This incident marks the first confirmed federal immigration arrest at an Oregon school since the Trump administration overturned a policy that restricted enforcement actions at sensitive locations like schools and hospitals.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria, targeting both government buildings and troops, mark an escalation in its military campaign following the overthrow of Bashar Assad. Analysts suggest Israel's goals are twofold: to create an informal buffer zone in southern Syria and to ensure the nation remains too weak to pose a threat. While Israel officially states its actions are to protect the Druze minority, some experts believe the timing is politically motivated to distract from Prime Minister Netanyahu's domestic pressures, including his corruption trial and fragile coalition government.</p>

          <p>Disneyland is celebrating its 70th anniversary, marking seven decades since it opened in 1955 and revolutionized the amusement park industry with its immersive, story-driven attractions. Despite a famously disastrous opening day, the park grew into "The Happiest Place on Earth" and now ranks as the world's second-most visited theme park. The Anaheim resort, which has expanded to include California Adventure Park, continues to evolve with new attractions like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge while maintaining many of Walt Disney's original touches.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinner, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount from its list price. This direct-to-consumer (DTC) model allows the pharmaceutical giants to bypass pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the industry middlemen who negotiate rebates. Analysts believe this move may not negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated, and could generate goodwill with the Trump administration amid scrutiny over drug costs.

          <p>A new report claims that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's administration diverted millions of dollars from disaster preparedness funds to construct a controversial migrant detention facility in the Everglades. Critics, including Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, have condemned the move as irresponsible, especially as hurricane season peaks, and noted that some contracts went to DeSantis's political donors. The controversy deepened with revelations that a 15-year-old boy was mistakenly held at the facility, which authorities had claimed would only house adults.</p>

          <p>The White House is seeking an on-site inspection of the Federal Reserve's headquarters, escalating pressure on the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell. This move follows President Trump's unsubstantiated suggestions of fraud related to the building's $2.5 billion renovation costs. The scrutiny is part of a broader campaign by Trump to undermine Powell, whom he has repeatedly threatened to fire for not lowering interest rates, despite the Fed's mandate to operate independently of political influence to maintain economic stability.

This alliance, which aims to launch in a major U.S. city next year, positions Uber to compete more directly with rivals like Waymo in the burgeoning driverless ride-hailing market.

While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, promising "new innovative offerings," the announcement impacted the market and drew a response from the Corn Refiners Association, which warned of potential job losses. The move aligns with the Trump administration's broader push for food companies to reformulate products with what it considers to be better ingredients. (not investment advice)</p>

The leak, which was kept secret by a court injunction until recently, occurred when an employee at UK Special Forces headquarters inadvertently emailed a database of applications to an individual outside the government. The breach put thousands of Afghans at risk of Taliban reprisals and forced the government to create a covert resettlement scheme for those affected.</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who tried to shut down a passenger jet's engines mid-flight, described the incident as the result of a dissociative state induced by "magic mushrooms." In a recent interview, Emerson explained he was grieving a friend's death and, believing he was in a dream, pulled the engine fire suppression handles in an attempt to "wake up." The case has highlighted the significant barriers pilots face in seeking mental health care, prompting calls for FAA policy reforms to destigmatize and facilitate treatment without automatically ending careers.</p>
