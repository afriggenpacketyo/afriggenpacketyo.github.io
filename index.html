            <h2>Trade Group Doubts Trump's Tariffs on Cambodia Will Bring Manufacturing Back to the U.S.</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Despite the Trump administration's goal of reshoring manufacturing by imposing a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods, a trade group representing U.S. interests in Cambodia believes this is unlikely to happen. The American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia suggests that manufacturers will look to other countries like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia to mitigate the tariffs. Experts warn that relocating supply chains requires significant investment and companies are likely to pause decision-making amid uncertainty. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argues that tariffs will generate revenue as manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S., but supply chain consultants are skeptical about a quick return of manufacturing to America.</p>

CEO Tim Wentworth acknowledged the turnaround plan is in its early stages and requires time and investment to navigate the changing pharmacy and retail landscape. The company reported a net loss of $2.85 billion, including a $4.2 billion charge related to its U.S. retail pharmacy and VillageMD investment, but benefited from gains from its investments in Cencora and BrightSpring.

            <p>The Trump administration has dismissed Navy Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield from her position at NATO, following recommendations from a conservative group that aimed to remove leaders perceived as promoting 'woke' policies. Chatfield, one of the few female three-star officers in the Navy, was reportedly told the administration wanted to go in a different direction. This move is part of a broader effort by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to eliminate DEI programs and leaders, with the American Accountability Foundation citing a 2015 speech by Chatfield as justification for her removal. Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed have criticized the decision, describing it as a politically motivated attack on military officials.</p>

China has vowed to "fight to the end" and imposed tariffs on U.S. products, prompting Trump to threaten additional tariffs if China does not withdraw its measures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Beijing has warned that there can be "no winner in the trade war and the tariff war" as President Trump's tariffs against U.S. trading partners continue to roil world markets. Trump has stated he is not considering pausing the tariffs to allow for negotiations. A senior White House official has indicated that additional tariffs on China could reach a total of 104% if retaliatory measures continue.</p>

            <p>As Birmingham's bin strike enters its fifth week, the health secretary has voiced concerns about the impact on public health due to unsanitary conditions. Piles of rubbish have become a common sight on Birmingham's streets and the health secretary said it was "not acceptable" that the bin strike was causing "unsanitary conditions" on the streets of Birmingham. Talks between bin workers and the city council have ended without an agreement. With the backlog of waste growing, neighboring Lichfield District Council is set to assist in clearing it.</p>

            <p>China has announced plans to become a “strong agricultural country” by 2050, aiming to improve standards in farming supplies, scientific and technological equipment, and industrial resilience. This plan, jointly released by the Communist Party’s Central Committee and the State Council, comes as Beijing prioritizes food security amid global economic uncertainties and an intensifying trade war with the U.S. The plan is hindered by a big income gap between cities and the rural areas where a third of its 1.4 billion people live.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced that the US and Iran will hold "direct talks" over a possible new nuclear deal, however, hours after the surprise announcement, Iran's foreign minister said the talks in Oman would be "indirect" but could be "as much an opportunity as... a test". The announcement follows previous statements from Trump about wanting a deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and avert potential US military action. Iran has also stockpiled enough enriched uranium to make several bombs. Trump insisted that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and said the country would be in "great danger" if the talks were not successful.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences announced that it used "deft genetic engineering and ancient DNA" to breed three dire wolf puppies and to "de-extinct" the species. However, independent experts say these animals are "genetically modified grey wolves" and not actually dire wolves, pointing to significant biological differences between the two species. The company extracted DNA from fossilised remains and inserted them into the genetic code of a living grey wolf. Experts point out that ancient dire wolf DNA is too degraded and damaged to biologically copy or clone.</p>

            <p>Celebre d'Allen, a 13-year-old horse, died after collapsing at Aintree following the Grand National race. The horse received medical treatment but his condition deteriorated significantly. Micheal Nolan, the rider, received a 10-day suspension. The death has prompted criticism from animal rights groups, who blame the sport of horse racing itself. The British Horseracing Authority said it will analyse the race and incident in detail and send the horse for a post-mortem.</p>

The expanded roll-out of Teen Accounts is beginning in the UK, US, Australia and Canada from Tuesday.</p>

            <p>Senator Adam Schiff has introduced a bill proposing a federal tax credit for homeowners who retrofit and harden their homes against wildfires and other natural disasters. The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Tim Sheehy, would cover up to half the costs for qualified home upgrades, such as fire-resistant roofs and vegetation buffers, in states where federal disasters have been declared. The tax credit would be capped at $25,000 for families with an annual income of less than $200,000, with the cap indexed to inflation moving forward.</p>
