          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing concerns over violence, antisemitism, and collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard had failed to address these issues despite opportunities to do so. This decision follows previous actions, including freezing federal grants, after Harvard rejected demands to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and evaluate international students for ideological concerns. The move is a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the administration and the university over campus issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move that has ignited controversy due to questions about its legality. The waivers, granted by the Biden administration's EPA in 2024, allowed California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards, including the EV mandate requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, while Democrats contend that such a vote is illegal. California officials have vowed to challenge the decision in court, as the outcome is expected to impact cities and states nationwide that have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Expropriation Act, which allows the government to take private property for public use with fair compensation, has sparked international debate and controversy. The law aims to address historical inequalities in land ownership resulting from apartheid policies. While the ANC sees the law as a milestone, opposition parties challenge it in court, fearing threats to private ownership. The Trump administration has also weighed in, expressing concerns about the law enabling the seizure of agricultural property from ethnic minority Afrikaners. The situation draws parallels to land reform in Zimbabwe, which led to economic disaster.</p>

          <p>Hull's Royal Hotel, which has housed asylum seekers for five years, remains a divisive issue in the city. While some residents express sympathy for the asylum seekers, others voice concerns about the impact on the community. Last summer, the hotel became the focal point of protests, highlighting the challenges of using hotels to accommodate individuals arriving from France. Home Office figures indicate a decrease in asylum seekers housed in hotels, but the issue remains a defining one for many, with differing perspectives on the integration and support of asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced a budget bill with significant impacts on household finances, potentially making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent. The bill includes provisions to raise the SALT deduction limit, increase the child tax credit, and cut Medicaid and SNAP benefits. It also proposes a bonus deduction for older adults, expansions to health savings accounts, and the creation of "Trump Accounts" for child savings. Additionally, the bill seeks to reduce student loan benefits and create a car loan interest deduction, with a tax break on tip income. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement faced a legal challenge from Chagossians, who were not given a say in the islands' future. While the deal has been hailed as a victory by Mauritius, it has drawn criticism from UK opposition politicians, who question the cost and strategic implications.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that the sluggish nature of sloths has contributed to their evolutionary success. Scientists examined the evolutionary history of sloths, including extinct forms, and found that tree-dwelling sloths were better able to survive than their giant ground-dwelling counterparts, which were easier targets for human hunters. The research emphasizes the importance of conserving Earth's remaining sloth species, as they represent only a fraction of their evolutionary history. The study also highlights the adaptability of sloths in coping with climate changes.</p>
