          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated his belief that the artificial intelligence market is currently in an investment bubble, drawing parallels to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. While acknowledging AI's long-term importance, he warned that investors are overly excited about a "kernel of truth," a sentiment echoed by other financial experts. Despite these concerns and recent unprofitability, OpenAI is preparing for a secondary stock sale that would value the company at approximately $500 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

The primary concern among the envoys is the planned attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, especially as Moscow's attacks on Ukraine have intensified.

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Trump, has strongly criticized India for its continued purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the actions "opportunistic." In an op-ed, Navarro argued that India is effectively undermining international sanctions by acting as a "global clearinghouse" for Russian oil and urged the nation to act like a strategic partner to the U.S. This criticism follows the Trump administration's plan to impose additional tariffs on India, raising the total to 50%, as geopolitical tensions surrounding the war in Ukraine continue to impact global trade relationships.

          <p>The city of Helsinki, Finland, has successfully recorded zero traffic-related deaths in the past year, a significant achievement for a city of its size. Officials attribute this success to their "Vision Zero" program, which includes reducing speed limits to 30 km/h on most streets and redesigning infrastructure to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety. By leveraging data analysis to identify accident blackspots and increasing the use of speed cameras, Helsinki has created a model for other major cities aiming to eliminate traffic fatalities.</p>

This breakthrough provides proof-of-concept for using cell therapy to treat neuropsychiatric disorders by directly repairing dysfunctional neural circuits involved in mood regulation.
