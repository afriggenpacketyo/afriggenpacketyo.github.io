          <p>A new flood threat in Central Texas has forced emergency crews to suspend their search for the 161 people still missing from the catastrophic July 4th floods. The National Weather Service issued fresh flash flood warnings for Kerr County, the area most devastated by the initial event that killed at least 129 people statewide. Evacuations are ongoing as authorities monitor the rising Guadalupe and San Saba rivers, which are expected to crest higher than before due to continued heavy rain on saturated ground. This development complicates the massive recovery effort, which has involved volunteers, drones, and search dogs across the difficult terrain of Texas Hill Country.</p>

          <p>In Arizona, the Dragon Bravo Fire has destroyed dozens of structures in the Grand Canyon National Park, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and a water treatment facility, which caused a hazardous chlorine gas leak. This fire, along with the larger White Sage Fire, has burned tens of thousands of acres and forced hundreds to evacuate. Meanwhile, smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires is drifting across the United States, causing unhealthy air quality throughout the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Wisconsin. This combination of events highlights an intensifying wildfire season with broad impacts on both natural landmarks and public health across North America.</p>

          <p>A serious incident occurred at London Southend Airport when a 12-meter aircraft crashed shortly before 4:00 PM BST on Sunday, resulting in a large fireball. Eyewitnesses who were watching planes with their children described seeing the aircraft bank unusually hard to its left after takeoff before it inverted and hit the ground. The crash prompted the cancellation of at least four flights and a major response from emergency services, who are working at the scene. The airport confirmed the incident and stated it was working with local authorities, asking the public to avoid the area while the investigation and cleanup are ongoing.</p>

The targeted colonel, Ivan Voronych, was reportedly involved in covert operations in Russian-occupied territories. This event is the latest in a series of high-profile killings and attacks that both Moscow and Kyiv have attributed to each other's security services since the full-scale invasion began, escalating the shadow war between the two nations.</p>

He later rebranded as a "converted democrat" and won the 2015 presidential election on a platform of tackling corruption and insecurity. However, his two terms from 2015 to 2023 were marked by significant economic decline, widespread violence, and his own persistent health problems, leaving behind a complex and debated legacy.</p>

Many locals express a desire for their community to be remembered not for the violence, but for the way they unified in the aftermath. They particularly emphasize the support shown for the family of Corey Comperatore, the firefighter who was killed in the attack. While still stunned by the tragedy, there is a sense of pride in how the community came together, with some residents describing the people of the Pittsburgh area as "tough cookies" who remain resilient.</p>

The bill would grant the president broad authority to impose heavy tariffs, acting as a powerful tool to pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill aimed at pressuring Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The legislation would provide President Trump with a "sledgehammer" to target not only the Russian economy but also countries like China, India, and Brazil that support it by purchasing Russian goods. The bill would grant the president discretionary authority to impose tariffs of up to 500% on nations that prop up Russia's war machine. The move signals a potential turning point in U.S. policy as the administration's patience with Vladimir Putin appears to be wearing thin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unverified report from Iran's Fars news agency, which is close to the Revolutionary Guard, claims that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was slightly injured during an Israeli attack in June. The report alleges that bombs targeted a secret underground facility in Tehran where the president was attending a high-level security meeting, causing him leg injuries during an escape. This claim has not been independently verified, and Israel has not commented. The report raises questions about Israeli intelligence capabilities and potential infiltration, adding another layer to the high-stakes shadow war between the two nations, following Pezeshkian's recent accusation that Israel tried to kill him.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were scheduled to take effect, in hopes of negotiating a trade deal with the Trump administration. The decision provides a window for talks until August 1, after which President Trump has threatened to impose new 30% tariffs on European imports. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue to prepare countermeasures in case a deal cannot be reached. The move temporarily de-escalates a growing trade dispute that could have significant ramifications for the nearly €5 billion-a-day trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on deporting "the worst of the worst," government data reveals a different reality about ongoing immigration enforcement. According to the latest ICE statistics, the majority of people currently detained—over 71%—have no criminal convictions. Of those who do have convictions, a small fraction are for high-level violent crimes. This data highlights a significant disconnect between the administration's rhetoric about targeting dangerous criminals and the actual population being arrested and detained. Critics argue this narrative creates a false impression about immigrants and justifies enforcement actions that overwhelmingly affect non-criminals or those with minor offenses.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that the Trump administration intends to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rather than eliminate it. Her comments came amid widespread criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, including reports of unanswered calls to FEMA's assistance line. Noem defended the administration's handling of the crisis as the "best response" in years and dismissed critical reports as "fake news." This appears to soften previous rhetoric from both Noem and President Trump about phasing out the agency, shifting the focus to reforming how it deploys resources and supports states during disasters.</p>

Eyewitnesses reported that a drone fired a missile into the crowd. The Israeli military has since stated that the strike was targeting an Islamic Jihad militant, but a "technical error" caused the munition to fall dozens of meters away from its intended target, hitting the civilians instead. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it is reviewing the incident and expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians, highlighting the devastating civilian toll of the ongoing conflict.</p>

Despite the immense financial challenge, estimated at half a million dollars, and the increasing frequency of such disasters, the family's emotional connection to the property is driving their decision.

This assurance comes after a preliminary report into last month's fatal Air India 787 crash, which killed 260 people, raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches. The FAA's notification stated that it does not consider the switch design an "unsafe condition" that would warrant a mandatory airworthiness directive.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against a wave of criticism from some of his own supporters, including prominent figures like Elon Musk. The frustration stems from a recent Justice Department memo on the Jeffrey Epstein case which concluded there was no "incriminating client list" or evidence of blackmail against high-profile figures. This finding fell short of the major revelations that Bondi and others had previously suggested were forthcoming. In a social media post, Trump urged his supporters to "let Pam Bondi do her job" and not waste energy on the Epstein case, highlighting a growing rift within his coalition.</p>
