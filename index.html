          <h2>Conscious Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Encourage Children's Cooperation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on years of studying parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests that parents can foster cooperation by using specific phrases that respect a child's autonomy and emotional safety. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering learning and cooperation. Instead of using threats or demands, parents should explain their reasoning, acknowledge their child's feelings, and invite problem-solving. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children. The author's research suggests that the real secret to getting kids to listen is not about controlling their behavior, it is about creating conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported for suspected cyberstalking, prompting concerns about the normalization of digital surveillance. Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips emphasizes the need to educate young people about healthy online relationships as part of the government's violence against women and girls strategy. Constant monitoring and location sharing are becoming normalized from a young age, blurring the lines between care and control. Experts stress the importance of teaching children about meaningful consent and respecting boundaries in digital interactions, which can be hard to implement in reality.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, world leaders have issued a range of reactions, with Iran reserving its options for response and condemning the attacks as a violation of international law. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's decision as a historic moment, while China strongly condemned the attacks and called for de-escalation. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a dangerous escalation, and the European Union urged a return to negotiations. The situation remains tense as global leaders weigh the impact of the attacks on regional and global stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with B-2 Spirit bombers dropping bunker-buster bombs on Fordo. Trump warned Iran against retaliation, threatening further attacks if peace is not achieved quickly, which is in light of the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East. The U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically to clarify that the strikes are the extent of planned actions and regime change is not the goal.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns are rising about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz.

Disruption of oil flow through the strait could severely impact international energy markets and economies, potentially driving up oil and gas prices. The U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait, but an Iranian effort to block it could trigger backlash from countries heavily reliant on the route.</p>

Washington's decision to act alone meant that a massive decision from the UK Prime Minister was not needed, but some of these trade-offs could soon return depending on if, how, and when Iran chooses to retaliate.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric, due to long-term planning and government funding. The Chinese government has invested billions in developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EV production. This has allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production and build the world's largest public charging network. While some Western countries view this as unfair business practice, Chinese EV executives insist that all companies have access to the same resources.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is hoping to establish a clinic by the end of the year to offer ketamine as an alternative treatment for severe depression. This development follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is primarily known as a medical anesthetic and recreational drug, there is growing interest in its potential to treat severe depression. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

The Financial Times emphasizes the U.S. administration's position that it is not at war with Iran but with its nuclear program. The Guardian calls the attack "the most consequential intervention in a conflict in a generation," while the Daily Mail focuses on fears of an "Iran terror backlash" on Britain and other US allies. The Daily Express turns its attention to London, where it splashes on the prime minister's warning of "escalation" and reports the UK's terror threat has increased following the US intervention.</p>

          <p>It is often hard for people with overpayment problems to find lawyers to represent them because there is little financial incentive for attorneys to take on these cases. If you receive Social Security retirement benefits, one of the best ways to prevent overpayments is to check the earnings history Social Security has on record for you. If you're receiving Social Security disability benefits and decide to go back to work, you need to be extra careful. If you notice a mistake, whether it is with the earnings history Social Security has for you, or with the payments Social Security is sending, you must let the agency know about it as soon as possible.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Decision to Strike Iran Based on Intuition, Not New Intelligence</h2>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iran was based less on the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community and more on his own calculation of risk and reward. Despite the official assessment that Iran suspended its nuclear-weapons program in 2003, Trump believes Iran is actively pursuing everything it would need to build a weapon. The decision to use military force was a judgment call, and now, it’s his to own. The article suggests that this decision was a long time coming.</p>

          <h2>Republican Congresswoman's Ectopic Pregnancy Highlights Abortion Law Concerns</h2>

          <p>Florida Republican Congresswoman Kat Cammack blamed fearmongering on the left for hospital staff's reluctance to give her the drugs she needed to end an ectopic pregnancy that threatened her life. Cammack, who opposes abortion, said staff were worried about losing their licenses or going to jail if they did the procedure. Cammack looked up the state law on her phone to show staff and even attempted to contact the governor’s office. Hours later, doctors eventually agreed to give her the medication.</p>

          <p>Minjee Lee of Australia secured her third major title by winning the PGA Championship with a three-shot victory. She shot a two-over-par 74 on her final round in Texas, holding off the chasing pack in windy conditions. Lee was one of only three players to finish below par for the weekend, adding the PGA Championship win to major victories at the 2021 Evian Championship and 2022 Women's US Open. Her performance was particularly impressive given the difficult conditions and high scoring averages.</p>
