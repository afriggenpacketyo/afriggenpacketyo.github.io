          <p>Three Thai soldiers were injured when one stepped on a landmine near the border with Cambodia, escalating tensions just days after a ceasefire agreement. The Thai army condemned the incident as a violation of the Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines, and a significant obstacle to peace efforts. Cambodia's mine action authority denied laying new mines, highlighting its long-term efforts to clear unexploded ordnance from decades of conflict. The event follows a recent deadly five-day conflict between the two nations over disputed border temples.</p>

Speaking on "The Drew Barrymore Show," Bertinelli explained that her "Hot In Cleveland" co-star taught her to be thankful for all life experiences, including the difficult ones, as they provide opportunities for learning and growth. Bertinelli has been open about her recent personal struggles, including an "emotionally excruciating" period and her efforts to maintain sobriety.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested at least 365 people at a protest in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of participants display signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." The government banned the group following acts of serious criminal damage, making public support for it a criminal offense. Protesters argued the ban infringes on freedom of speech and the right to protest against government complicity in the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has unequivocally rejected any peace deal that involves ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia. His statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested a potential agreement with Vladimir Putin could include "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy emphasized that any negotiations conducted without Ukraine's participation would be "dead decisions" and that the nation's territorial integrity is non-negotiable. While some citizens in Kyiv expressed a desire for peace, the official stance remains firm against surrendering land to end the more than three-year-long war.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will hold a press conference on Monday with the stated goal of "essentially" stopping violent crime in Washington, D.C., which he described as one of the world's most dangerous cities. This follows a White House announcement to deploy federal law enforcement in the capital and threats from Trump to assume federal control of the city's police force. The move comes after a government staffer was assaulted, although official data shows that violent crime rates in D.C. have significantly decreased over the past year. The specific measures to be announced remain unclear.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel has created a significant rift within his own conservative CDU/CSU coalition. Critics, like CSU parliamentary leader Alexander Hoffmann, argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility toward Israel. However, the decision has also found support from other conservatives and coalition partners, including the Social Democrats, who believe that while solidarity with Israel is crucial, the actions of its government in Gaza must be addressed. The debate highlights deep divisions over Germany's foreign policy and its historical commitments.</p>

          <p>A shooting near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta resulted in the death of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and the suspected gunman, Patrick Joseph White. Officer Rose, a 33-year-old former Marine, was fatally wounded while responding to the incident, which saw gunfire hit multiple CDC buildings. Investigators are exploring the theory that the 30-year-old suspect was motivated by a belief that he was ill from a COVID-19 vaccine. No civilians were injured in the attack, and the CDC has asked employees to work remotely.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how partisan gerrymandering has reshaped American politics over the last 15 years, primarily benefiting the Republican party. It traces the origins of the modern problem to the 2010 "Redmap" project, a GOP strategy to win state legislatures and control the redistricting process after the census. This effort, combined with advanced mapping technology, allowed the party to create durable legislative majorities even in states where they received fewer overall votes. The article also notes how court decisions, particularly the Supreme Court's ruling in Rucho v. Common Cause, have limited legal challenges to the practice.</p>

The files, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, indicate that the leaks were due to the Ministry of Defence's failure to maintain an aging pipe network. One incident in 2019 resulted in an "unnecessary radioactive waste" release containing low levels of tritium.

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers spent $104 million to renovate the historic St. John's College site, which had been deteriorating for decades, preserving original elements like exposed brick and arched windows. The project, funded through a construction loan and private equity, includes a new wing and modern amenities. Of the 205 units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, with the building aiming to be a positive addition to the neighborhood's fabric.</p>

          <p>A proposal by several German cities to accept and provide medical care for seriously ill or traumatized children from the Gaza Strip has met with a hesitant response from the federal government. While cities like Hannover and Dusseldorf are willing to host the children, they require federal support for logistics and entry. However, conservative politicians in the ruling coalition have expressed concerns, fearing it could trigger a new wave of immigration and prioritizing on-the-ground aid instead. The debate highlights a conflict between humanitarian impulses and domestic political pressures regarding immigration.</p>

          <p>Analysts are expressing concern that Ukraine will be marginalized in the upcoming peace talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The meeting marks a departure from the previous "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine" policy, suggesting that a deal could be negotiated without Kyiv's direct involvement at the table. This places Ukraine in a difficult position, potentially facing pressure to accept terms brokered by the two leaders. The summit's format and potential outcomes reflect a significant shift in the diplomatic approach to resolving the ongoing war.</p>

Humanitarian agencies have condemned the plan, warning it will exacerbate the already catastrophic conditions, with a UN-backed report stating the "worst-case scenario of famine" is already occurring.
