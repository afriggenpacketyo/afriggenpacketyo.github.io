          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has pledged his country's "unconditional support" for Russia's actions in Ukraine during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. This declaration reinforces the deepening military and political ties between the two nations, which have been isolated by international sanctions. According to reports, North Korea has already supplied Russia with over 10 million artillery rounds and sent thousands of troops to the Kursk region in exchange for economic cooperation and military technology. The meeting signals a unified front against what both countries perceive as Western hostility and strategic threats.</p>

          <p>The third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden concluded a historic trilogy in women's boxing, with Taylor securing another victory. Unlike their previous explosive encounters, this match was a more tactical and controlled affair, with both fighters adjusting their strategies. This article reflects on the bout not as a spectacle of chaos but as a mark of progress, arguing that true equality in the sport includes the right for women to fight strategically and win without needing to be thrilling entertainers. It also explores the broader contradictions within women's boxing, from pay disparities to the athletes' right to choose risk for glory.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) and the UK's Health Secretary are scheduled to meet next week in an attempt to prevent a five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The planned industrial action, set to begin on July 25, stems from an ongoing dispute over pay, with doctors arguing that the government's 5.4% offer is insufficient to restore real-terms pay lost since 2008. While the government insists it cannot improve the salary offer, it has indicated a willingness to discuss improvements to working conditions. The talks come as recent polling suggests public support for the strikes has significantly decreased.</p>

The raid, which resulted in over 300 detentions, also led to protests and a federal judge issuing an order against agents using race or location to detain individuals. While officials defended the raid, the incident has highlighted the chaotic and sometimes tragic outcomes of these operations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Warns of Dire Strategic Consequences for the West if Ukraine Falls</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the potential collapse of Ukraine would represent a catastrophic strategic failure for the West, with severe negative consequences for European security and the international order. The author contends that after months of stalled progress and faltering support, particularly from the United States, the question of Ukraine's defeat is no longer hypothetical. The piece criticizes the West's complacency and calls for more decisive action, such as imposing air exclusion zones and tougher sanctions on Russia. It concludes that a Russian victory would usher in an era of wider conflict across Europe.</p>

          <p>The Chinese central government has become involved in the investigation into a lead poisoning case at a kindergarten in Gansu province, signaling the severity of the incident. The local kindergarten is suspected of using inedible, lead-based paint to color food served to children, leading to the detention of eight staff members, including the principal. The problem was reportedly discovered only after parents had their children tested in a different province. A high-level task force from the State Council will now work alongside provincial leaders and national health experts to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant rise in religious conservatism, driven by the growing popularity of Islamic-oriented political parties like the opposition Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition. This "green wave" of support, particularly among younger and more conservative Malay voters, is challenging Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's more moderate government. The trend is leading to pushes for stricter Islamic policies in states controlled by the opposition, creating tension in the multi-ethnic, multi-religious nation. Analysts suggest this shift is fueled by disillusionment with mainstream politics and could reshape Malaysia's social and political future.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase Dry-Season River Flow to India</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's dams on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River may not cause the droughts in India that have long been feared. The research, based on data from two existing dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, suggests the opposite effect is occurring. By regulating water release, the dams have significantly increased the river's flow during the dry season, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This finding could reframe the conversation around the controversial mega-dam project planned for Tibet, suggesting its impact on downstream water availability might be more complex than previously assumed.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, Florida lawmakers toured the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades, emerging with starkly different assessments. Democratic lawmakers described the conditions as "appalling," citing extreme heat, small food portions, and claims from detainees about inadequate access to water and medicine. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the facility stated they were satisfied with the conditions, with one senator calling the beds comfortable. The visit follows a lawsuit by Democrats to gain entry and ongoing protests over claims of inhumane treatment at the hastily constructed center.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1st. In response to what Mexico called an "unfair deal," both trading partners have threatened to implement proportionate countermeasures if the tariffs are enacted, while also expressing a desire to continue negotiations. President Trump has warned that any retaliation will be met with even higher import taxes. This move is part of a broader tariff strategy that has also targeted Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil, escalating global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
