          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting reveal a growing divergence among officials regarding future interest rate cuts. While most policymakers anticipate some reduction this year to counter potential economic weakening, opinions vary significantly on the timing and extent of these cuts. The debate reflects the challenge of balancing concerns over tariff-related inflation with signs of a slowing labor market and consumer spending. Officials ultimately agreed to maintain a cautious, data-dependent approach to monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hundreds of small earthquakes have been detected at Mount Rainier in Washington, marking the volcano's most significant seismic activity since 2009. The U.S. Geological Survey described the event as an "earthquake swarm" but assured the public there is no cause for immediate concern. The tremors are too small to be felt at the surface and are not expected to cause damage. Scientists believe the activity is likely caused by water movement within the Earth's crust rather than volcanic magma movement.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have sunk a second cargo vessel, the Greek-operated Eternity C, in the Red Sea within a week, resulting in at least three deaths and a large-scale search for over a dozen missing crew members. The attack highlights the persistent threat to international shipping in the vital maritime corridor. The Houthis claim their attacks support Palestinians and target ships linked to Israel, the US, or the UK. This recent escalation has prompted condemnation and calls for greater international efforts to protect freedom of navigation.</p>

          <p>Employees at the Environmental Protection Agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., have endured weeks of extreme indoor heat due to a failing air conditioning system, with temperatures reportedly rising above 80 degrees. Staffers have also faced malfunctioning elevators, raising safety concerns and fueling speculation among some that the poor conditions are a tactic to encourage resignations.

          <p>A 13-year-old boy has been arrested for allegedly starting a wildfire in Laguna Beach, California, after setting off fireworks. The Rancho fire forced the evacuation of about 100 homes in a coastal canyon before firefighters, with air support, were able to contain it to four acres without any structural damage. Authorities reportedly used video evidence to identify the juvenile suspect, who was later released to his parents and could face a felony charge for recklessly burning forest land.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has implemented new, more restrictive visa rules for Nigerian citizens applying for non-immigrant visitor visas. Under the new policy, Nigerians will be issued single-entry visas with a three-month validity, a significant rollback from the previous five-year, multiple-entry visas. The move comes as the Trump administration continues its broader review of immigration and travel policies, which has included bans and considerations for new restrictions on citizens from numerous countries, including seven in Africa.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging its policies that allow transgender athletes to compete based on their gender identity violate the civil rights of female students. The lawsuit claims these rules deny equal athletic opportunities to girls and create a hostile educational environment, in violation of federal law. This legal action represents a significant escalation in the Trump administration's engagement with culture war issues, specifically targeting state-level policies related to transgender rights in school sports.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are planning for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump later this month, where he is expected to open a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort. While the visit is not yet officially confirmed, authorities are preparing for what would be a significant and costly security operation. The president's last visit in 2018 drew large protests, and critics are already raising concerns about the potential policing costs and using the visit to address contentious issues like U.S. trade tariffs.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism after reports that he ensured a Republican spending bill cut funding for weather forecasting research just before deadly floods struck his home state of Texas. The Guardian reports that Cruz inserted language into a recent bill that eliminated a $150 million fund for improving weather observation and forecasting systems. This action, combined with a vacation to Greece during the disaster's aftermath, has drawn accusations that the senator has weakened systems designed to protect the public from increasingly severe weather events.</p>

This resurgence of a disease declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 is linked to lagging childhood vaccination rates and has resulted in at least three deaths, highlighting a significant public health challenge.</p>

          <p>President Trump's invitation to the leaders of five African nations—Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal—signals a strategic focus on trade, critical minerals, and security over traditional aid. A BBC analysis suggests the summit reflects the administration's "trade, not aid" policy, with the US likely seeking deals on resources and cooperation on migration and counter-terrorism. This approach is seen as part of a broader effort to counter the influence of China and Russia on the continent, shifting US-Africa relations toward a more transactional, "America First" model.</p>

          <p>Russian forces are conducting a major summer offensive in Ukraine, concentrating attacks on three main fronts and claiming their biggest territorial gains of the year. The primary goals appear to be cutting off Ukrainian supply routes in the east and creating a buffer zone in the northern border regions like Sumy. Despite these advances, the Russian push has been slow and costly, meeting stiff Ukrainian resistance. Military observers believe the operations are also designed to stretch Ukraine's defenses thin along the extensive front line.</p>
