          <p>Typhoon Kajiki has brought significant devastation to Vietnam, making landfall with powerful winds up to 130 km/h and causing widespread flooding, especially in the capital, Hanoi. The severe storm has tragically resulted in at least three fatalities and ten injuries, displacing many and leaving over 1.6 million people without electricity. Thousands of homes have been damaged, alongside extensive agricultural land, and airports in affected provinces were closed. Rescue teams are actively working to clear blocked roads and assist with evacuations. Authorities warn that continued heavy rainfall poses a high risk of further flash floods and landslides, indicating a prolonged recovery effort for the affected areas and neighboring countries like Laos and Thailand also experiencing heavy rainfall.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets experienced a sharp decline, largely influenced by a 2% drop in France's CAC 40 index as political uncertainty looms. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's proposed budget cuts of €44 billion, aimed at reducing the national deficit, have led to a potential no-confidence vote next month, as opposition parties refuse to back his plans. This domestic political risk is compounded by global investor concerns following US President Trump's announcement to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, intensifying his efforts to pressure the central bank on interest rates. The broader market sentiment reflects an unwind of previous momentum trades in European assets, highlighting significant economic and political risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The second series of "With Love, Meghan" has launched on Netflix, providing an aspirational and upbeat portrayal of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex's, life in Montecito, filmed near her home. The article highlights her sharing cooking, gardening, and hosting tips with celebrity friends, alongside personal revelations like her daily hot breakfasts for her family and Prince Harry being the first to say "I love you" during their early relationship. While the Duke and their children do not appear on camera, the series deliberately omits any discussion of the Royal Family or past royal life, instead revealing Meghan's surprising fondness for Magic Radio from the UK.</p>

          <p>Australia has taken strong diplomatic action by expelling Iran's ambassador and three other embassy staff, citing intelligence that links the Iranian government to antisemitic attacks on Australian soil. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) found Iran coordinated incidents, including an arson attack on a Sydney cafe and a Melbourne synagogue. In response, Australia has also recalled its diplomats from Tehran, suspended embassy operations, and plans to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. This unprecedented move since World War Two underscores Australia's condemnation of foreign interference and aggression.</p>

This dramatic move escalates Trump's persistent criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over interest rate policy, raising significant questions about the central bank's independence and its future composition ahead of critical monetary policy decisions.

          <p>China is accelerating the expansion of its national carbon market, with plans to incorporate major industrial sectors by 2027, significantly ahead of its original schedule. This initiative, guided by top policymakers, will introduce tougher absolute limits on emissions, moving beyond the current carbon intensity-based caps. The strategic expansion aims to revitalize the carbon market and demonstrates China's strengthened commitment to achieving its climate goals, as it remains the world's largest carbon polluter. Steel, aluminum, and cement industries are slated for inclusion this year, though with initially less stringent regulations, signaling a more aggressive emissions pathway for the nation.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has branded illegal migration a "scourge" of historic proportions, unveiling his party's comprehensive plan to address the issue, particularly small boat crossings. The proposed measures include immediate detention and deportation for illegal arrivals, along with drastic legal reforms such as exiting the European Court of Human Rights and repealing the Human Rights Act to facilitate easier removals. Farage advocates for a legal mandate on the Home Secretary to deport illegal migrants and to deny them asylum claims. However, opposition parties have criticized the plan as lacking practical detail and relying on unrealistic international agreements, raising questions about its implementability.</p>

          <p>Food price inflation in the UK has surged to an 18-month high, reaching 4.2% in August, primarily propelled by substantial cost increases for chocolate, butter, and eggs. The British Retail Consortium's latest shop price monitor indicates that overall retail prices are now rising at their fastest pace since March of the previous year. Poor cocoa harvests, linked to climate change and crop disease, are specifically driving up chocolate prices, while staples like butter and eggs face high demand and increased labor costs. This trend contributes to a broader increase in UK inflation, with food and non-alcoholic beverages experiencing a 4.9% rise year-on-year, impacting household budgets as consumers return from summer.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly achieved a significant breakthrough in "invisibility technology" designed for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, which are typically vulnerable due to their strong radar emissions. The new method, based on frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, aims to make AEW&C signals highly resistant to interception and geolocation. By subtly varying the frequency of each antenna, the signal appears chaotic and its directional origin becomes obscured, effectively rendering the aircraft a "phantom" to adversaries. This innovation marks a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the operational secrecy and survivability of these critical command nodes in modern warfare scenarios.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor shares experienced a notable decline, falling over 6% in Tokyo trading, after Mercedes-Benz announced its intention to divest its 3.8% holding in the Japanese automaker. Mercedes-Benz clarified that its pension trust would sell the stake, valued at roughly $346 million, as part of a portfolio cleanup, considering Nissan holdings no longer strategically significant. This divestment exacerbates existing pressures on Nissan's stock, which has been struggling with U.S. tariffs, declining sales, and the competitive shift towards electric vehicles, particularly from Chinese rivals. The company is currently undergoing a major restructuring, including significant job cuts and plant closures, to address its financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A district court judge has declared Utah's current congressional map unlawful, ordering the Republican-controlled legislature to redraw the state's boundaries for the 2026 midterm elections. The 2021 map was found to be in violation of voters' rights because it strategically divided Salt Lake County, a significant Democratic stronghold, among all four congressional districts, leading to wide Republican victories. The ruling highlighted that the legislature circumvented a commission established by voters to ensure non-partisan redistricting. Although new maps are required swiftly, Republican lawmakers have indicated they will appeal, potentially delaying the implementation of new boundaries until 2028 and creating political uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House.</p>
