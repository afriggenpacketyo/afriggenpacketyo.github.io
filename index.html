          <p>A recent Russian missile attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least nine fatalities and numerous injuries, prompting Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to cut short his South Africa trip and return home. The attack occurred amidst stalled peace negotiations, with President Trump criticizing Zelenskyy for not ceding Crimea to Russia, escalating tensions further. Rescue operations are underway in Kyiv, and Ukrainian officials have condemned the attack as a clear indication that Russia is not interested in peace, but in continuing the war, as the international community expresses concern over the escalating conflict.

          <p>Data shows that racial disparities in youth incarceration in the United States are the widest they've been in decades, with Black and American Indian children significantly more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers. Experts attribute this disparity to factors such as heavily policed neighborhoods and unequal access to diversion programs. The consequences of youth incarceration can be long-lasting, impacting educational attainment and increasing the likelihood of future involvement in the adult criminal justice system.
