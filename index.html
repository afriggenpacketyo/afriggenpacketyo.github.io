          <p>Max Verstappen secured victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris finished second after the team ordered his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to let him pass. The decision came after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a wheel gun fault, dropped him behind Piastri, sparking debate about fairness in racing and its impact on the drivers' championship standings. Piastri's lead over Norris in the championship has now been reduced to 31 points.</p>

In an interview, she detailed her efforts to get clarity from the administration regarding plans for immigration enforcement and the use of military facilities, noting a lack of cooperation from the Department of Homeland Security. Duckworth also criticized a recent U.S. military strike off the coast of Venezuela as an illegal move that sets a dangerous precedent for American civilians in international waters.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the war on Ukraine, involving over 800 drones and missiles, which struck targets across the country. In Kyiv, the main government cabinet building was damaged for the first time, and at least two civilians were killed in the capital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a "deliberate crime" and called for increased international military aid and sanctions against Russia. The attack prompted NATO fighter jets in Poland to scramble as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption for imports under $800 has raised concerns about its impact on small businesses. However, this analysis argues that the panic is misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. While the tariffs will likely lead to price increases, the author contends that the overall economy can absorb these costs as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong. The article suggests businesses are adapting by diversifying suppliers and offering financing options to customers. (not investment advice)</p>

Organizers from Defend Our Juries disputed the police's account, stating the protest was peaceful and that the ban is an unenforceable waste of resources.

A linguistic analysis shows his use of this specific hyperbole has increased significantly this year, reflecting his black-and-white worldview where his successes are historic and the nation's problems are unprecedented crises.

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as the head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, Belichick addressed recent reports by confirming he has banned New England Patriots scouts from attending his team's practices. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, their staff is not welcome at his, highlighting the ongoing animosity since his departure from the NFL team he coached for nearly 25 years.</p>

          <p>London's public transport system is experiencing significant disruption as London Underground staff, represented by the RMT union, have begun a five-day strike over pay and working conditions. The industrial action will result in little to no service on most Tube lines through Thursday, with other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground expected to be much busier. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the union's demand for a reduced 32-hour work week, calling it unaffordable and impractical.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's ongoing investment in coal-fired power plants is not a reversal of its climate policy, but rather a strategic move to support its massive expansion of renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation growing at a record pace, the grid faces challenges from intermittency and "curtailment," where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. Coal plants are being used as a reliable backup or "shock absorber" to ensure grid stability during peak demand and when renewables are unavailable, allowing for a more confident and rapid transition to clean energy.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for its decision to ask broadcast partners not to show any crowd disruptions or negative reactions to President Donald Trump during the US Open men's final. This opinion article calls the move a "cowardly and hypocritical" act of censorship that sacrifices the event's authenticity to shield a politician from public disapproval. The author argues that crowd reactions are a form of democratic expression and that the USTA's policy is a capitulation that undermines the tournament's character and its history of breaking barriers.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, co-founder of the online marketplace Vinted, created the platform out of a personal need to sell clothes she could no longer fit in her closet after moving to a new apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly launched a simple website in Lithuania that allowed people to buy and sell secondhand clothing. The idea rapidly gained popularity, expanded internationally, and overcame early business challenges to become Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup, now valued at over a billion dollars with millions of users in the UK alone.</p>

          <p>A new study of sauropod fossils from Brazil reveals that these giant, long-necked dinosaurs suffered from osteomyelitis, a destructive bone infection caused by pathogens like bacteria or fungi. Researchers analyzed the 80-million-year-old skeletons of six dinosaurs from the same site and found lesions indicative of the disease, which likely progressed rapidly and may have contributed to their deaths. The findings suggest that the swampy, riverine environment these dinosaurs inhabited was a breeding ground for pathogens that posed a significant threat even to some of the largest creatures on Earth.</p>

This move comes as the Trump administration considers using private contractors in a post-war capacity, raising concerns given Prince's history of profiting from conflicts and his controversial reputation within the defense industry.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, following the implementation of a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious texts. His specific endorsement of Christian prayer has drawn criticism for violating the separation of church and state and for its hypocrisy, given his past opposition to Muslim students praying in school. Critics argue that Paxton is promoting a Christian nationalist agenda that seeks to impose a specific version of Christianity on a diverse student population, disrespecting other faiths and constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>William Pulte, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), is facing scrutiny for his unusual and direct involvement in a criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. Former officials and housing finance experts describe the director's personal intervention as "bizarre," noting that such investigations are typically handled independently by the agency's inspector general to avoid political influence. Critics suggest the move is politically motivated, as President Trump has used the allegations as a basis to try and fire Cook from the Federal Reserve board.</p>

A screwworm outbreak could devastate the American cattle industry, potentially causing billions in economic losses. The USDA is reviving control measures, including building new facilities to produce sterile flies to combat the parasite's spread.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Angela Rayner as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has voiced concerns about the "balance" of the reshuffled Labour cabinet. Rayner's departure, prompted by underpayment of stamp duty, has triggered a contest for the separate role of deputy party leader. Burnham suggested this is an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and expressed a preference for a new deputy leader from the north of England to counter a "London centricity" in the government.</p>
