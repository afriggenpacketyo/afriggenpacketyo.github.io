          <h2>Trump Signs Executive Order to Lower US Drug Prices by Matching Foreign Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 11:32:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug prices by tying them to lower prices in other developed countries, a policy dubbed the "most favored nation" approach. The order targets countries with more power to negotiate drug prices and directs agencies to crack down on policies that suppress drug prices abroad. The administration expects drugmakers to reciprocate these actions by providing discounts across the board, and the order also seeks to cut out middlemen by facilitating direct sales of drugs to American citizens at the "most favored nation" price. The policy is a blow to the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it could hurt profits and research, and it's unclear how effective the policy will be at lowering costs for patients.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily slash tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, leading to a surge in the U.S. stock market. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will lower tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. This agreement marks a temporary rollback of tariffs initiated earlier and is seen as a positive step towards a wider trade deal, though base-level tariffs remain substantially higher than before the trade disputes began. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed over 1,000 points following the announcement, reflecting investor optimism about the de-escalation of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's willingness to accept a lavish jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar has sparked criticism over the legalities of what would mark the largest foreign gift ever received by the U.S. government. Trump is preparing to accept a Boeing 747-8 which he will then use as Air Force One, four sources familiar with the plan told NBC News. The ownership of the gift is expected to be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation once Trump ends his second term, two of the sources said. Trump defended the potential acceptance, citing delays from Boeing and framing it as a contribution to the Defense Department.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra is planning to announce his candidacy for governor, setting the stage for a potentially competitive primary in the GOP. The state will have an open race for governor next year due to incumbent Kim Reynolds' decision not to seek another term. Feenstra's entry could lead to a high-profile Republican primary, potentially including Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, who is seen as President Trump's preferred choice. On the Democratic side, Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand has also entered the race, marking the first major moves towards the office on both sides. The Iowa race could be one of the most closely watched gubernatorial races in the state and nationally next year.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (P.K.K.), a Kurdish militia group, announced that it would lay down its arms and disband, potentially reshaping Turkish politics and influencing Kurdish militias in neighboring countries. The decision follows calls from the group's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged disarmament in favor of political means to achieve Kurdish rights. The P.K.K., which has waged a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state for four decades, stated that it has completed its mission and that the Kurdish issue can now be solved through democratic politics. This move could end a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and could potentially boost President Erdogan's support among Kurds.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields increased on Monday following the U.S. and China's agreement to reduce tariffs on each other's goods, signaling investor confidence that a recession may be avoided. The 10-year Treasury yield rose by 5.8 basis points to 4.431%, while the 2-year Treasury yield jumped more than 10 basis points to 3.983%. This agreement is viewed as a positive development, with economists previously expressing concerns that high tariffs could push the U.S. and the globe into a recession. The odds of a near-term rate cut from the Federal Reserve have also decreased, as there may be less need for intervention to boost the labor market if the U.S. avoids a recession.</p>

Officials also noted a significant decrease in the number of illegal aliens temporarily released into the U.S. during April.

          <p>President Donald Trump said he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook after the U.S. and China agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days, a move that has boosted Apple's stock. Trump indicated that Cook plans to increase Apple's investments in the United States, including building more plants. The easing of trade tensions is expected to benefit Apple, which conducts the majority of its device production in China and counts the region as its third-largest market. Apple previously announced plans to spend $500 billion to expand its operations in the U.S., including assembling AI servers in Houston.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that China has "agreed to open" to U.S. businesses and suspend trade barriers following a temporary agreement to slash tariffs. Trump stated that this development was "maybe the most important thing" to come out of trade talks in Geneva, though he noted that the commitments have not yet been finalized. The U.S. and China have agreed to pause most tariffs and other trade barriers for 90 days, with the U.S. reducing tariffs to 30% and China lowering them to 10%.

          <p>President Trump's upcoming trip to the Middle East is primarily focused on securing business deals, including those related to planes, nuclear power, and arms, rather than advancing strategic foreign policy goals.

Qatar is expected to donate a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane for Trump's use, raising ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest and violations of the Emoluments Clause.

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs for 90 days, signaling success in trade negotiations. The two sides committed to a 90-day suspension of most levies imposed since early April, reducing tariffs by 115 percentage points. The temporary reductions will effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China will reduce its levies on American imports to 10%.

The move coincides with the release of $3.3 billion in state-controlled housing funds for local officials to implement the ordinance. While the ordinance does not specify criminal penalties, it makes homeless encampments on public property a crime, and cities will decide how tough the penalties should be.</p>

          <p>Germany's aging population is putting the country's pension system under strain. The new Labor Minister Bärbel Bas has ruffled feathers with a proposal for how to fix it. The pension system in Germany, established in 1889, is based on a public retirement insurance scheme in which the pensions of current retirees are paid using insurance contributions from the currently employed — a system known as the "intergenerational contract." But the outlook is grim: At the beginning of the 1960s, there were still six actively insured workers for every old-age pensioner. Now that ratio is 2:1, and sinking further.</p>
