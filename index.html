          <p>Former Idaho State Trooper Dan Howard called 911 claiming his wife, Kendy Howard, had shot herself in the bathtub. However, investigators grew suspicious due to several unusual factors at the scene, including broken glass, strategically placed wet towels, and the warm water in the tub. One of the most telling clues was a load of laundry mid-cycle in the dryer, which was started about a minute before the 911 call, leading detectives to theorize Howard was attempting to cover up the crime. Dan Howard was later arrested and went on trial for the murder of his wife.</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was found guilty of second-degree murder and domestic battery in the death of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy was found dead in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to her head, initially reported as a suicide. However, investigators became suspicious due to inconsistencies at the scene, including a running dryer and a packed duffel bag. The prosecution argued that Dan Howard used a carotid restraint hold, a maneuver he learned in law enforcement training, to kill his wife after she told him she wanted a divorce. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
