            <p>The Trump administration is considering forming a working group to address potential supply chain disruptions resulting from steep tariffs on Chinese goods. The group would include key officials such as Vice President J.D. Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This move comes as the White House and Beijing have imposed retaliatory tariffs, raising concerns about the availability of medicines, semiconductors, and critical minerals. The administration has been working on supply chain issues in anticipation of the tariffs, although a deal has been discussed.</p>

            <p>The article explores the use of dark humor as a response to political repression and uncertainty, drawing parallels to historical examples like sarcastic jokes under authoritarian regimes. It discusses how humor can serve as a form of dissent and solidarity in the face of overwhelming malice. Freud's theories on humor as a defense mechanism are examined, as well as the use of sardonic jokes in Communist East Germany and the censorship of Winnie-the-Pooh in China. The piece also touches on the use of humor by authoritarian leaders and the importance of anti-totalitarian laughter.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has replaced the acting IRS commissioner, Gary Shapley, just days after appointing him, with Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender. Shapley, an IRS whistleblower who accused the Justice Department of granting special treatment to Hunter Biden, will remain as a senior advisor at the Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Faulkender is the right person to restore trust in the IRS. After Gary and Joseph Ziegler complete their ongoing year-long investigation, I intend to appoint them both to senior roles at either the IRS or United States Treasury that will ensure the results of their investigation translate into meaningful policy changes.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status due to concerns about antisemitism on campus, leading to a historical comparison with Bob Jones University, which lost its tax-exempt status for discriminatory policies. Experts note that revoking Harvard's tax exemption would have significant financial implications for the university and its donors. The IRS has long exempted universities from taxes because of their " educational purposes " and commitment to public service. Legal scholars believe Harvard would have a strong defense if the Trump administration's threats become material.</p>
