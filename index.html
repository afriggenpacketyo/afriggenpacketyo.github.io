          <p>The article discusses how Northern California's commercial crab season is threatened by migrating humpback whales. Fishermen are facing restrictions due to whale entanglements in traditional crab cage ropes. One fisherman, Brand Little, uses a high-tech pop-up system developed by the U.S. military to avoid whale entanglements, allowing him to continue fishing. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season to protect whales, but Little's innovative technology allows him to fish without harming them.</p>

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has voiced skepticism about the recent Blue Origin space flight featuring an all-female crew, including Jeff Bezos' fianc√©e, Lauren Sanchez, and Katy Perry. O'Neal suggests the flight may have involved green screen technology, citing concerns about the celebrities' hair not moving in zero gravity and discrepancies in the landing video. He believes Bezos would not risk sending Sanchez into space, fueling his doubts about the mission's authenticity. Despite Perry's comments about the experience being "second to being a mom," O'Neal remains unconvinced, implying the video appeared to be staged at Universal Studios.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is not adequately prepared for the upcoming hurricane season. The acting head of FEMA, David Richardson, acknowledged the agency is only "80 or 85% there" in terms of preparedness, despite President Trump's "bold vision" for the agency. Staffing limitations, hiring issues, and a lack of coordination with states are cited as contributing factors. Richardson emphasized the intent to safeguard Americans and strengthen states' capabilities, but morale within FEMA is reportedly low due to proposed agency downsizing.</p>

          <p>New York University has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who condemned the Gaza war in his commencement speech, accusing the U.S. of supporting "genocide." The university stated that Rozos abused his privilege to express personal political views and is pursuing disciplinary action. Rozos, who identifies as an "actor, artist, and gay Black trans man," criticized the U.S.'s political and military support for what he described as a genocide. NYU is one of several universities under investigation for antisemitism related to campus incidents since the start of the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 600 employees at Voice of America (VOA), a federally funded news network, which amounts to over a third of the staff. The layoffs, targeting contractors including journalists, suggest a continued effort to dismantle the broadcaster despite a court ruling to maintain robust programming. The federal building housing VOA has also been put up for sale.

Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses, which lived around 17,000 years ago, were slightly larger than modern wild horses, and genetic exchanges occurred between the continents in both directions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement, made at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, lacked specifics, causing confusion within the Treasury Department. Discussions are underway to determine the speed and extent of rolling back the decades-old sanctions. Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges, and the decision comes amid efforts by Turkey and Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with the new Syrian government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This GDP data was poorer than economists' expectations of a 0.1% contraction, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies significantly impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had recently cautioned that the country's economy would likely moderate due to global trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Small businesses are struggling with financial instability as a result of President Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Chinese goods. Business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, faced a 145% tariff, then a reduction to 30%, causing him to increase prices and rush orders for the holiday season. Many U.S. businesses are in a dilemma, weighing the cost of shipping at the current rate against the hope of further tariff reductions. The situation has led to increased demand for foreign trade zone facilities and bonded warehouses to defer tariff payments.</p>

The government quietly corrected its impact assessment on assisted dying, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year.

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation in Los Angeles following accusations of sexual assault. Four anonymous housekeepers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual battery, false imprisonment, negligence, and gender violence. Robinson has denied the allegations, with his lawyer claiming the accusers are after his money. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed the investigation, stating it is in the "early stages." The women are seeking at least $50 million in damages and a jury trial, alleging incidents dating back to 2006.</p>
