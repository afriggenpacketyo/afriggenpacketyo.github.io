          <p>A 54-year-old Tennessee man, Kevin Wade O’Neal, faces 11 counts of attempted first-degree murder after allegedly trying to detonate improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during his arrest. Authorities were at his home to serve warrants for threats against public officials. While apprehending O'Neal, officers noticed a smoldering device, prompting an evacuation. A subsequent search by a bomb squad uncovered 14 IEDs in the residence, leading to additional charges for possessing prohibited weapons and explosive components.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly denounced a potential deal between Senate Republicans and Democrats aimed at moving presidential nominees forward in exchange for unfreezing certain withheld funds. On social media, Trump labeled the prospective agreement as "embarrassing to the Republican Party" and urged GOP members to reject the offer from Senator Schumer. He advised them to instead focus on highlighting what he terms the Democrats' negative influence and the Republican party's accomplishments for the country. The specific details of the proposed deal remain unclear.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report indicated a significant slowdown in hiring, with only 73,000 jobs added and a large downward revision for May and June. Trump claimed the numbers were inaccurate and politically manipulated, a move that drew criticism from economists and some Republican lawmakers who warned it could undermine the credibility of federal economic data. The administration defended the firing, citing concerns over major revisions, and named a deputy commissioner to serve in an acting capacity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, upholding a lower court's finding that agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling affirms that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion of illegal status before detaining someone, rejecting the Trump administration's request to suspend the order. The case stems from controversial raids that sparked protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The administration criticized the ruling, stating that it undermines law enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump, for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This federal law restricts the political activities of federal employees. The investigation follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions, particularly the timing of his investigations before the 2024 election, were politically motivated to harm Trump's campaign. Smith, who resigned in January, had previously maintained his investigations were not driven by politics.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reportedly launched an internal investigation following allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, "Strictly Come Dancing." The claims were first reported by The Sun on Sunday, which stated the alleged drug use was an open secret on set and that the BBC hired a law firm to lead the probe. The allegations were reportedly made in a legal submission from a former celebrity contestant. This follows a year of controversies for the show, which has recently implemented new welfare measures for its cast and crew.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams in Chile have recovered the remains of one of the five miners who were trapped following a partial collapse at the El Teniente copper mine. The collapse occurred after a magnitude 4.2 seismic event, which also resulted in one other fatality outside the mine. Over 100 rescuers have been working at the site, located south of Santiago, to find the miners who were trapped as deep as 1,200 meters underground. Chilean President Gabriel Boric met with the families, assuring them that all resources are being deployed in the ongoing rescue effort.</p>

Witnessing his stepfather pass away at 54, before he could enjoy retirement, solidified Hill's resolve to follow a different path.

A sale at this price would represent a book value loss for United, as Hojlund is only two years into his five-year contract.</p>

The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but perished days before arriving in the UK. While wartime rumors suggested it died from shell-shock due to a German U-boat encounter, newly analyzed records tell a different story. Archival logs of water and air temperatures show the ship crossed the equator in conditions far too hot for the creature, suggesting it effectively died from heatstroke.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the stories of those who survived attacks by David Berkowitz, the "Son of Sam" serial killer who terrorized New York City in 1976-77. It details the harrowing experiences of Robert Violante, who was blinded in the attack that killed his first date, Stacy Moskowitz, and Carl Denaro, who was shot in the head months earlier. Both men faced immense physical and emotional challenges in the aftermath. Their stories provide a powerful portrait of courage and resilience in the face of a senseless crime spree that left six people dead and seven others wounded.</p>

          <p>Authorities are warning about a flood of dangerous counterfeit Labubu dolls entering the market, capitalizing on a viral TikTok trend. Trading Standards officers in the UK have seized thousands of fake dolls that pose a serious choking hazard, with small parts that easily detach. These fakes are often sold at a fraction of the price of the authentic, highly sought-after toys from parent company Pop Mart. The Intellectual Property Office warns that counterfeit toys are often made with unsafe materials, including toxic chemicals, as criminals rush to profit from popular trends with no regard for safety.</p>

The demonstrations are part of a series of recent protests targeting these facilities. The government has stated it is reducing the number of hotels used for this purpose and plans to end their use entirely by 2029 to cut costs and "restore order" to the asylum system.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin has publicly lambasted his players following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening league match. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and criticized their lack of bravery and aggression compared to their opponents.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from the injured list, striking out eight batters over five innings in his first start since early in the season. However, his performance was marred by two home runs from Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. Despite Snell giving up three runs, his outing was seen as promising, showcasing the command and swing-and-miss stuff the Dodgers need for their late-season push. The Dodgers' offense was quiet, ultimately losing the game 4-0.</p>
