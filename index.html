          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year, aiming to democratize its ownership. He stated this move would allow the public to have a stake in the paper, ensuring it truly represents the voices of the people, regardless of political affiliation. While specifics on the investment arrangement, such as an initial public offering, were not provided, this initiative comes as the news industry faces significant financial challenges. Soon-Shiong, a billionaire known for his pharmaceutical and biotech ventures, seeks to secure the long-term future and broad appeal of this influential publication through wider public involvement.</p>

          <p>After 38 months of legal resistance and profound grief, the Uvalde CISD school board has unanimously voted to release the investigation records pertaining to the devastating Robb Elementary mass shooting. This pivotal decision follows a recent appeals court ruling favoring news outlets seeking transparency regarding the widely criticized law enforcement response to the 2022 massacre, which claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers. Families of the victims, who have endured unbearable pain and unanswered questions, hailed the vote as a long-overdue step toward healing and accountability. Board members collectively apologized for their prior inaction, signaling a commitment to rebuilding trust through greater transparency and compassion.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 01:26:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 5.2 million aboveground swimming pools sold across the U.S. and Canada by Bestway, Intex Recreation, and Polygroup are subject to a major recall following reports of nine child drowning deaths. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada issued notices, explaining that compression straps on the outside of these pools, sold since 2002, can create a dangerous foothold for small children, allowing unsupervised access to the water. These tragic deaths, involving children aged 22 months to 3 years, occurred between 2007 and 2022. Consumers are strongly urged to immediately contact the manufacturers for a free repair kit, or to ensure no small children can access the pool without constant supervision, potentially draining it until the repair is completed.</p>

          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles, often considered the "holy grail" of sustainable driving, is gaining renewed momentum with major automakers and cell producers setting aggressive commercial production timelines. These batteries promise significantly higher energy density, faster charging times, and enhanced safety compared to traditional lithium-ion cells. While some companies are initially focusing on semi-solid batteries as a bridge technology, mass production of full solid-state solutions is anticipated before the end of the decade. This progress could significantly transform the EV market, despite lingering challenges like high production costs and continuous improvements in existing lithium-ion technologies.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's increasing reliance on tariffs is being examined as a new form of sanctions, blurring the traditional lines between import taxes and punitive measures. Unlike sanctions, tariffs offer direct, unilateral control via executive orders and generate revenue for the US Treasury, aligning with Trump's "America First" agenda. Critics argue this approach, while flexible for Trump's shifting goals, creates global trade uncertainty and risks de-globalization. The article notes Trump's use of tariffs to pressure countries on non-trade issues, such as immigration or political alliances, raising concerns about their destabilizing effects on international relations and potential for armed conflict.

Mayor Daniel Lurie supports the policy, citing the need to clear sidewalks and address trash buildup, while critics argue it's cruel given the city's severe housing affordability crisis. An accompanying permit program will exempt existing RV residents if they work with homeless outreach staff to find indoor housing, with the city offering to buy RVs. However, concerns remain about insufficient housing units and the immediate impact on vulnerable populations, including immigrant families, who rely on RVs as their only affordable option.</p>

Schnabl argues this perpetuates a narrow, victim-centric view of Balkan literature, overlooking diverse narratives about universal human experiences such as love, loss, and the mundane realities of life. She advocates for publishers to embrace a broader range of authentic voices that challenge established perceptions and expand global literary understanding beyond simplistic regional tropes.</p>

Mosquera brutally killed both men in their London flat, then dismembered their bodies before attempting to transport them in suitcases to Bristol for disposal. The court proceedings revealed that Albert had paid Mosquera for sexual videos, and Mosquera claimed he was raped "every day" by Albert, although his primary motive appeared to be financial. This shocking double homicide deeply impacted the community, and Mosquera was found guilty of the double murders, awaiting sentencing in October.</p>

          <p>Dozens of peacocks, beloved residents of the historic Ryde Hotel in California, have been reported stolen, prompting a felony investigation by the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office. A witness saw two men forcing a peacock into a cage and loading it into a pickup truck, and a subsequent headcount revealed only four of the estimated 40 birds remained. Hotel staff are deeply distressed, fearing the peacocks may be used for cockfights, the black market exotic animal trade, or even meat, which would be a horrific fate.

          <p>Newly released National Archives documents reveal that Cherie Blair, wife of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, received substantial discounts on designer clothing while in Downing Street, sparking concern among officials. Between July 2001 and December 2002, Mrs. Blair paid £31,000 for clothes valued at over £75,000, with these "wholesale" discounts negotiated by her personal shopper. Downing Street officials worried about public perception and the implications under a new ministerial code, advising the Blairs to repay thousands, though it's unclear if this occurred. The papers highlight internal discussions about how to frame the discounts and ensure no preferential treatment had been given, reflecting the ethical scrutiny faced by public figures.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has surged by £221 over the past three years, reaching £1,283 this spring, according to property portal Zoopla. This significant increase, comparable to rises in mortgage repayments, is attributed to high tenant demand and insufficient rental property supply. While the rate of rent increases has slowed, particularly in cities, it continues to rise sharply in more affordable areas adjacent to large cities. The article highlights the severe financial strain on renters, with some having to decline jobs or rely on parental support, and many young people losing hope of homeownership due to rising costs and deposit demands.

          <p>The preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has fueled intense speculation due to a crucial detail: both fuel-control switches abruptly moved to "cut-off" seconds after takeoff. The cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking why the "cut-off" occurred, with the other denying responsibility, leaving key questions unanswered about who initiated the action. While the switches were reset, the plane crashed before full power recovery. Speculative media reports have focused on the senior pilot, but investigators urge restraint, emphasizing the ongoing probe and the need for the full transcript and detailed data analysis to determine the root causes.

Despite the Justice Department recommending no prison time, District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings imposed a 33-month sentence, arguing that not doing so would minimize the jury's verdict and the severity of his actions. Taylor's death, alongside other killings of Black individuals, sparked widespread racial justice protests, making this sentencing a significant moment for accountability.</p>

Examples from Canada and China indicate significant movement in removing such barriers, while the European Union's progress is less clear, potentially prioritizing defense spending over internal commerce and trade.
