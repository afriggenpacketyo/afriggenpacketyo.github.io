          <p>A military helicopter crash in Ghana's Ashanti region tragically killed the country's defense and environment ministers, along with six other individuals. Chief of Staff Julius Debrah described the incident as a "national tragedy," confirming the deaths of Edward Omane Boamah and Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed. The aircraft had gone "off the radar" after taking off from Accra, en route to Obuasi for a national event. Authorities have not yet confirmed the cause of the crash, prompting flags to fly at half-mast.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has called on the FTC and DOJ to scrutinize and potentially block Dick's Sporting Goods' proposed $2.4 billion acquisition of Foot Locker. Warren argues the merger could create a duopoly in athletic footwear, leading to job losses, higher prices for consumers, and reduced competition. She highlighted concerns about increased economic hardship for parents facing rising back-to-school shopping costs. Despite some analysts suggesting the merger is unlikely to raise significant antitrust flags due to market share, Warren emphasizes the need for careful review.</p>

          <p>Following the controversial 2018 birth of gene-edited babies, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and pronatalists are reigniting efforts to advance human gene-editing technology for reproduction. A new company, Manhattan Project, aims to transparently explore preventing genetic diseases, starting with animal studies. While some scientists welcome private funding for underfunded research, bioethicists express significant worry, fearing a "dangerous moment" that could lead to a new era of market-based eugenics. Critics emphasize that just because technology allows something, it doesn't mean it should be pursued, especially with inheritable changes.</p>

          <p>Fashion accessories retailer Claire's has filed for bankruptcy in the US for the second time, citing declining sales due to online competition and changing consumer trends. The company, known for its jewelry and ear-piercing services, is struggling with debt obligations and macroeconomic factors, including new tariffs impacting its global supply chain. While discussions are ongoing with vendors and landlords, North American stores are expected to remain open during the process. This highlights the ongoing shift away from brick-and-mortar retail and the rise of ultra-cheap online rivals.</p>

He also praised Amazon's strategic move to integrate OpenAI's "open weight" models into its AWS cloud service, countering narratives of lagging in generative AI. Cramer emphasized focusing on undervalued stocks rather than chasing "go-go stocks" and reflected on the portfolio's recent underperformance as a chance for long-term gains.

          <p>Germany is seeking to expand its list of "safe countries of origin" to fast-track asylum procedures, aiming to curb illegal migration. This comes after a European Court of Justice ruling that allows such designations but requires judicial scrutiny and protection for entire populations, including minorities. The German government plans to determine safe countries by decree, bypassing parliamentary oversight, to speed up deportations. However, opposition parties and human rights advocates criticize these plans, especially concerning countries like Tunisia and Algeria where same-sex sexual relations are punishable, raising questions about ensuring safety for all.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total to 50%, due to India's continued purchase of Russian oil. The White House stated this action undermines US efforts to counter Russia's aggression in Ukraine and its ability to fund its war machine. India's foreign ministry called the tariff "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," asserting its right to safeguard national interests, especially as it was previously encouraged to import Russian oil for global market stability. This move highlights Trump's willingness to penalize even allies over the Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>The relationship between India and the US, once strong, has deteriorated significantly under President Trump's second term, marked by escalating tariffs and critical rhetoric. Trump imposed a total of 50% tariffs on Indian goods, citing India's purchase of Russian oil, and has made controversial comments about India's economy and its dispute with Pakistan. This has created a "Catch-22" for Delhi, balancing domestic pressure for a firm response with the desire for a trade deal. Analysts view Trump's actions as a tough negotiation tactic, but the strain highlights the challenges to the long-standing strategic partnership.</p>

          <p>This article critiques "therapy culture" and modern parenting advice that often instills excessive guilt in mothers, suggesting their every misstep could psychologically scar their children. The author, a psychologist, argues that this promise of control is an illusion based on shaky science, diverting attention from systemic issues like lack of structural support for mothers. Historically, psychology has often blamed mothers for children's problems, and while the language has changed, the underlying implication of maternal responsibility for a child's entire psychological future persists. The article advocates for a shift away from obsessive self-scrutiny towards addressing external factors impacting parenting.</p>

This action highlights ongoing tensions between state abortion bans and medical standards, with some patients reportedly dying due to care delays.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of residents in Dresden, Germany, were evacuated as experts successfully defused a 250-kg British World War II bomb found during demolition work. The unexploded ordnance necessitated a wide exclusion zone, affecting famous landmarks like the Frauenkirche. Such finds are common in Germany, regularly leading to large-scale evacuations. This incident marks the second mass evacuation in Dresden this year due to a WWII bomb, underscoring the enduring legacy of the conflict and the ongoing efforts to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Elaine Castillo's novel "Moderation," which explores how technology can enable emotional avoidance and dissociation in modern life. The author reflects on personal experiences of grief being swallowed by phone use, highlighting the addictive nature of screens. The novel centers on Girlie Delmundo, a content moderator exposed to horrific material, who uses wit and dissociation to cope. "Moderation" is praised for mirroring the human experience of hiding from feelings through digital means, suggesting that while technology offers distraction, it cannot ultimately save individuals from their deeper emotions.</p>

          <p>Hiroshima commemorated the 80th anniversary of the US atomic bombing, with aging survivors expressing profound frustration over the increasing global acceptance of nuclear weapons as deterrence. Mayor Kazumi Matsui warned against policies that disregard historical tragedies, especially with ongoing conflicts and major powers possessing vast nuclear arsenals. Survivors, whose numbers are rapidly declining, emphasize that "nuclear weapons and humanity cannot co-exist" and urge younger generations to carry forward their message. Despite calls for Japan to sign the nuclear weapons ban treaty, the government maintains reliance on the US nuclear umbrella.</p>

          <p>President Trump is portraying foreign investment pledges secured through trade deals as "gifts" or "signing bonuses," significantly overstating their nature and enforceability. He claims billions in investments from Japan and the EU, but trade partners describe these commitments differently, often as aspirational or conditional, with limited government authority to enforce private sector actions. This highlights a fundamental disconnect in how Trump and other nations view these agreements, with the White House warning of retaliation if commitments are not met. The article suggests Trump's rhetoric may exaggerate the true scope and binding nature of these pledges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US home prices are showing modest declines in certain regions, particularly the South and West, according to a new Realtor.com report. This trend is driven by rising inventory in these areas, where construction boomed during the pandemic, easing seller competition. Conversely, the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience "sticky high" prices and tight inventory due to stricter zoning laws. While national median home prices are still growing, the rate of increase is slowing, suggesting a gradual rebalancing of the housing market, though regional experiences vary significantly.

          <p>New research published in the Journal of the American Heart Association indicates a link between excessive screen time and increased cardiometabolic disease risks in children and teens. The study found that each additional hour of daily screen time raised the risk for conditions like high blood pressure and cholesterol in 10- and 18-year-olds. Researchers also noted that less sleep and later bedtimes amplified this relationship, suggesting screen time negatively impacts health by displacing sleep. The findings underscore the importance of limiting discretionary screen time for protecting long-term heart and metabolic health in youth.</p>

The auction, set for September 10, requires bidders to have a net worth of at least $500 million and a $10 million deposit.
