        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a 7% decrease in energy prices starting in July, marking the first drop in a year. This change will result in an average annual bill decrease of Â£129 for households using typical amounts of gas and electricity. While charities welcome this reduction, they emphasize that many individuals are still struggling with energy costs, with collective customer debt to suppliers reaching approximately Â£4 billion. The price cap affects 22 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales, but does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to consider a face-to-face meeting in June during the Group of Seven summit in Canada, with hopes for productive ministerial-level tariff negotiations beforehand. During a 45-minute phone call, both leaders emphasized the need for win-win bilateral relations through these negotiations, though specific details were not discussed. This conversation occurred before another round of tariff talks in Washington, where Japan aims to persuade the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policies, including a 25% import duty on cars, due to concerns about the impact on Japan's export-driven economy.</p>

          <p>Actor Kelsey Grammer has voiced his growing alarm over the manipulation potential of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly concerning deepfakes and the blurring lines between reality and fabrication. While acknowledging AI's benefits in fields like medicine, Grammer is wary of AI's capacity to fabricate identities and the implications of artificial general intelligence (AGI). He remains confident that AI cannot replicate the spontaneity of human beings, making real human interactions more compelling. Grammer emphasizes the importance of integrity and good manners in the context of AI development and usage.</p>

          <p>North Korea has launched an investigation into an accident that occurred during the launch of its second naval destroyer, with leader Kim Jong Un denouncing the incident as criminal negligence. During the launch, sections of the bottom of the newly built 5,000-ton naval destroyer were crushed due to a transport cradle detaching early. While initial reports suggested serious damage, later inspections revealed that the hull was scratched and seawater flowed into the stern, but the damage was deemed not serious. The article notes that South Korea believes the ship is similarly equipped to the Choe Hyon, potentially developed with Russian assistance.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for high-paying customers of his personal cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, promising to promote the crypto industry from the White House. The event drew protests condemning it as corruption, with attendees explicitly stating their intent to influence U.S. financial regulations. Trump criticized the Biden administration's actions against crypto companies and pledged to change the approach. The dinner was organized by Trump's business partners to promote sales of his memecoin, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the use of the presidency for personal enrichment.
