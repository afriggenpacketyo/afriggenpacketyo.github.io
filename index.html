          <p>Mortgage demand saw a modest 0.6% increase last week, following a significant 58% surge in refinance applications the prior week. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 6.34%, its lowest since September 2024, though rates were volatile after a Federal Reserve cut. While refinance activity is up 42% year-over-year, purchase applications remained largely flat. Experts note continued strength in homebuyer demand despite seasonal trends, with government applications driving the refinance boost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker has revealed he regrets winning Wimbledon at just 17 years old, citing the immense pressure it placed on his career and personal life. Despite achieving further Grand Slam titles, his early success was overshadowed by financial difficulties and a turbulent private life, including a jail sentence in 2023. Becker believes that winning at such a young age prevented him from maturing normally and set an impossibly high benchmark for his subsequent endeavors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected former FBI agent Peter Strzok's lawsuit, which alleged his termination violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights. Strzok was fired for sending anti-Trump text messages while leading the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The court ruled that the FBI's interest in avoiding the appearance of bias and protecting its operations outweighed Strzok's right to express political opinions on an FBI phone. The due process claim was also dismissed.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lauded Donald Trump's "productive meeting" and subsequent shift in rhetoric regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, where Trump suggested Ukraine could reclaim all its territory. This marks a significant departure from Trump's previous skepticism about Kyiv's battlefield ambitions. Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for Trump's "strong cooperation" and belief that the US President is now "well informed" about the conflict, raising cautious optimism in Kyiv despite Russian objections to Trump's assessment.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp in Texas, plans to partially reopen next summer, a year after catastrophic floods claimed the lives of 27 campers and counselors. The owners announced that the undamaged sections of the camp will resume operations, while the areas along the Guadalupe River that were destroyed will remain closed. This decision has drawn criticism from some families regarding the camp's safety measures, even after new state laws were enacted to improve camp safety.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes the European Union's increasingly confrontational stance towards China, likening it to "tilting at windmills" and causing self-inflicted economic harm. The article argues that the EU's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), despite China's concessions, undermines its stated goal of reducing its trade deficit. This approach also hinders the EU's energy transition by obstructing the adoption of cost-effective Chinese clean energy technologies.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's ban on race-based affirmative action, the Trump administration is now contending that even race-neutral admissions policies are illegal if intended to foster racial diversity. This interpretation has already led the College Board to discontinue its "Landscape" tool, which provided socioeconomic data. Despite judicial resistance to this broad interpretation, the administration's willingness to wield its power may compel universities to comply, potentially signaling the end of race-neutral diversity efforts.</p>
