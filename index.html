          <p>Chinese authorities have pledged to tackle the growing problem of oversupply and intense competition within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. During a meeting with industry leaders, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology emphasized the need to curb disorderly low-price competition and promote the phasing out of outdated production capacity. This move follows President Xi Jinping's call to address excess industrial capacity across the economy. The government aims to guide companies toward improving product quality and ensuring the sector's healthy, sustainable development amid global market expansion.</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi warns that the Iranian government is intensifying its repression of citizens, using the recent conflict with Israel as a pretext. From her home in Tehran, she stated that the regime is leveraging the situation to deflect from its own failures by increasing executions and arrests to spread fear. Mohammadi expressed concern that the war has made the work of human rights activists more difficult and dangerous. She is calling for renewed international focus on Iran's human rights abuses, particularly the harsh conditions political prisoners face after being transferred from the damaged Evin Prison.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group seized power in 2021. The announcement followed a meeting in Kabul between Afghanistan's Foreign Minister and the Russian ambassador. In a statement, Russia's foreign ministry indicated the move would foster bilateral cooperation in areas like tackling terrorism and drug trafficking. This decision, which comes after Moscow removed the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations, has been criticized by some as prioritizing strategic interests over human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>A targeted drive-by shooting outside a Chicago restaurant and lounge has resulted in four deaths and at least fourteen injuries. The incident occurred as patrons were leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police believe the attack was deliberate, with some victims being part of the rapper's inner circle, and are investigating the possibility of gang involvement. Authorities have shut down the venue and are preparing for potential retaliatory violence as the search for the three suspected shooters continues.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a state with an early and pivotal presidential primary, fueling speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. His tour will cover eight of the state's most economically challenged counties, a move the state's Democratic Party chair framed as showing rural voters they are not forgotten. While a political advisor denied the trip is about a presidential run, Newsom's visit to a key primary state continues his pattern of engaging with voters in traditionally Republican strongholds across the South.</p>

Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and other ranking Democrats, the brief argues that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish a federal agency. The lawsuit was filed after the administration slashed nearly half the agency's staff and paused over $6 billion in congressionally approved education programs. The lawmakers contend that only Congress can create, restructure, or abolish federal agencies through legislation.</p>

The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee hike, framing it as an "America first" policy to fund park improvements. Additionally, the order calls for U.S. residents to receive preferential treatment in park lotteries and permitting.

Advocates for military families report that the deployment is straining service members, who are unprepared for such missions and are being pitted against American citizens.

According to the National Parks Conservation Association, the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration took office.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a public "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's direction under the Trump administration. The employees' letter argued the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment. In response, the EPA accused the signers of unlawfully undermining the administration's agenda, stating it has a zero-tolerance policy for such actions. This move comes as the agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, has moved to roll back numerous environmental regulations and cut funding for climate science.</p>

          <p>Two new private universities in China, founded by prominent business tycoons, are set to welcome their first undergraduate students this year. Fuyao University of Science and Technology, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, founded by semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, represent a new wave of philanthropy focused on education. These research-focused institutions are part of a broader national strategy to achieve "scientific self-reliance." Observers predict these new universities will become highly selective and may soon compete with top public institutions for talented students.</p>

          <p>A New York jury has delivered a mixed verdict in the trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, finding him guilty on two lesser charges but acquitting him of the most serious counts of racketeering and sex trafficking. Combs was convicted of transporting two former girlfriends, including the singer Cassie, to participate in sex acts and prostitution, for which he faces up to 10 years in prison for each charge. While the outcome was seen as a partial victory for the music mogul, his reputation has been severely damaged by months of sordid testimony. The verdict has elicited strong reactions from both his supporters and detractors.</p>

Boelter faces federal charges of murder, stalking, and weapons violations, for which he could face the death penalty, in addition to state charges.

          <p>A cross-party committee of UK members of parliament has found that the Home Office does not know if foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee reported that the department has failed to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020. The report criticized the Home Office for showing "little curiosity" about the program's operation and for being slow to address evidence of worker exploitation. Over 1.18 million people have applied for the visa since its launch.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is expected to be out for approximately six weeks after being placed on the injured list with a bone bruise in his left knee. The injury occurred during a game when a runner's helmet collided with his knee on an attempted steal. While Muncy initially feared a more severe injury, an MRI revealed no structural damage, which he described as the "best-case scenario." His absence creates a significant gap in the Dodgers' lineup, as he was a team leader in multiple offensive categories during the month of June.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature tax and spending bill is set to become law, enacting a long-held conservative vision for reshaping the federal government's role. The legislation extends tax cuts from his first term while fundamentally altering major social safety net programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). By imposing stricter work requirements and cutting funding, the bill is projected to cause millions to lose benefits. While Republicans argue this will reduce waste, critics warn of widespread economic effects on low-income families, local economies, and the national deficit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The economic impact of the Trump administration's aggressive tariff strategy remains uncertain as a key deadline for negotiations approaches. While the stock market has largely recovered from an initial drop, shares of tariff-vulnerable companies in retail and auto sectors are still down. U.S. goods imports have increased year-over-year, but a continuation of high tariffs could trigger a recession, according to some analysts. With consumer spending showing signs of slowing, the long-term effects on prices and economic growth are still unclear, creating a 'wait-and-see' mode for many businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
