          <p>Microsoft's shares experienced a significant increase of over 6% after the company released its quarterly earnings report, which exceeded expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The company's revenue grew by 13% year over year, with Azure revenue increasing by 33%, driven in part by AI-related growth. While the earnings report reflects past performance, investors are keenly awaiting insights from the upcoming earnings call regarding the potential impact of President Trump's recently announced tariffs on future results. Microsoft also announced an adjustment to its relationship with OpenAI during the quarter, indicating a right of first refusal for new computing capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwegian Cruise Line's shares experienced a decline of over 7% following its first-quarter earnings report, which indicated potential softness in bookings due to consumer skittishness regarding far-from-home travel. CEO Harry Sommer noted some "choppiness" in cruises booked to Europe from the United States in the third quarter. The company modified its guidance on net yield growth but maintained its guidance on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share, projecting cost savings through more favorable foreign currency rates and lower fuel prices. Sommer also reiterated the cruise industry's view that travelers increasingly look to cruises during economic turmoil because of the value of those vacations over land-based holidays.</p>

          <p>President Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs on China may result in fewer goods available to consumers at higher prices, suggesting children might have fewer toys. He insisted that China is bearing the brunt of the tariffs due to decreased factory business. Trump also downplayed concerns about the U.S. economy, attributing a recent decline in domestic gross product to his predecessor. He stated that tariffs will soon take effect and companies are beginning to move into the USA, leading to an economic boom and urged patience.</p>

          <p>GE HealthCare reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, but the company lowered its annual forecast due to the impact of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff policy. The company's revenue increased by 3% year over year, and net income rose significantly compared to the same period last year. However, GE HealthCare expects adjusted earnings for the full year to decline by 9% to 13% from its previous guidance, with the range including an estimated 85 cents per share impact from tariffs. CEO Peter Arduini stated that the company is actively driving mitigation actions in response to the global trade environment.</p>

The company indicated that it is balancing investment with realized revenue growth due to headwinds impacting advertising demand. Snap's finance chief, Derek Andersen, noted that some advertisers are already feeling the effects of changes to the de minimis exemption, which allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Oklahoma's plan to use public funds for a Catholic charter school, raising questions about the separation of church and state. The justices appeared divided, with conservative appointees seemingly supportive and liberal justices wary. The case could have broad implications for charter school laws across the country, potentially leading to the expansion of religious charter schools. Arguments centered on whether the school would be controlled by the state and whether excluding it would constitute discrimination against religion. The court has previously ruled that states must allow religious schools in programs that help parents pay for private education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer flexibility and attractive interest rates, but borrowers need to understand their structure, particularly the transition after 10 years. Most HELOCs have a 10-year draw period followed by a repayment period, during which access to funds ends and monthly payments increase, often substantially. Borrowers can prepare by making principal payments early, calculating future payments, and considering refinancing options. HELOCs are a powerful borrowing tool, but it's important to plan proactively to avoid financial strain when the draw period ends.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed inclined to support the establishment of the nation's first public religious charter school in Oklahoma. The case tests the role of religion in government and schools, with the court weighing whether denying the school violates religious freedom. Proponents argue the school is not a government entity, while opponents warn it could upend charter school systems nationwide. The ruling could have significant implications for the separation of church and state and the future of school choice programs.</p>
