          <p>Chinese-owned Volvo Cars plans to cut approximately 3,000 jobs, primarily impacting office-based positions in Sweden. The layoffs are part of a cost-cutting initiative due to challenges in the global motor industry, including U.S. tariffs and slower sales. CEO HÃ¥kan Samuelsson cited the "challenging period" as the reason for the layoffs. The company had previously announced an 18 billion Swedish kronor "action plan" to restructure the business. In 2021, Volvo aimed to go all-electric by 2030, but scaled back this ambition due to various issues.</p>
