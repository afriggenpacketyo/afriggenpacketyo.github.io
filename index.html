          <p>China has stated that it is evaluating the possibility of engaging in trade negotiations with the United States, responding to recent overtures from senior U.S. officials. However, China insists that the U.S. must demonstrate sincerity by rectifying what it views as erroneous practices, including the removal of all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. A spokesperson for the commerce ministry emphasized that failure to do so would undermine mutual trust and compromise any potential dialogue. China's offshore yuan strengthened following the statement, indicating a positive market reaction to the possibility of renewed trade discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule tied to the Clean Air Act, which aimed to limit seven of the most hazardous air pollutants emitted by heavy industry. This action marks the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act in its 55-year history. The rule required industrial facilities to maintain strict pollution controls, but Republicans argued it disincentivized companies from deploying new pollution-reducing technologies. Environmental groups have criticized the move, warning of increased risks to public health, particularly for children, due to the potential release of toxic air pollutants.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to intensify tariff talks, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June. Following meetings between Japanese and U.S. officials in Washington, both countries plan to hold intense ministerial discussions starting in mid-May, preceded by working-level talks. Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that they managed to deepen discussions on nontariff barriers and economic security cooperation. Japan hopes the U.S. will remove auto tariffs and is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as National Security Advisor, nominating him as U.N. ambassador. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz, continuing as America's top diplomat. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Some suggest the Trump administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing the president to get rid of him completely without having to fire him.</p>
