        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several UK councils are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, even after a Court of Appeal ruling overturned an injunction against the practice in Epping. The ruling was seen as a potential precedent, but councils in West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne, supported by political figures, argue the hotels are unsuitable and strain local services. The original case cited planning law breaches and public safety risks, and despite the legal setback, some councils are considering an appeal to the Supreme Court, signaling ongoing local resistance to the central government's asylum accommodation policy.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian aerial attack on Ukraine resulted in at least one death and 24 injuries, including three children, primarily in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian air defense intercepted most of the 45 missiles and 537 drones, but strikes still damaged over 40 houses and critical infrastructure, causing power outages. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for tougher international sanctions against Moscow, while Ukrainian forces reported successful counter-strikes on two Russian oil refineries in the Krasnodar and Samara regions.</p>

Cody and Liam Townend discovered their baby, Macie-Mae, on a sofa at Amie Upton's home, ten days after last seeing her, feeling their child was "robbed of her dignity." This case is part of a wider investigation into Upton's service, Florrie's Army, which has been banned from Leeds hospital mortuaries. The incident has intensified calls from the family and their MP for stricter government regulation of the funeral industry to prevent similar occurrences.</p>

          <p>Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson is set to move to German club Bayern Munich on a season-long loan, a deal that includes a significant purchase option. The agreement involves an initial £13 million loan fee, with Bayern having the option to make the transfer permanent for £56.2 million. Jackson, 24, has already agreed to a pre-contract with the German champions and is traveling to complete the move. The Senegalese striker's opportunities at Chelsea have been limited following the arrival of new signings, prompting his departure to seek more consistent playing time.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has dealt a significant blow to former President Donald Trump's trade policies by upholding a ruling that he cannot unilaterally alter the nation's tariff schedules. The decision challenges the president's expansive use of executive power to refashion American trade law, a cornerstone of his economic agenda. This legal setback affirms the judgment of a lower three-judge panel and sets the stage for a potential showdown at the Supreme Court. The ruling focuses on the constitutional limits of presidential authority in matters of international commerce and taxation.</p>

          <p>A worldwide movement to protect children online, exemplified by new legislation like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, is fueling the development of AI-driven safety technologies. These regulations compel tech companies to shield minors from harmful content, leading to the adoption of advanced age-verification systems from firms like Yoti, which uses facial analysis to estimate age. Beyond software, new hardware like HMD Global's child-safe smartphone uses AI to block inappropriate content at the device level. This regulatory pressure is creating a new market for safety tech, though it also raises privacy concerns among critics.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's recent struggles, highlighted by a cup loss to a lower-league team, stem from systemic issues with manager Ruben Amorim's tactical approach. The article analyzes how his rigid 5-2-3 positional system, which relies on creating numerical overloads through specific passing patterns, is often neutralized by opponents using man-to-man marking. Because the system discourages individual dribbling and roaming, the team lacks a Plan B when their primary routines are disrupted. Defensively, United's two-person midfield is frequently outnumbered, allowing opponents to control games, suggesting Amorim may need to adapt his methods.</p>

The government's goal is to enable young Ukrainians to pursue education and work abroad, hoping they will gain valuable experience to eventually aid in the nation's post-war development. This policy addresses fears that the previous restrictions were causing a permanent "brain drain," as young men who left before turning 18 were hesitant to return.

          <p>As Russia continues its large-scale drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, European Union foreign ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss bolstering support for Kyiv. Top diplomats called for tougher sanctions on Moscow and explored using frozen Russian assets for Ukrainian reparations and defense. The meeting occurred as Ukrainian authorities reported another deadly overnight attack that killed at least one person and injured over two dozen more. In a related development, North Korean state media reported that leader Kim Jong Un met with the families of North Korean troops killed while fighting for Russia.</p>

          <p>China has strongly criticized Japan's decision to deploy the U.S.-made Typhon intermediate-range missile system during upcoming joint military exercises. The Chinese foreign ministry stated its firm opposition, arguing the deployment undermines regional security interests and urged both the U.S. and Japan to cancel the plan. According to Japanese media, the Typhon system will be temporarily positioned at a U.S. base in Japan for the duration of the drills. Analysts interpret the move as a strategic deterrent aimed at Beijing, particularly concerning a potential conflict over Taiwan, signaling escalating military tensions in the region.</p>
