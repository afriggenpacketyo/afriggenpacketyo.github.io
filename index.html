          <p>A jury at the Old Bailey has found three men guilty of an aggravated arson attack on a London warehouse that shipped aid and satellite equipment to Ukraine. The act was orchestrated on behalf of the Russian mercenary organization, the Wagner Group, which the UK has proscribed as a terrorist group. The attack caused approximately £1 million in damages and was part of a series of planned 'missions' against Ukrainian-linked and Russian dissident targets in the UK.</p>
