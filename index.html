          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI for allegedly obstructing an immigration arrest operation, according to a now-deleted social media post by FBI Director Kash Patel. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from Eduardo Flores Ruiz, an undocumented immigrant, allowing him to initially evade arrest. Flores Ruiz was later apprehended, but Patel stated Dugan's actions created increased danger to the public. The complaint notes that ICE planned to arrest Flores Ruiz at the courthouse, but he fled after apparently learning of their intent, leading to a foot chase and eventual capture.</p>

          <p>The US has reportedly proposed that Ukraine accept Russian control of Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement to end the conflict, a move that would represent a major shift in US foreign policy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Kyiv will not legally recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, as it would violate the Ukrainian constitution. Experts warn that recognizing the annexation would undermine international law, alienate allies, and provoke internal political fallout. The US Vice President JD Vance declared that both Ukraine and Russia would have to give up territories.</p>

India accuses Pakistan of backing militant groups, while Pakistan asserts that the region should have become part of Pakistan during the partition.

          <p>With student loan collections resuming, the U.S. government has the power to seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits to recover defaulted debts. Social Security recipients may see up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced, and wages can be garnished up to 15% without a court order. Borrowers can avoid collection activity by getting out of default through income-driven repayment plans or loan rehabilitation. Experts advise requesting a retroactive forbearance to cover missed payments and a temporary forbearance until enrollment in an income-driven plan is complete.</p>

          <p>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has exhausted its food stocks in Gaza after a seven-week Israeli blockade, leaving people with limited options for survival. The agency delivered its last food supplies to hot meals kitchens, which are expected to run out of food in the coming days. Severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies, and fuel are also impacting hospitals and water distribution. The WFP urges all parties to prioritize the needs of civilians and allow aid to enter Gaza immediately, emphasizing that more than 116,000 tonnes of food assistance are ready to be delivered.</p>
