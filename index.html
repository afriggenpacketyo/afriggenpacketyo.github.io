          <p>Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis reports that cryptocurrency theft has reached $2.17 billion in the first half of 2025, already surpassing the total for all of 2024. While a single major hack on the Bybit exchange accounts for a large portion, there is a disturbing trend of increased physical violence against crypto holders. Criminals are resorting to kidnapping and coercion to gain access to personal digital wallets, a shift potentially driven by enhanced security measures at larger crypto trading platforms. This rise in violent crime highlights new risks for individuals in the crypto space, especially those who publicly display their wealth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled $4 billion in federal funds allocated for California's high-speed rail project, citing the authority's failure to meet its commitments and make progress. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy labeled the project a "boondoggle," while President Trump criticized the effort as overpriced and undelivered. California Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed to fight the "illegal action," setting up a political and legal battle between the state and federal governments. The project, which originally aimed to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, was later scaled back to a shorter route between Merced and Bakersfield.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is purchasing shares in Cisco Systems, viewing the company as a key player in the artificial intelligence era. The firm highlights Cisco's essential role in providing the networking equipment for AI data centers and its successful push into the cloud computing market, having already secured $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders. The company's transition to a subscription-based software model is also seen as a positive, improving revenue predictability and profit margins. With an undemanding valuation and a solid dividend yield, the club sees potential for the stock to appreciate further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent changes under the Trump administration, including the repeal of the SAVE plan, are raising concerns among consumer advocates about the affordability of federal student loan payments. The administration's "big beautiful bill" phases out several income-driven repayment options, replacing them with a new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) that features significantly higher monthly payments for many borrowers. With the interest-free pause for former SAVE participants ending, millions may face unexpectedly large bills. Advocates warn that the reduction in affordable plans could increase the risk of loan defaults for many Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration appears to be deprioritizing the prosecution of white-collar crimes, a shift from its tough-on-crime rhetoric typically aimed at immigrants and political opponents. Since Trump's second term began, the DOJ has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and federal prosecutions for financial crimes have declined. Memos from the department suggest a focus on avoiding "overreach that punishes risk-taking," and critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren argue this turns a blind eye to corporate malfeasance. This approach, combined with a series of pardons for financial fraudsters, signals a more lenient stance on corporate and financial misconduct.</p>

The study attributes these potential deaths to the loss of health insurance coverage and the elimination of enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing their own plans.

          <p>Katherine Maher, the CEO of National Public Radio, has warned that the proposed $1.1 billion in federal funding cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting could jeopardize public safety. She emphasized that public media stations are a critical part of the emergency alert and response systems in nearly half of U.S. states, especially in rural areas. The cuts, part of a broader rescissions package pushed by the White House, could force many smaller stations to reduce staff, cut programming, or even shut down entirely. Maher argued that losing these stations would diminish the ability to disseminate life-saving information.</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated boxing rematch between Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn, scheduled for September 20, is now in jeopardy. Promoter Eddie Hearn stated that Eubank Jr. has not agreed to the fight and "does not want it," making the proposed date improbable. The first fight, which Eubank Jr. won, was a major event, renewing a rivalry started by their fathers decades ago. With influential Saudi backer Turki Alalshikh reportedly no longer involved in negotiations, the window for the lucrative rematch appears to be closing, with Hearn speculating that Eubank Jr. may not fight again.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new trade deals with Vietnam and Indonesia include steep tariffs on "transshipped" goods, a move aimed at preventing China from evading U.S. tariffs by re-routing products through neighboring countries. This policy has created significant economic uncertainty in Southeast Asia, as the region's manufacturing is heavily reliant on Chinese components and inputs. The key concern is how broadly the U.S. will define transshipment; a strict definition could subject a vast range of exports to punitive tariffs, potentially disrupting supply chains for both Asian manufacturers and U.S. companies.

Simultaneously, Volvo is phasing out some sedans and station wagons in the U.S. market due to waning demand and the high cost of tariffs.

The article also highlights a grim consequence: states with abortion bans have seen a significant rise in maternal mortality rates, with Black women disproportionately affected. Meanwhile, some prosecutors are using laws like "desecration of human remains" to criminalize women who miscarry, creating a climate of fear.</p>

Pelosi described Trump as "ruthless" and argued that this fear, combined with the potential for political retribution, is why Republicans have largely abandoned their constitutional duty to act as a check on the executive branch. This dynamic is a key reason for the party's loyalty to the former president.</p>
