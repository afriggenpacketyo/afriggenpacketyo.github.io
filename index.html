          <p>Homeowner's insurance premiums are rising in all 50 U.S. states, with a projected national average increase of around 8% this year, driven by the growing frequency of severe natural disasters.

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will lay off about 9,000 employees, which constitutes less than 4% of its global workforce. The cuts are part of a broader organizational restructuring that typically occurs at the beginning of the company's fiscal year. This move follows several previous rounds of layoffs and is aimed at streamlining operations and reducing layers of management to increase agility. The decision comes despite Microsoft reporting strong financial results, with nearly $26 billion in net income in the previous quarter.</p>

This shift in policy indicates a broader application of immigration enforcement actions, affecting a wider range of individuals living in the U.S. without authorization.

          <p>Athletic apparel company Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco, accusing the discount retailer of trade dress infringement for selling what it calls "knockoff" designs. Lululemon claims that certain Costco products, including hoodies and pants, are so similar to its own that they confuse consumers and violate its intellectual property. The lawsuit points to the popularity of these items as "dupes" on social media and seeks to halt their sale and recover damages for lost profits.</p>

          <p>Recent youth-led protests in Kenya are drawing strong parallels to the historic "Saba Saba" (July 7) demonstrations of the 1990s, which pushed the country toward multi-party democracy. Both movements share core demands for economic justice, accountability, and an end to state corruption and violence. While today's protests are largely leaderless and organized via social media, they face similar government responses, including the use of force and legislative attempts to restrict public demonstrations, highlighting enduring political tensions in the nation.</p>

The investigation found that moisture in a transformer, which was detected in 2018, was the likely cause of the fire, but the issue was never fixed despite internal guidance classifying it as an "imminent fault." The report also noted a communication failure, as National Grid was unaware that a disruption at that specific substation would force the entire airport to close.</p>
