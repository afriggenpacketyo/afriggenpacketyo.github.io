          <p>PepsiCo has announced plans to reduce artificial ingredients in its food products by the end of 2025, responding to consumer demand and new guidelines from the Health and Human Services Secretary. CEO Ramon Laguarta stated that over 60% of their portfolio already lacks artificial colors, with brands like Lay's and Tostitos transitioning by the end of the year. The HHS is establishing national standards for the food industry to transition from petrochemical-based dyes to natural alternatives.

          <p>A Senate report alleges that Elon Musk leveraged his influence within the Trump administration to potentially avoid over $2 billion in legal liabilities for his companies. The report claims that Musk's companies faced numerous regulatory actions totaling billions in potential liability on the day of Trump's inauguration. Senator Richard Blumenthal has sent letters to Musk-led companies requesting information on federal investigations they faced prior to Trump's inauguration and the steps taken to separate Musk's government work from those probes.

Chief economist Torsten Slok presented a timeline indicating that U.S. consumers could experience trade-related shortages as early as next month. The presentation also noted a sharp decline in new business orders, earnings outlooks, and capital spending plans. While the administration has paused some tariffs, levies on goods from China are now subject to a 145% rate, contributing to the pessimistic outlook.(not investment advice)</p>
