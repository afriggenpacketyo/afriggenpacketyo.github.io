          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 06:20:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has proposed extending the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method considered destructive to the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. The ban would expand from 18,000 km2 to 48,000 km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas, aiming to safeguard rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. This proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. Separately, President Macron of France called for a moratorium on deep sea mining at the UN Ocean Conference, expressing concerns about the potential disruption to deep seabed biodiversity and ecosystems. The UK has yet to ratify the High Seas Treaty, and the push for ratification is underway. </p>

          <p>A study by Vote Forward reveals that personal letters sent to millions of potential voters had no effect on turnout in the 2024 election, prompting calls for Democrats to reassess their organizing tactics. The study highlights the risk of ineffective or even counterproductive field operations, especially in presidential elections where voters are already saturated with information. Progressive groups are urged to be more transparent about campaign failures and to invest in deeper engagement with voters beyond election cycles. The study also suggests that novelty is key in political campaigns, as traditional methods become less effective over time. </p>

The bill would significantly increase the US deficit and disproportionately benefit the wealthy, leading to criticism from some Republican senators and Elon Musk. The bill's tax cuts are a major driver of its cost, while proposed cuts to public benefits and increases in health insurance premiums could leave millions uninsured. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts under the Trump administration could devastate NASA's science programs, potentially undermining long-term goals like returning to the moon and landing on Mars. The cuts would reduce NASA's budget to levels not seen since the early days of Project Mercury, canceling numerous space exploration projects and hindering international scientific collaborations. This approach reflects a jingoistic view of American science and a lack of awareness of the long-term investments required for space exploration. The cuts also jeopardize the nurturing of new generations of scientists and the data needed for future missions. </p>
