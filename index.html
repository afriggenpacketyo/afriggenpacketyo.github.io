          <p>A new political battle is emerging over congressional redistricting, as Texas Republicans initiate mid-decade map redraws to gain an electoral advantage for the 2026 midterms. This aggressive and abnormal gerrymandering is compelling national and state-level Democrats to consider their own similar efforts, despite internal opposition and significant legal and political obstacles. While some Democrats lack the political will to bend norms, the Republican strategy is forcing them to confront the reality that traditional fairness might not be enough to maintain political standing. This escalating gamesmanship raises concerns about the future integrity of elections and public trust in governmental processes.</p>

          <h2>Hasbro Exceeds Q2 Expectations Driven by Strong Gaming Performance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hasbro reported stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings, primarily driven by robust performance in its digital gaming division, including popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!. This success helped to counteract persistent weaknesses in its traditional toy business, which faced pressure from tariffs and retailer order timing. Despite reporting a net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment and tariff impacts, the company's CEO outlined strategies like cost reductions and supply chain diversification to manage these headwinds. Hasbro subsequently raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in continued revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford concluded with India at 264-4, significantly impacted by an injury to batsman Rishabh Pant, who retired hurt after being struck on the foot. England's captain Ben Stokes secured two crucial wickets, despite winning his fourth consecutive toss and choosing to field, a decision that historically has not led to wins at this venue. India's top order showed resilience, but the match remains finely balanced. The unfortunate incident with Pant has added an unpredictable element, as India awaits the results of his injury scan, potentially altering their strategy for the remainder of the game.</p>

Judge Steven Hippler condemned Kohberger as a "faceless coward" for his lack of remorse and the inexplicable nature of the slayings.

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of orchestrating a "cover-up" regarding President Joe Biden's mental decline, dismissing their recent push for transparency in the Jeffrey Epstein case as a hypocritical political maneuver. Johnson emphasized that House Republicans consistently advocate for transparency, contrasting it with what he perceives as Democrats' newfound interest in the Epstein files. This political clash unfolds amidst an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation into allegations that White House aides have obscured signs of President Biden's mental and physical state.

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on home sales, a move aimed at boosting the housing market. Under current law, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to capital gains taxes. The initiative, also proposed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, seeks to unlock equity for homeowners, especially seniors, and potentially alleviate housing shortages. However, experts warn of the significant cost and uncertain congressional support for such a measure.

          <p>Ashley Benefield, a former ballerina, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the manslaughter of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield, whom she fatally shot in 2020. The trial, which concluded with a manslaughter conviction, unveiled a tumultuous relationship marked by Ashley's claims of self-defense against alleged abuse, contrasted with the prosecution's argument that she sought sole custody of their daughter. The jury's verdict suggests a belief that the act was not premeditated murder but also not entirely justified self-defense. This complex case illuminates the challenging intersection of domestic disputes, personal narratives, and legal outcomes.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively debating the reintroduction of compulsory military service, a proposal put forth by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to bolster the Bundeswehr amidst escalating security threats anticipated from 2029. While the plan, which includes a hybrid model of voluntary and selective conscription, has presidential backing, industry leaders like Steffen Kampeter of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations voice concerns about its potential negative impact on the economy by delaying young people's entry into the labor market. The ongoing discussion weighs the imperative of national defense against potential economic repercussions and the feasibility of integrating vocational training within service periods.</p>

          <p>A contentious legal dispute has erupted in New Jersey regarding the interim appointment of Alina Habba, one of Donald Trump’s personal lawyers, as the top federal prosecutor. Her 120-day tenure has expired, prompting federal judges to appoint career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace as her replacement. Attorney General Pam Bondi quickly countered by announcing Grace's removal, creating uncertainty over who legally holds the U.S. Attorney position. This conflict underscores the Trump administration's readiness to challenge judicial authority and its controversial practice of appointing prosecutors with limited experience, potentially undermining the integrity of federal prosecutions.</p>
