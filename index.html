          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff negotiations, hoping to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June, according to Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. Discussions will focus on non-tariff barriers and expanding bilateral trade and economic security cooperation. Japan aims to present proposals, including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplified safety screening for imported cars, while the U.S. seeks to reduce its trade deficits and create better-paying jobs. The Trump administration prioritizes early tariff deals with strategically important countries like Japan to gain an upper hand over China in the Indo-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry announced it is evaluating the United States' offer for tariff negotiations, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to demonstrate sincerity by correcting its wrong practices and cancelling unilateral tariffs. The ministry insists that dialogue is impossible unless the U.S. ceases its unilateral tariff measures, which are viewed as damaging mutual trust. China's statement follows earlier impositions of high tariffs by both the U.S. and China, which have negatively impacted global markets and slowed down China's factory activity.

          <p>China is considering engaging in trade negotiations with the United States after receiving overtures from Washington, potentially easing the ongoing tariff war. A spokesperson from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that the U.S. must demonstrate sincerity by addressing its wrong practices and removing unilateral tariffs. This statement follows a series of conflicting signals from both countries, each seeking to avoid appearing to concede first. Dan Wang of the Eurasia Group suggests the statement does not indicate a shift in China's political stance.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States' fixation on "beating China" is misguided and that the US needs to focus on its own internal alignment of purpose, goal, and means. The author contends that the Trump administration lacks a coherent strategy for prevailing in the trade conflict, and that this chaotic approach is not unique to Trump. The piece suggests that the US needs a clearer understanding of its own objectives and capabilities to effectively address the challenges posed by China.</p>

After a difficult meeting with Zelensky, Trump has engaged in diplomacy with Putin, drafting a peace plan that offered concessions to Moscow. However, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin's demands, leading to a more friendly meeting with Zelensky at the Vatican.
