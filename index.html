        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many residents in Nevada, including seniors and military veterans, are facing increased food insecurity due to a combination of rising grocery prices and shifts in federal assistance programs. Southern Nevada's food banks, such as Three Square, are reporting a significant strain as demand for their services grows. Changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have created uncertainty for many recipients, as states must now cover more of the costs under stricter requirements. This situation forces many individuals who have never needed assistance before to turn to local pantries for essential supplies.</p>

          <p>Following the return of Democratic lawmakers who had left the state to prevent a vote, President Trump is publicly urging the Texas legislature to quickly pass a new congressional redistricting bill. The proposed map is highly contentious, as it could grant Republicans up to five additional seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Trump framed the initiative as a crucial battle for the country, thanking state GOP leaders for their work on what he called a "BIG, BEAUTIFUL CONGRESSIONAL MAP." The move is part of a larger national political struggle over electoral boundaries ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges related to the death of actor Matthew Perry. She will admit to distributing the ketamine that led to Perry's fatal overdose in 2023. Sangha is one of five individuals, including doctors and Perry's assistant, charged with supplying the actor with the drug. Her plea agreement also covers charges for selling ketamine that resulted in another man's death in 2019, highlighting a broader network that catered to high-end clients from what prosecutors called a "drug-selling emporium."</p>

          <p>Missouri's Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, has been appointed to serve as the FBI's co-deputy director, joining current second-in-command Dan Bongino. The appointment marks a notable departure from the tradition of selecting career FBI personnel for senior leadership roles. Bailey, known as a staunch Trump loyalist, has a background as a state prosecutor and has been involved in high-profile conservative legal battles, including defending Missouri's abortion restrictions. His selection reinforces the administration's direction for the nation's top law enforcement agency, placing key political allies in positions of significant power.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions Trump's Diplomatic Strategy After Mid-Summit Call to Putin</h2>

          <p>This article offers a critical perspective on President Trump's decision to call Russian President Vladimir Putin during a summit with European leaders about the war in Ukraine. The author argues that Trump's pursuit of a "land for peace" deal could result in Ukraine ceding its most strategically important defensive territories to Russia. This move is framed as a potential betrayal of Ukraine and Western interests, rewarding Moscow's aggression rather than penalizing it. The analysis suggests Trump's actions prioritize a deal with a leader he admires over established diplomatic principles and Ukraine's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The Washington meeting between President Trump, President Zelenskyy, and European leaders produced several key developments in the effort to end the war in Ukraine. A primary outcome was Trump's announcement that he had called Vladimir Putin to begin arranging a direct meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. The talks also revealed a divergence on strategy, with European leaders pushing for an immediate ceasefire, a condition Trump now seems to dismiss. Additionally, the U.S. hinted at providing Ukraine with significant security guarantees as part of a potential peace settlement, though specifics remain undefined.</p>

This excessive internal rivalry erodes profit margins, stifles innovation, and signals deeper structural problems within the Chinese economy that need to be addressed beyond simply curbing production incentives.

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to "lead a movement" to eliminate mail-in ballots and some voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections. He stated that an executive order is currently being drafted to achieve this, based on his unsubstantiated claims that these voting methods are corrupt and unreliable. However, legal experts cited in the article emphasize that the U.S. Constitution grants states and Congress, not the president, the authority to regulate the time, place, and manner of federal elections, making such an executive action legally dubious.</p>

          <p>A report from Kabul reveals the dire situation of women in Afghanistan's mental health facilities, who are often effectively trapped even after their condition improves. Many patients are victims of domestic abuse, and due to strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions, they cannot live independently and are frequently abandoned by their families. With no male guardian to return to, these women have nowhere to go, leaving them confined to overcrowded and under-resourced centers for years, sometimes for the rest of their lives, while others in desperate need of care are turned away.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the escalating federal and military presence in Washington, D.C., following President Trump's executive order. The deployment of National Guard troops from several Republican-led states has intensified, yet the administration has not defined a clear objective or endpoint for the operation, which was vaguely justified as a response to crime. The author suggests this lack of a stated goal is concerning, framing the takeover not as a structured plan but as an improvisational power grab that could normalize the use of military forces for domestic policing in American cities.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill to ensure that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive the interest earned on insurance payouts for properties damaged or destroyed by natural disasters. Previously, lenders could deposit these funds into an escrow account and retain any interest accrued during the often lengthy rebuilding period. This new legislation closes that loophole, guaranteeing homeowners at least 2% interest on their settlement funds, providing them with additional financial support as they recover and rebuild their lives after a catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist credited with discovering the coronavirus responsible for the 2003 Sars outbreak, has issued a stark warning that another global pandemic is inevitable. He expressed concern that the world may not be significantly better prepared than it was before Covid-19, particularly given the increasing frequency of viruses jumping from animals to humans. Peiris advocates for a more integrated "One Health" approach, which considers human, animal, and environmental health as interconnected, to build the necessary resilience to prevent or mitigate future catastrophic outbreaks.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent discharged his firearm at a moving vehicle during an immigration stop in Southern California. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the agent fired after the driver sped off and struck two officers. However, a video recorded by the driver's son, who was in the car, shows agents smashing the vehicle's windows before it drives away, with gunshots heard immediately after. The incident highlights the escalating tensions and conflicting accounts surrounding federal immigration enforcement tactics in so-called sanctuary states like California.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement that he is arranging a direct meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Kremlin has offered a notably lukewarm and noncommittal response. A Russian official stated only that Moscow would consider "raising the level" of the existing negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, making no specific mention of a presidential summit. This cautious language underscores the significant diplomatic challenges that remain in bringing the two leaders to the negotiating table, despite the high-profile push from Washington and European allies.</p>

          <p>General David Allvin, the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, has unexpectedly announced his intention to retire in the coming months. His departure is notable as he will have served just two years of the typical four-year term for the position. No reason was provided for the early retirement, which comes during a period where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed several other senior military officials. The announcement raises questions about stability within the Pentagon's top leadership and whether the decision was voluntary or requested by the administration.</p>

          <p>While the hastily arranged White House meeting on Ukraine was marked by a notably more cordial and well-mannered tone compared to past encounters, it yielded little in the way of concrete progress. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy appeared to make a concerted effort to show gratitude, which was met with a more complimentary President Trump. However, behind the improved optics, fundamental disagreements on key issues like a ceasefire and security guarantees persisted. The summit concluded with a promise of a future meeting with Vladimir Putin, leaving many critical questions about a path to peace unanswered.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece examines the broader implications of China's plan to build a new, large-scale embassy at the historic former Royal Mint site in London. The author argues that the sheer scale of the proposed diplomatic hub is a potent symbol of China's rising global power and its long-term strategic commitment to its relationship with the United Kingdom. The project is presented as a microcosm of the complex UK-China dynamic and a test of Britain's own international standing, especially when contrasted with the UK's recent trend of selling off prime diplomatic properties.</p>
