          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will invest over Â£1 billion in developing battlefield technology to expedite decision-making, leveraging AI and software, as revealed in the government's strategic defense review. This initiative, prompted by lessons from the war in Ukraine, aims to better connect soldiers with satellite, aircraft, and drone-provided information, enhancing target identification. The MoD also reported facing over 90,000 cyber-attacks in the past two years, leading to the establishment of a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command. The investment is supported by the government's commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, although the NATO Secretary-General is pushing for allies to exceed 3.5%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing sweeping tariffs, the Trump administration is expected to pursue alternative legal avenues. The court blocked the 10% baseline tariff and additional tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as an overreach. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest the administration could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 301, or Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930 to impose tariffs. James Ransdell from Cassidy Levy Kent notes that the appeal process is moving unusually fast and suggests the Supreme Court may ultimately decide the matter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will begin revoking visas for some Chinese international students, particularly those in "critical fields" or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This action, part of intensified scrutiny of ties between U.S. higher education and China, includes revising visa criteria to enhance vetting of future applications from China and Hong Kong. Beijing has criticized the move, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman stating the U.S. is unreasonably canceling visas under the pretext of ideology and national rights. This announcement follows increased scrutiny of U.S. universities' relationships with Chinese institutions and concerns over federally funded research being accessed by Chinese students.</p>

The issue of settlements remains a contentious point between Israel and the Palestinians, as settlements are widely regarded as illegal under international law, a view Israel disputes.</p>

          <p>Some celebrities are reportedly concerned about being called to testify in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial and have hired lawyers, according to TMZ founder Harvey Levin. The trial includes charges of racketeering conspiracy, sexual assault by force, fraud, or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Arson investigator Lance Jimenez testified about a car fire that damaged Kid Cudi's Porsche, suggesting it was targeted after Kid Cudi's testimony that he thinks Diddy was involved in setting the car on fire, and Diddy's former stylist, Deonte Nash, testified to witnessing Diddy threaten and physically assault Cassie. Levin suggests that if the jury believes Cassie's testimony about Diddy's coercive behavior, it could significantly impact the case.</p>

The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling, which was based on cases brought by the Liberty Justice Center and a coalition of US state governments.

          <p>The UK government has outlined its plans to reform the pension industry by creating Â£25 billion "megafunds" that will be instructed to invest a portion of their assets locally to stimulate economic growth. These reforms, designed to emulate the successful pension investment funds of Australia and Canada, aim to improve returns for workers and channel billions into clean energy and high-growth businesses. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is including a legislative back-stop to ensure progress by the end of the decade. The reforms will be part of the Pension Schemes Bill.</p>

          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled that Donald Trump's sweeping tariff regime is illegal, potentially blocking his controversial global trade policy. The court's decision, resulting from lawsuits arguing that Trump exceeded his authority, states that his tariff orders "exceed any authority granted to the president...to regulate importation by means of tariffs". Financial markets reacted positively, with the US dollar rallying, though the Trump administration has already filed an appeal. The ruling, if upheld, would significantly undermine Trump's strategy to use tariffs for trade concessions and to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota stated it will not pass the tariff costs onto consumers, analysts believe the company may face pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. Despite solid demand in the United States, Honda Motor Co. experienced a 4.8% drop in global sales, impacted by poor sales in China and Japan.</p>

Xi emphasized that self-reliance in advanced manufacturing is "the right path" for China and the "backbone" of its economy. While this push aims to achieve self-reliance, particularly in high-tech sectors, it could clash with the Trump administration's demands for China to address trade imbalances and reduce state subsidies to Chinese companies.

Starmer asserts that Reform's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown, warning that Farage is making the same bet as Truss by spending tens of billions on tax cuts without a viable funding plan. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that Reform's policy to raise the income tax threshold could cost between Â£50bn and Â£80bn a year, with no clear plan for funding it. Reform UK claims its policies would be funded by scrapping net-zero climate measures and other cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>China launched its first space mission, Tianwen-2, to retrieve samples from a nearby asteroid, potentially making it the third country to acquire pristine asteroid rocks. A Long March-3B rocket carried the probe from the Xichang launch site, with Tianwen-2 scheduled to reach asteroid 2016HO3 by July 2026 and return a capsule with samples to Earth in November 2027. The mission also includes exploring comet 311P. This marks another step in China's expanding space program, reflecting its ambition to become a leading space power.</p>
