          <p>Uber and Waymo have launched their robotaxi service in Atlanta, continuing their partnership's expansion. The service covers approximately 65 square miles around Atlanta, utilizing Waymo's driverless technology in electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs. This follows a similar launch in Austin, Texas, earlier this year, preceding Tesla's robotaxi service. The robotaxis will not operate on highways or travel to the airport initially, marking a cautious but significant step in the deployment of autonomous vehicles in urban environments, and the company hopes to expand the service after gathering data. The development represents the ongoing evolution and commercialization of self-driving technology in the transportation sector.</p>

One passenger recounted singing the Israeli national anthem and God Save the King on the flight, highlighting the passengers' spirit. The UK government has urged British nationals in Israel to register their presence and plans further evacuation flights based on demand and security, however the situation remains volatile.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, which was quickly followed by accusations of violations from both sides. Despite Trump's declaration and reported agreement from both Netanyahu and Iranian officials, the ceasefire faltered within hours, with Israel claiming Iranian missile launches and vowing retaliation, which Iran denied. Trump, en route to a NATO summit, expressed frustration and urged Israel to halt further attacks after speaking with Netanyahu, and he emphasized that he did not want regime change in Iran. The conflict between Israel and Iran began on June 13 with Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, leading to a series of retaliatory attacks and escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to preventing an "ongoing inflation problem," despite criticism from President Trump. Powell indicated that the Fed is likely to maintain its current policy stance until there is more clarity on the economic impact of tariffs. He characterized economic growth as strong and the labor market as near full employment, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. Powell's remarks come as Trump has intensified his criticism of the Fed's policies, but the Fed chair is expected to present these comments to congressional committees this week.</p>

          <p>Two young bears escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and consumed a week's supply of honey before falling asleep. The park reported that the bears, Mish and Lucy, posed no threat to the public, but visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. The park's keeping team used recall training to safely return the bears to their enclosure, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the escape, which was attributed to an "operational error." The park has initiated a full internal investigation to prevent future incidents, emphasizing that the structural integrity of the enclosure was not compromised.</p>

He later clarified that he is committed to saving lives and ensuring safety, promising to provide a more precise definition upon arrival at the summit.

Vance stated that the U.S. bombing aimed to prevent Iran from enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels, and he claimed the mission was successful in disabling Iran's capacity to convert the stockpile into weapons. However, former UN weapons inspector David Albright noted that some centrifuges are unaccounted for, indicating the problem is not entirely resolved. Vance indicated that the U.S. intends to engage in conversations with Iran regarding the stockpile's future, but Iran has expressed reluctance to discuss the matter.</p>

          <p>Purchasing a $400,000 annuity at age 70 can yield varying monthly payouts depending on factors such as gender, annuity type, and interest rates. For males, the monthly payout is around $2,923, while for females it's approximately $2,763 due to differing life expectancies, and a joint life annuity for a couple both aged 70 would yield about $2,449 per month. Interest rates influence annuity payouts, and elevated rates generally result in stronger payouts for new annuities, and optional riders like death benefits can reduce monthly income. The decision to purchase an annuity should be carefully considered, as it involves converting a lump sum into guaranteed income with limited accessibility to the original amount.

Affected customers report being banned without warning and dismissed when attempting to appeal the decision, and the retailer's fair use policy cites "unusual patterns of returns activity" as a reason for account closures.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his stance that the central bank should maintain steady interest rates, citing inflation risks stemming from U.S. tariffs. Powell acknowledged pressure from President Trump to cut rates, but he emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of tariffs, and he stated that the Fed's goal is to prevent tariff-related price increases from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. While some Fed officials have signaled the possibility of rate cuts due to a slowing labor market, Powell indicated that it would be premature to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate has reached a record high, driven by increased participation and contribution rates in retirement plans. In 2024, the combined savings rate for employee deferrals and company deposits was estimated at 12%, matching the record from 2023, according to Vanguard's analysis. Fidelity also reported all-time high savings rates, with a combined rate of 14.3%, and the increase is attributed to features like automatic enrollment and immediate eligibility for employee contributions. Experts suggest saving 12% to 15% of pay annually, including employer contributions, to ensure adequate retirement savings.</p>

          <p>Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's *28 Years Later*, a sequel to *28 Days Later*, reinvents the zombie genre with more developed "infected," odd human characters, and a dense plot. The film follows Spike, a 12-year-old boy in a post-rage virus England, as he seeks a cure for his ailing mother. Boyle uses a digital aesthetic, shot mostly on iPhones, to create a disorienting and immersive experience. The film explores themes of isolation and the reshaping of the human mind, while grounding its story in Spike's desire to save his mother.</p>

He stated that the system traps people on benefits and will lead to unsustainable cost increases for taxpayers. The Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill aims to make it harder for individuals with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment, but faces strong opposition due to concerns about increased poverty and inadequate impact assessments.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's decision to allow the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants, a DHS official praised the ruling, tweeting, "Fire up the deportation planes." The Supreme Court's three liberal justices dissented from the order, and Justice Sotomayor criticized the ruling as a "gross abuse" of the Court's discretion.
