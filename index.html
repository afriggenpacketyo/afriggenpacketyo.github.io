          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. forces in December 1942. Found over 2,600 feet deep near the Solomon Islands, the warship's discovery provides new historical insights, as no photographs of it were known to exist. The wreckage, located in two pieces, was found with its munitions, including sensitive depth charges, still intact, challenging previous theories about the cause of its sinking. The find is part of ongoing efforts to map the historic "Iron Bottom Sound," a site of numerous naval battles.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced via social media that he has secured a "great deal" with Indonesia, a major U.S. trade partner. The announcement comes just a week after he threatened to impose a 32% tariff on the country's exports to the United States. However, Trump provided no details about the terms of the agreement, stating that specifics would be released later. This approach mirrors a recent announcement regarding a trade deal with Vietnam, where Vietnamese officials were reportedly surprised by Trump's characterization of the preliminary terms.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of new weapons for Ukraine and a 50-day deadline for peace, Russia has projected an attitude of indifference. Kremlin officials stated they would analyze the "very serious" statements, while former president Dmitry Medvedev claimed, "Russia didn't care." The White House also confirmed discussions occurred about Ukraine potentially striking Moscow, which it framed as a question rather than encouragement. Despite the threats, Russia continued its drone attacks on Ukraine, and the specifics of the new U.S. military aid package remain under development.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. During the hearing, he addressed the administration's foreign policy on China and Russia and defended the U.N.'s role as a place for global dialogue, while acknowledging it needs "major" reform. Senators, particularly Democrats, questioned Waltz about his involvement in a Signal group chat where sensitive military details were inadvertently disclosed. Waltz defended the use of the app and stated that no classified information was shared, though he faced sharp criticism for his handling of the incident.</p>

The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin regulation bill that has already passed the Senate, is expected to become law. A more comprehensive bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define regulatory oversight between the SEC and CFTC, but faces a more uncertain path in the Senate due to concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's crypto ventures.

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose by 2.7% year-over-year in June, a slight increase from the previous month, as higher grocery prices were partially offset by lower gasoline costs. Economists attribute part of the inflationary pressure to the Trump administration's tariffs, with expectations that the full impact will become more evident in the coming months. Housing costs were the largest contributor to the overall increase, while prices for used cars and airline fares saw a slight decline. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, registered a 2.9% increase over the last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to nearly double its value from a year ago, briefly surpassing $123,000, driven by structural market changes rather than retail speculation. Massive inflows into new spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over $153 billion in assets, have tightened supply and attracted institutional investors. This wave of adoption includes financial advisors, corporate treasuries, and even sovereign wealth funds. The rally is also supported by a technical short squeeze and the prospect of clearer U.S. regulations, with Congress considering landmark crypto bills that could define oversight and encourage further mainstream financial integration.

          <p>The UK government has revealed it secretly operated a £400 million scheme to relocate 4,500 Afghans to the UK after a major data breach. In 2022, a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked a spreadsheet containing the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK assistance, putting them at risk from the Taliban. The government obtained a super-injunction to prevent the media from reporting on the leak or the subsequent relocation program. A High Court judge has now lifted the gagging order, citing free speech concerns and the need for democratic accountability.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly attempting to sign Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike in what could be a club-record deal, with an initial £70m bid being turned down. The move for the 23-year-old French striker has led some fans to worry it could signal the potential sale of their star player, Alexander Isak, who is a known target for Liverpool. However, the club maintains Isak is not for sale and that the interest in Ekitike reflects a desire to build a more versatile, multi-layered attack. Ekitike's ability to play in multiple forward positions could allow him to partner with Isak rather than replace him.</p>

          <p>An independent report on Britain's sewage-polluted waterways is expected to recommend tighter regulations and a major, expensive modernization of the nation's water infrastructure. For years, private water companies have faced criticism for illegal sewage discharges, which have contaminated rivers like the River Kennet and sparked public outrage. Critics argue that since privatization, companies have prioritized profits and dividends over necessary investments in the aging Victorian-era system. The forthcoming report, commissioned by the government, could lead to a regulatory reset aimed at tackling the systemic crisis and improving water quality across the country.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a staunch Trump ally, has publicly criticized the president's new plan to send billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine. In a social media post, she stated that "MAGA did not vote for more weapons to Ukraine," arguing the move breaks a key campaign promise to avoid involvement in foreign wars. Her criticism highlights a potential crack in Trump's political base, which has historically been skeptical of foreign aid. The dissent comes as the Trump administration pivots to a more interventionist stance, a change from the years Republicans spent blocking similar aid under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic gesture, China has lifted the sanctions it imposed in 2021 on Reinhard Buetikofer, a prominent former German member of the European Parliament. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to repair and normalize its relationship with the European Parliament. This development is expected to pave the way for the resumption of official meetings between the EU institution and China's National People's Congress, which have been frozen since 2018. The lifting of sanctions on Buetikofer, a vocal critic of Beijing, was reportedly a key demand from the European side before considering renewed engagement.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the UK government has released data detailing the immigration status of individuals receiving universal credit benefits. The figures show that in June, 83.6% of the nearly eight million claimants were British and Irish nationals. The remaining claimants included over a million people born overseas, primarily EU citizens with the right to live and work in the UK, as well as a small percentage of refugees and others on safe routes. The publication follows pressure from some conservative politicians and has fueled political debate about welfare system fairness and immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to give precedence to the Hindi language over English is causing controversy and resistance, particularly in non-Hindi-speaking southern states. India has 22 official languages and no single national language, with state boundaries drawn largely along linguistic lines. Critics view the promotion of Hindi as an attempt to impose a single culture on a diverse nation, undermining federalism. While the government frames it as a move away from the "colonial legacy" of English, states like Tamil Nadu have fiercely opposed policies they see as imposing Hindi through the education system.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's privacy commissioner has launched a criminal investigation into a scandal at the University of Hong Kong, where a law student allegedly created pornographic deepfakes of at least 20 female classmates and teachers. The case has sparked outrage and highlighted potential gaps in the law, as creating such images is not explicitly illegal, only their distribution. The university's initial response, a warning letter, was criticized as too lenient. The incident is the first high-profile case of its kind in the city, raising alarms about the misuse of AI for creating non-consensual sexually explicit material.</p>
