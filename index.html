          <p>A school in Borås, Sweden, was placed under lockdown after two suspected hand grenades were found nearby, prompting police to cordon off the area and call a national bomb disposal team. Approximately 800 students, parents, and teachers were informed and instructed to remain inside the school. This incident highlights a growing problem with explosives in Sweden, where criminal bombings, often involving smuggled hand grenades, have increased despite a decrease in shootings. Authorities suspect these incidents are largely carried out by criminal networks for intimidation purposes.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has reportedly rejected three takeover offers for Paramount, with the latest bid valued at just under $24 per share, primarily in cash. WBD confirmed receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties and is now expanding its strategic review process to consider all alternatives, while still planning to split into two separate entities. Companies like Netflix and Comcast are rumored to be among the interested bidders. This development led to a significant surge in WBD's share price, reflecting market recognition of its portfolio's value.</p>

          <p>Beyond Meat shares surged for a third consecutive day, with premarket trading seeing an increase of over 111%, fueled by meme traders. This rally follows the stock's inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and an announcement of expanded distribution at Walmart stores, which also triggered a short squeeze. Despite a long period of decline since its 2019 IPO, this week's dramatic comeback is reminiscent of earlier retail trading phenomena. The sudden resurgence of this penny stock is seen by some as a potential indicator of a frothy market environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean, with its center located southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Forecasters expect Melissa to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain to the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica through Saturday, with potential for significant flash flooding and landslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for Haiti's southwestern peninsula, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica, as the storm could strengthen to a hurricane. Its long-term path remains uncertain, but major impacts on the mainland United States are currently deemed unlikely.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has introduced new legislation aimed at reinstating federal funding for the Farm Service Agency and the SNAP food program amidst the ongoing government shutdown. Hawley stated his intention to pressure Democrats, accusing them of refusing to negotiate despite Republicans voting multiple times to fund the government. The shutdown, now the second-longest in U.S. history, continues as Democrats demand extensive budget changes, including an extension of Obamacare subsidies. This political standoff has prompted President Trump to take executive action for military funding, though other government functions remain stalled.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are finding affordable borrowing options through Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, with average interest rates currently at 7.84% for HELOCs and 8.13% to 8.28% for various home equity loan terms. These rates are significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards, making them attractive for tapping into the average homeowner's substantial equity. While home equity loans offer a fixed rate and lump sum, HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving credit line. Both options come with potential tax benefits for eligible home improvements, but homeowners must carefully consider the risks, as their home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

With anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, HELOC rates are easing, which could aid qualification for a higher limit.

          <p>The U.S. Army's secretive 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the "Night Stalkers," has been observed training in the Caribbean, fueling fears of potential U.S. military action to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power. This deployment, part of a larger military exercise involving B-52 bombers and F-35 jets, coincides with increased pressure from Donald Trump on Venezuela. Experts like Eva Golinger suggest a high probability of U.S. intervention, while Robert Evan Ellis views it as "calibrated military messaging" for a "controlled negotiation" to advance U.S. interests, potentially leading to Maduro's exit or a deal for natural resources.</p>

          <p>Gold prices fell for a second consecutive day, with futures down 1.49% to $4,053.10 per ounce, marking an 8% drop from Monday's intraday record high of $4,398. This pullback, the worst performance since 2013, is attributed to technical factors and speculative investors taking profits rather than macroeconomic events. Despite the recent decline, gold prices remain up over 50% this year. Analysts from UBS believe the long-term fundamentals, including inflation, tariffs, and political instability, that drove gold to record highs are still intact, suggesting the current pause is temporary.

          <p>Mortgage refinance applications increased by 4% last week and are up 81% compared to a year ago, driven by mortgage rates dropping to their lowest in a month.

Conversely, applications for home purchases declined by 5%, suggesting potential homebuyers are waiting for further rate reductions despite more market supply. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a prominent Christian nationalist, is under scrutiny for overtly integrating his faith into his official duties, leading regular Pentagon prayer sessions and describing the military's mission in biblical terms. Critics, including former Senator Chuck Hagel, warn that this deviates from Pentagon tradition and risks corrosive divisions within the secular armed forces. Hegseth, a member of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), espouses beliefs that challenge the separation of church and state, and his agenda at the Pentagon is seen by some as an attempt to diminish the roles of women and minorities. This in-depth article details his background, controversial views, and the impact of his leadership on military culture.</p>

          <p>Netflix shares dropped 7% in extended trading after the company missed third-quarter earnings estimates, citing an unexpected 10% tax expense from an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. The company's CFO stated that without this charge, operating income and margin forecasts would have been exceeded, and it's not expected to materially impact future results. Despite the earnings miss, revenue rose 17% due to membership growth, pricing adjustments, and record ad sales. Netflix projects continued revenue growth for Q4 and is expanding its consumer reach with product partnerships for its popular animated film, "KPop Demon Hunters." (not investment advice)</p>

Believed to have arrived via ballast water from cargo ships, this species smothers seagrass meadows and harms marine life, causing millions in losses. Despite the International Maritime Organization's 2017 convention requiring ballast water treatment, enforcement remains weak, with many countries not ratifying it.
