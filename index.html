          <p>Several UK newspapers are covering the historic Commons vote on the assisted dying bill, which narrowly passed and now faces a challenging path in the House of Lords, with potential opposition from peers. The Daily Express celebrates the vote as a victory for campaigners and choice, while The Guardian highlights the societal shift towards transforming end-of-life care. Other news includes a government plan to ban the Palestine Action group after a break-in at an RAF base, and the FT Weekend reports on a US private capital group's support for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The Daily Star claims Pope Leo XIV warns that AI is doing the devil's work and could be bad for kids, branding his remarks "Pope versus bot."</p>

          <p>President Trump has acknowledged a deadlock in diplomatic efforts with Iran but is giving them two weeks to "come to their senses," while dismissing European talks. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi insists Israel must cease attacks before negotiations can resume, a request Trump finds difficult to make. Trump also disputes his own intelligence community's assessment that Iran isn't building a nuclear weapon, asserting they are wrong and that Iran is close to having one. Analysts suggest Iran may use talks to buy time or accelerate its nuclear program amid ongoing conflict, raising concerns about the security of Americans in the Middle East.</p>

The service will be accessible via the Robotaxi App, with a "Tesla Safety Monitor" present in the front passenger seat and remote monitors overseeing the rides. This launch comes amid scrutiny from government officials and safety advocacy groups regarding autonomous vehicle safety, with concerns raised about Tesla's self-driving technology. If successful, the robotaxi service could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, potentially reaching $2 trillion by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>Rithy Panh's "Meeting With Pol Pot" fictionalizes the true story of Western journalists invited to interview the Khmer Rouge leader in 1978, revealing the cruel reality behind their proclaimed utopia. The film stars Irène Jacob as a reporter modeled after Elizabeth Becker, who is joined by a Maoist professor and a photojournalist, all growing increasingly horrified by what they witness. Panh masterfully depicts the tense atmosphere and the facade of hospitality, exposing the dangers of propaganda and the importance of confronting it. The director's use of clay figurines and archival footage adds a soulful sensibility to the mass tragedy.</p>
