          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests sparked by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, asserting that local authorities can manage the situation. The protests erupted after federal agents conducted raids in the fashion district and other areas, leading to numerous detentions. Federal and local officials have traded accusations regarding the handling of the protests, with ICE faulting local officials and police for their response. The LAPD has denied delaying their response, citing the deployment of chemical irritants by federal agents as a factor. Optimism surrounding the resolution of the conflict remains low.</p>

          <p>A Macau-based conglomerate, HN Group, is developing a luxury senior housing project in Zhuhai's Hengqin district, aiming to attract affluent retirees from Hong Kong. Serensia Woods, a 13,500-square-meter retirement community, will feature a hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa. The project seeks to capitalize on the limited high-end retirement options available in Hong Kong, where most seniors live at home without guaranteed professional care. With Hong Kong's aging population expected to increase significantly, the development aims to provide a high-quality lifestyle for retirees with the financial means. The average price at Serensia Woods starts at HK$10 million, reflecting its focus on the luxury market.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, Japan is re-evaluating its disaster preparedness, particularly regarding sanitation. The earthquake exposed the vulnerability of sewage systems, leading to unsanitary conditions and the term 'toilet panic.' Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets during disasters to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Efforts are underway to educate children on using portable toilets, addressing a lack of knowledge that exacerbated the situation in Noto. The government is also urged to stockpile portable toilets and ensure their availability in evacuation centers to avoid unhygienic conditions and protect public health.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's grueling '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Venture capitalists have sparked debate by suggesting that Europe needs to embrace overwork to compete globally. However, many European founders and VCs argue that this 'fetishization of overwork' is a myth and that sustainable innovation cultures are more effective. They emphasize the importance of work-life balance, worker rights, and access to funding and resources over simply increasing working hours. Ultimately, they believe Europe's startup ecosystem needs stronger funding and resources, not just longer hours, to thrive.</p>

He suggests that treating AI like children can inspire people to become better role models.

This comes shortly after the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages were also recovered. Meanwhile, Israel continues its military campaign in Gaza, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties, and says it adheres to international law while dismantling Hamas' capabilities.

          <p>An ancient Zambian writing system called Sona is being rediscovered, challenging the narrative that Africans did not have their own written languages. Sona, used by the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, involves geometric patterns conveying mathematical principles, messages about nature, and instructions on community life. The original custodians of Sona were women, and efforts are underway to document and revive this knowledge. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is leading the effort to archive and promote Sona, highlighting its significance in pre-colonial Zambian culture.</p>

          <p>The conflict between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has intensified uncertainty surrounding NASA's budget, which is facing significant cuts. Proposed budget reductions could lead to the termination of numerous science missions, impacting planetary exploration and climate monitoring efforts.

Consumer groups argue that the proposals don't go far enough, as airlines could still charge for overhead cabin bags.
