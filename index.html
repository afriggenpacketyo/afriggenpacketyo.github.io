          <p>President Trump asserted in an interview that he has secured 200 tariff deals and spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, although Chinese officials dispute these claims. Trump stated that the trade negotiations would conclude within weeks.

Russian authorities have launched a murder probe and accused Ukraine of involvement, though Kyiv has not commented. The bombing occurred as U.S. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, was expected to meet with Putin to discuss a U.S.-brokered peace plan for Ukraine. This incident is similar to previous attacks on Russians linked to Moscow's military actions in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have paralyzed many U.S. businesses, causing them to reassess their operations and supply chains. Tim Fulton, an airplane equipment manufacturer in Alaska, exemplifies this uncertainty, as tariffs on steel, aluminum, and goods from Mexico and Canada have disrupted his business plans. The imposition of 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and reciprocal tariffs from other countries have further complicated matters for American importers.</p>

          <p>Melody Farris was convicted of murdering her husband, Gary Farris, a prominent real estate attorney, and is now serving a life sentence. During her trial, her defense team blamed her son, Scott Farris, for the murder. Melody Farris claims that Scott wanted the farm to be his and that he framed her for the crime, planting evidence in the basement. Scott Farris denies any involvement and states that Melody is the only one who wanted Gary dead.</p>

          <p>Wildlife charities are recruiting volunteers to help spot glow-in-the-dark caterpillars at night using ultraviolet lights, as part of a conservation project in Bernwood Forest, River Ray and Otmoor Basin near Oxford. The new method is hoped to make surveying butterflies and moths quicker, revealing secrets about their behavior and evolution. Volunteers will be looking for caterpillars of the UK's five species of hairstreak butterfly, many of which are endangered or vulnerable.</p>
