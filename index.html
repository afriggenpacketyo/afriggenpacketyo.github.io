          <p>Seven men have been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after two people were assaulted outside the Iranian embassy in London. The Metropolitan Police believe the altercation occurred between protesters supporting and opposing the Iranian monarchy, with no apparent links to the conflict between Israel and Iran. Officers responded to reports of the incident in Princes Gate, Knightsbridge, and two men were treated for injuries, one taken to a major trauma center and the other to a hospital. Conditions have been put in place to prevent further disorder, prohibiting protests in the area until Sunday afternoon, and an eighth man was arrested for breaching this order.</p>

          <p>Ian Andersen, an American cyclist, recounts his harrowing experience escaping Iran after Israel began bombing Iranian sites. Andersen, who was cycling across seven continents, entered Iran on June 1 and initially found Iranians to be kind and hospitable. However, after June 13, when the bombings began, he sensed increased danger due to his American nationality. He and his guide, Reza, faced challenges including traffic jams, military checkpoints, and suspicion from locals before successfully reaching Azerbaijan after being interviewed by Iranian officials. Andersen urges Americans traveling abroad to register with the U.S. State Department's STEP program and hopes to raise money for Reza and his family who are still in Iran. The cyclist intends to continue his journey to Japan.</p>

          <p>Nancy Pexton, 69, has been charged with the murder of her 69-year-old sister, Jennifer Abbott, who was found stabbed in her Camden home. Abbott, also known as Sarah Steinberg, was discovered by her niece and neighbors after family members had not heard from her for several days; a post-mortem examination determined the cause of death as sharp force trauma. Police are investigating whether Abbott's death is linked to a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch from her home. Pexton has been remanded in custody and is scheduled to appear at the Old Bailey later this month, while neighbors remember Abbott as intelligent and vivacious.</p>

Concerns remain that the bill could run out of time or be blocked by peers who oppose it, as it is a private members' bill and cannot be carried over to a new parliamentary session.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller suggested the central bank could cut interest rates as early as July, sparking market reactions. Waller believes import taxes will only cause a one-time price increase and is more concerned about a softening labor market. However, rising oil prices, a declining dollar, and ongoing conflict in the Middle East could contribute to more persistent inflation. Additionally, the rising unemployment rate among recent college graduates may be due to technological changes rather than overall economic weakness, making interest rate cuts less effective.

The proposed changes, to be phased in over three years from 2026, aim to address the higher demand for council services and weaker council tax bases in poorer areas. The new system would also allocate more funding to areas with a higher share of properties in lower council tax bands.

          <p>The Trump administration is terminating the specialized LGBTQ+ suicide lifeline option (988 option 3), citing a lack of congressionally directed funding. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) stated that those who contact 988 will still receive access to skilled crisis counselors. Critics, including the CEO of The Trevor Project and Senator Tammy Baldwin, have condemned the decision as devastating and callous. They argue it removes a crucial resource for LGBTQ+ individuals in crisis, particularly during Pride Month.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve will release its annual stress test results next Friday, and analysts expect regulators will lower stress capital buffers for many top banks. Deutsche Bank analysts expect Wells Fargo to be a "winner" from the stress tests, which simulate economic downturns to assess banks' financial stability. The analysts noted that regulators required Wells Fargo to keep more capital in the emergency fund last year and now that the stress test is seemingly easier and Wells' exposure to troubled industries like commercial real estate has improved, it may get more relief from the Fed than peers. Wells Fargo could then lend more, boost revenues, and expand its investment banking division. (not investment advice)</p>

The court voted 7-2 to support a challenge to a waiver that has allowed California to set tougher standards than national rules since 1967. The ruling overturns a lower court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit by oil and gas companies, who claim the waiver causes financial harm. Environmentalists argue the waiver has helped push forward vehicle innovation and reduce greenhouse gases, but the ruling could unravel a key tool for curbing planet-heating emissions.</p>
