          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom to attend the WellChild charity awards in London, an organization for which he serves as a patron. His visit coincides with the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, and he paid his respects by laying a wreath at her burial site in Windsor. While in the UK, the prince has several other engagements scheduled, though there is public speculation about whether he will meet with his father, King Charles. Meanwhile, other members of the Royal Family, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, also attended events to commemorate the late Queen's legacy.</p>

          <p>France's government has collapsed after Prime Minister François Bayrou was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote, creating a significant political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron. The vote, which Bayrou himself initiated as a high-stakes gamble to push through unpopular budget cuts, failed decisively with a 364-194 result. This outcome forces Macron to appoint his fourth prime minister in just twelve months, signaling prolonged legislative deadlock and uncertainty for Europe's second-largest economy. The instability stems from Macron's 2024 snap election, which resulted in a fractured parliament without a clear governing majority.</p>

          <p>The ticket marketplace StubHub has revealed plans for its initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $851 million with a target valuation as high as $9.2 billion. The company intends to sell over 34 million shares at a price range of $22 to $25 each and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." This long-awaited IPO follows previous postponements due to market volatility and comes amid a recent resurgence in public debuts. Despite reporting revenue growth, StubHub's net loss widened in the first quarter, presenting a mixed financial picture for potential investors (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary order allowing President Donald Trump to proceed with the termination of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. The decision, penned by Chief Justice John Roberts, puts a short-term hold on lower court rulings that had reinstated the Biden-appointed commissioner. This case tests the president's authority to fire members of independent agencies, challenging a 90-year-old precedent from *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*. The legal battle has created significant uncertainty, with Slaughter being fired and rehired multiple times through the appeals process as the high court considers the broader constitutional questions at stake.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to allow federal immigration agents to continue conducting widespread enforcement raids in the Los Angeles area, lifting a lower court's injunction. The previous order had barred agents from making stops without reasonable suspicion and from relying solely on factors like race or occupation. This decision is a victory for the Trump administration's policy of increased deportations of undocumented migrants. The court's liberal justices dissented, arguing that the ruling puts constitutional freedoms at risk by permitting stops based on broad, potentially discriminatory criteria.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy has emerged on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester, with the artist confirming its authenticity via an Instagram post. The piece appeared shortly after mass arrests at a protest, leading to speculation about its political commentary on the right to protest and the legal system. Court officials have covered the mural and stated their intention to remove it to preserve the character of the historic listed building, while police are investigating the incident as potential criminal damage.</p>

          <p>Driven by global uncertainty, the price of gold has surged to a new record high, exceeding $3,600 per ounce, which marks a significant increase of over 38% since the beginning of 2025. The article explores whether it is too late for new investors to buy into the precious metal, citing bullish forecasts from major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. Analysts suggest that factors such as a weakening labor market and the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts could push prices even higher. Gold's traditional role as a portfolio diversifier and a hedge against economic instability is also highlighted (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jury selection has commenced in the trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to kill Donald Trump at his golf course last year. Routh, who is representing himself, faced immediate challenges as Judge Aileen Cannon barred most of his proposed jury questions for being irrelevant and politically charged. He has pleaded not guilty to five criminal charges, including attempting to kill a presidential candidate, which could result in a life sentence. Prosecutors allege Routh planned the attack for months, acquiring a rifle and hiding in the bushes before being spotted by a Secret Service agent.</p>

          <p>Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, is returning to his music career after a life-altering tongue cancer diagnosis in 2022. Surgeons removed most of his tongue and reconstructed it with tissue from his thigh, forcing him to relearn how to speak and sing. Now celebrating a year with no evidence of disease, Blevins has performed his first ticketed show since his surgeries. Inspired by his battle, he and his wife have launched a nonprofit called "The Tough Crowd Project" to provide financial aid and support to other families affected by cancer.</p>

          <p>Amid rising credit card balances and high interest rates, many Americans are exploring debt relief as a way to manage overwhelming financial obligations. This article provides an overview of various strategies, including debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, and credit counseling, which involves creating a structured debt management plan. More aggressive options like debt settlement, where a reduced payoff amount is negotiated, and bankruptcy are also explained. The article emphasizes that while these tools can provide a financial reset, they come with significant consequences for one's credit and long-term financial health (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years ago, Turkish-born florist Enver Simsek was murdered at his roadside stall in Nuremberg, becoming the first of ten victims of the neo-Nazi terror group known as the National Socialist Underground (NSU). For over a decade, his family endured suspicion from investigators, who wrongly pursued theories of criminal connections within the family itself. The NSU's existence was only revealed in 2011, exposing a shocking failure of German law enforcement to connect a series of racially motivated killings. Simsek's daughter continues to speak out, highlighting the family's suffering and the many unanswered questions that remain about the terror cell and its accomplices.</p>

This article outlines several options for federal loan borrowers, such as enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly payments to as little as zero based on current income. Other relief measures include applying for an Unemployment Deferment or an Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments.
