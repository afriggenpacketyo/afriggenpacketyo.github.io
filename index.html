          <p>The UK has received a temporary exemption from US President Donald Trump's executive order that doubles steel and aluminum tariffs.  This exemption is contingent upon the recently signed US-UK tariff deal, which aims to eliminate these levies entirely. However, the deal is yet to be enacted, leaving UK steel exporters vulnerable to tariffs until the agreement takes effect.  The article discusses the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for increased tariffs if the trade agreement falters.</p>

          <p>The article criticizes the Danish government's decision to exclude the Palestine question from school elections for children aged 13-16.  This decision, justified by the government as being too sensitive and complex for young people, is viewed as a failure to prepare them for democratic participation and an avoidance of crucial political issues. The author argues that the government's true motivation is to avoid confronting its own complicity in the ongoing conflict and its implications for Danish foreign policy. The article highlights the hypocrisy of the government's approach to free speech.</p>
