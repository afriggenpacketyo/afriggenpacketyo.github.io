          <p>Microsoft will invest $4 billion in a second data center in Wisconsin, complementing its initial $3.3 billion investment in a data center in Mount Pleasant, which is expected to be operational in early 2026. The Mount Pleasant data center will house Nvidia Blackwell GB200 chips for AI model processing. Microsoft aims to match its energy consumption with carbon-free energy contributions to the grid, including a 250-megawatt solar farm. The initial data center is being built on land originally slated for a Foxconn manufacturing plant. </p>

          <p>Nvidia is set to invest $5 billion in Intel to jointly develop data center and PC chips, causing Intel's shares to jump 24%. This partnership will tightly couple Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing with Intel's CPUs, expanding their ecosystems. The deal is supported by Softbank and the U.S. government, who invested in Intel last month. Intel will build x86 central processing units for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms and x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX graphics processing units for PCs. (not investment advice) Shares of Nvidia were also up 3% following the news of the deal. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval. </p>

Henson, who is charged with damaging government property and assaulting officers, reportedly said "Sic semper tyrannis" after the incident. The FBI is treating the event as an intentional act of terror and estimates the damage to exceed $1,000.

          <p>Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results with earnings per share below expectations but revenue in line with projections.

          <h2>Study Examines Stability of Gender Identities in Younger Children</h2>

          <p>A recent study explores the stability of gender identities in younger children who have transitioned from one gender to another. The research, conducted by Kristina Olson in the early 2010s, notes the increasing trend of social transition for minors, sometimes as young as three. It challenges previous controversies surrounding the transition of young children, highlighting a new understanding that trans children possess a clear sense of their gender identity. The study aims to provide insights into the long-term stability of these gender identities. </p>

          <p>A coalition of 22 attorneys general is opposing the Trump administration's proposed regulation that could narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The attorneys general registered their criticism in a letter to Education Department Secretary McMahon, arguing that the regulatory language is too vague. They say that the changes may delay or prevent forgiveness for a subset of borrowers and grant the Trump administration broad authority to exclude programs it doesn't approve of. The attorneys general argued that the vagueness of the regulatory language will lead to uncertainty regarding which employers are eligible for PSLF. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian drones struck a major Gazprom-run oil refinery in Russia's Bashkortostan region, igniting a fire approximately 1,400 kilometers from the front line. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) called it a strike on "the heart" of one of Russia’s largest facilities, aiming to cut Moscow’s war funds. The attack adds to a summer of refinery hits that have driven fuel prices up and forced Russia to extend a petrol export ban. Ukrainian troops and engineers are to work with Polish counterparts in a joint group to counter drones, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal says. </p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, former US ambassador to Germany, threatened to revoke the journalist visa of Elmar Thevessen, the US correspondent for German public broadcaster ZDF, over remarks he made about Charlie Kirk. Thevessen incorrectly stated that Kirk had advocated stoning homosexuals and made comments about Stephen Miller that Grenell deemed reminiscent of the Third Reich. The German Journalists' Association criticized the radicalization of public debate and the threat to press freedom. The German government voiced concern about the Trump administration's visa plans for journalists. </p>

          <p>A new Texas law allows people to sue anyone suspected of manufacturing, distributing, or mailing abortion pills to or from Texas, prompting strong reactions from abortion providers. Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (Map), vowed to continue providing care until legally unable to do so in Massachusetts. The law, set to take effect on December 4, could impose penalties of at least $100,000 on abortion providers who mail pills into the state. The law is expected to dramatically escalate the state-by-state showdown over abortion laws. </p>

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper suggests the Federal Reserve could implement a few more rate cuts, but easing too much risks economic dangers. He expressed concern that excessive easing could reignite inflation and create asset bubbles. Tepper acknowledged high valuations but remains constructive on stocks due to the current easing cycle. He emphasized the importance of balancing easing with maintaining some restrictiveness to avoid a weaker dollar and increased inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
