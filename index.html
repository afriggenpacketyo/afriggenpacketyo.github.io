          <p>Several airlines rerouted flights and canceled services in the Middle East following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. military base in Qatar, which heightened regional military tensions. Over twenty commercial aircraft bound for Doha were diverted, and flights heading to Dubai were turned around, while airspace over the UAE and Bahrain was temporarily closed. British Airways has canceled its Doha flights through Wednesday to ensure passenger safety amidst the ongoing developments. The situation remains under review as airlines prioritize safety in response to the escalating conflict. The safety of passengers and crew is paramount in light of the heightened security risks in the region, and airlines are taking necessary precautions to avoid potential dangers. </p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the absence of reported casualties raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil fell by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while Brent crude decreased by 7.18% to $71.48, reaching their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, resulting in no casualties, further easing concerns about supply disruptions. Energy Secretary Chris Wright credited President Trump's foreign policy for the potential de-escalation, contributing to a more stable outlook. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for suggesting that multiple countries are prepared to supply Iran with nuclear warheads following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump questioned the veracity of Medvedev's claim and cautioned against casually discussing nuclear weapons, while also boasting about the strength of U.S. nuclear submarines. Medvedev had criticized the U.S. strikes on social media, downplaying their impact on Iran, a Russian ally.

          <p>European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has advocated for a more realistic approach to EU-China relations, emphasizing security concerns following discussions among EU foreign ministers. While acknowledging China's significance as a trading partner and collaborator on climate change, Kallas highlighted issues such as China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, cyberattacks, interference in democracies, and coercive trade practices. These factors strain the relationship and make it difficult to continue business as usual, according to Kallas. The EU ministers also discussed the Middle East situation after the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, Gaza, and the Ukraine war. </p>

          <p>A workforce expert warns that AI's impact on the job market is inevitable, citing Amazon's plans to reduce its corporate workforce due to "efficiency gains" from AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy indicated that fewer people will be needed in some roles as AI is implemented, while new jobs will emerge in other areas. A World Economic Forum report found that 48% of U.S. employers plan to reduce their workforce because of AI, and other tech companies like Microsoft and Google are also reducing headcount.

          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, effectively branding the group a terrorist organization. This decision follows an incident where activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painted military planes red, an act Cooper deemed "disgraceful." If passed in Parliament, membership and support of the group would become illegal, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Palestine Action has called the government's action "unhinged" and asserts that their actions target companies arming Israel's alleged genocide. Cooper emphasized that this decision is specific to Palestine Action and does not affect lawful protest groups campaigning on issues around Palestine or the Middle East. </p>

The report estimates that medical debt would increase by $50 billion, a 15% rise over today's $340 billion in unpaid debts. Sen.

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling over 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a door latch issue that could trap passengers inside if the car's battery level drops too low. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) stated that the door latches may remain locked, preventing occupants from exiting, especially children. Ford is issuing a software update to address the recall and will notify owners of the safety risk. This recall follows another recent recall of over 1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a software glitch with the rearview camera. </p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about the impact on the oil and gas industry, with potential implications for higher energy prices.

GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan predicts U.S. gas prices could increase by 10 to 15 cents a gallon due to the Middle East tensions. (not investment advice) </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer 2025 arrives, homeowners may consider using home equity for expenses like vacations or tuition, but should do so strategically. Understanding the differences between home equity loans and HELOCs is crucial, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates while HELOCs provide a revolving credit line with variable rates. Shopping around for rates and terms can lead to better offers, and using equity for financially sound purposes like debt consolidation is advisable over discretionary spending. By making informed decisions, homeowners can leverage their equity effectively to improve their financial standing. (not investment advice) </p>
