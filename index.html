          <p>President Trump announced that May 8 will be recognized as World War II "Victory Day" in the United States, aligning with the "Victory in Europe Day" already celebrated by many allies since the German surrender in 1945. Trump emphasized America's significant role in achieving victory and noted that November 11 will also be recognized as World War I "Victory Day." Former President Harry Truman had previously declared August 14 as "Victory Over Japan Day" in 1946, but the U.S. currently lacks specific public holidays commemorating World War II. This move aims to celebrate and remember the country's victories in both World Wars, according to Trump. Optimism in this context is measured by the value of reflection and remembrance, even in times of discord.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order seeking to cut public funding for NPR and PBS, alleging bias in their news coverage. NPR and PBS receive taxpayer funds through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), though they heavily rely on private donations. Trump's order instructs the CPB Board of Directors and all executive departments to cease federal funding for these entities, claiming they don't provide fair or unbiased portrayals of current events. The CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027, raising questions about the order's scope, while media rights groups warn of deteriorating press freedom under Trump. This article discusses the implications of this decision on public broadcasting and media independence.</p>

          <p>More than 90 countries, including Japan, have called for preserving the memories of the atomic bombings during a U.N. meeting in preparation for the upcoming nuclear disarmament review conference. Led by Japan, the joint statement emphasizes the importance of testimonies from those who experienced the devastation caused by nuclear attacks, highlighting the contributions of the atomic bomb survivors' group Nihon Hidankyo. The statement warns that as time passes, firsthand accounts become increasingly rare, making each remaining testimony more precious. The initiative encourages all members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to ensure these stories are preserved and passed on to future generations.</p>

          <p>President Trump ended the "de minimis" tariff loophole, which allowed low-value goods to enter the U.S. without import fees, arguing it was a "big scam." The policy, initially intended for travelers, had become a significant channel for companies like Shein and Temu to ship cheap goods from China. As a result, parcels under $800 will now face levies, potentially increasing prices for consumers. The White House also claims the loophole facilitated the unchecked flow of deadly drugs like fentanyl. While China argues this will hurt American consumers, the move is expected to impact retailers and potentially disrupt Shein's IPO plans.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, posing a challenge to the dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. The party secured its first Parliamentary by-election victory in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating Labour, and also won the mayoral contest in Greater Lincolnshire. Reform UK's success has primarily come at the expense of the Conservatives, whose vote share has significantly decreased since the last local elections. While Labour retained several mayoralties, their vote share also declined, indicating a shift in the political landscape. This article highlights the growing influence of Reform UK and the potential for a more polarized, multiparty system in British politics.</p>

          <p>Russell Brand appeared in a London court facing multiple charges of sexual assault, including two counts of sexual assault. The charges relate to alleged incidents between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Brand has denied all charges, stating he never engaged in nonconsensual activity and looks forward to defending himself in court. This initial hearing was largely procedural, with the case being referred to a higher court for further proceedings, and a plea hearing is expected in about a month, but the trial may not begin for a year due to judicial backlogs.</p>

          <p>China is showing signs of easing its unofficial ban on K-pop acts, potentially signaling a shift to boost domestic consumption and foster regional goodwill. Analysts suggest K-pop is viewed as a tariff-proof sector, with revenue drivers like streaming, concerts, and fan content being digital and intangible. The move could also be a diplomatic strategy to restore ties with neighboring countries, including South Korea. K-pop stocks may benefit from China's reopening, with the country potentially accounting for a significant portion of concert revenue if restrictions are lifted.

Temu has been actively recruiting US sellers to join the platform, and the company states that the operational change will not affect pricing for US consumers.

Despite earnings falling compared to the same period last year, Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, described the results as "another solid set of results." The buyback program marks the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks, reflecting Shell's commitment to increasing shareholder returns and cutting spending, particularly in its liquified natural gas (LNG) push.

The judge determined that the act's language does not align with Trump's claims about the activities of the Tren de Aragua gang.

          <p>Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan is facing challenges with his cue at the World Championship, describing it as "awful" despite his successful run to the semi-finals. O'Sullivan is using temporary replacements from master cue craftsman John Parris after breaking his long-serving cue in January. Parris's cues can take almost a year to produce and cost up to £3,000, with customers facing long waiting lists. This article explores the importance of the bond between snooker players and their cues, and the difficulty in finding the perfect match.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement speech at the University of Alabama, blending traditional graduation advice with campaign rally material. He encouraged students to be ambitious and trust their instincts, while also touching on political grievances and issues ranging from egg prices to transgender rights. The speech, which included familiar advice alongside political rants, drew cheers from the largely receptive crowd. Despite protests against Trump's appearance, the commencement offered a glimpse into the resilience of his support outside Washington, D.C., and a gauge on the culture shift that led to his election.</p>

          <p>Apple is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices destined for the US market away from China, citing President Trump's tariffs as a key factor. India will become the primary manufacturing hub for iPhones sold in the US, while Vietnam will produce iPads, Apple Watches, and AirPods. CEO Tim Cook noted that US import taxes could add approximately $900 million to the company's costs this quarter. This move reflects the broader trend of companies adjusting their supply chains in response to global trade shifts and the US administration's push for domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., Ed Martin Jr., is facing scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans. Martin, a conservative activist with limited courtroom experience, has defended rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. His nomination has drawn opposition from veterans of the U.S. Attorney's office and raised concerns among some Republican senators. Martin's past political activities and his representation of Capitol riot defendants have fueled controversy and cast doubt on his ability to lead the office impartially.</p>
