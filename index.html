          <h2>Mike Waltz Seen Using Signal App Day Before Being Replaced as National Security Advisor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 22:03:12 EDT</div>

          <p>This article details how former White House national security advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app at a Cabinet meeting, a messaging app that President Trump had previously discouraged using after a leak controversy. The photo shows Waltz engaged in active conversations with several individuals, including Vice President JD Vance and potentially Secretary of State Marco Rubio. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly stated that Signal is an approved app for government use, but Waltz's past use of Signal to discuss military strikes had triggered controversy earlier in Trump's second term, making this instance notable. The article provides context regarding the administration's stance on secure communication methods.</p>

          <p>President Trump removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him to be the ambassador to the United Nations. The move follows criticism of Waltz for mistakenly including a journalist in a Signal chat where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources indicate that Trump respects Waltz but also felt he did not properly vet National Security Council staff. The BBC spoke with officials who suggested that the Trump administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing the president to get rid of him completely without having to fire him.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, with overall sales growth slowing to the lowest rate since the pandemic's peak, alongside a profit increase of 64 percent. The company anticipates sales between $159 billion and $164 billion for the current quarter, but operating profits may decrease due to factors including "tariff and trade policies". CEO Andy Jassy noted the company's focus on managing prices amid tariff uncertainty, including purchasing extra inventory and assisting sellers. While online sales grew modestly, Amazon's cloud computing business showed strong growth, driven by artificial intelligence offerings, although capacity constraints at data centers limited potential sales.

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to hold ministerial-level tariff discussions around mid-May, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial deal quickly, according to Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. Following meetings with U.S. officials, Akazawa reported deepened discussions on nontariff barriers, expanded bilateral trade, and economic security cooperation. Japan is expected to offer proposals including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplified screening processes for imported cars, while the U.S. seeks tariff reductions and better-paying jobs. The Trump administration has prioritized striking early tariff deals with Japan, India, and South Korea to gain leverage over China in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to remove temporary protected status for Venezuelan immigrants, a move blocked by a federal judge who cited procedural violations and racial bias. The administration argues that the law creating the program bars judicial review of executive branch decisions on TPS designations. A judge blocked the administrationâ€™s efforts to remove the protections for Venezuelans while the case moved forward, stating that terminating the initiative would inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of people. The Supreme Court has already addressed several emergency applications involving Trump's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton assesses President Trump's second term, describing it as even more incoherent than his first. Bolton argues that Trump lacks a grand strategy and operates primarily on reactions, with a focus on being the center of attention. While acknowledging some policy agreements, Bolton sees a lack of follow-through and increasing constitutional infringements, including targeting political opponents. Despite these concerns, Bolton does not believe Trump poses an existential threat to the republic, expressing confidence in the strength of American institutions.</p>

          <p>As President Trump pushes for a second baby boom, more couples are choosing child-free lives, citing economic costs, climate change fears, and career priorities. The U.S. fertility rate has plummeted to record lows, with some young adults saying they simply don't want children. Sociologist Amy Blackstone notes that child-free individuals often value their relationship with their partner and don't want to change it, while parents value the imagined relationship with a child. While some child-free individuals have occasional doubts about the future, they made the decision with careful thought.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Hutchinson, a Gulf War veteran, was executed in Florida for the 1998 shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children. Hutchinson had claimed innocence and attributed the killings to a government conspiracy related to his activism on Gulf War illnesses. However, court records indicated that Hutchinson had argued with his girlfriend, packed his belongings, and made incriminating statements before the killings. His defense, based on a claim of unknown assailants, was rejected by the jury. The execution proceeded after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a final appeal.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that most iPhones sold in the U.S. will be manufactured in India, while most iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods will originate from Vietnam. This shift aims to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs on its supply chains, sales, and profit margins. Although most iPhones still continue to be produced in China for sale outside of the United States, Apple's sales in China fell 2.3% to $16 billion in the March quarter. Despite this, overall earnings and revenue were up, driven by sales increases in other regions.</p>

          <p>Cambodia continues to struggle with the deadly threat of landmines, a remnant of decades of conflict stemming from the Vietnam War.

Self Help DeMining, an organization operating in Cambodia, is working to clear these landmines, but the work is dangerous and has resulted in fatalities. The article highlights the ongoing impact of past conflicts on Cambodia and the challenges of removing these deadly remnants.</p>

          <p>Annual May Day rallies, traditionally focused on worker's rights, were amplified this year by the breadth of the anti-Trump movement, addressing issues like immigration, education, and executive power. Protesters denounced the administration's efforts to roll back worker's rights, cut education funding, and carry out mass deportations. Rallies took place in major cities and small communities, with demonstrators expressing anger about the "threat to democracy" posed by President Trump. The protests coincided with traditional May Day labor rallies and a National Law Day of Action, reflecting widespread opposition to the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz implemented a "soda tax" on Thursday, adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban signed in 2018. The tax applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute such a tax since the statewide ban was enacted. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Assn., which opposed the measure. The American Beverage Assn. argues the tax unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine has shifted, with frustration now directed toward Vladimir Putin rather than Volodymyr Zelensky. Despite a disastrous meeting with Zelensky earlier, Trump has engaged in diplomacy with Putin, but is now showing impatience with Putin's demands. This shift comes as the U.S. announced an economic deal with Ukraine, and Trump and Zelensky had a friendly meeting at the Vatican. Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions, given Trump's zigzagging approach and conflicting advice from aides.</p>

The article discusses the use of "constructive ambiguity" and the potential for a third party to mediate. Both leaders face domestic pressure due to the tariffs, and a de-escalation would benefit both sides.</p>
