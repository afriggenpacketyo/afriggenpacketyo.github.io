        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing public criticism for stating he had never bought rice due to receiving it as gifts, which angered citizens dealing with soaring rice prices. Inclement weather and protective policies have contributed to the price surge, causing discontent with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government, whose approval ratings have plummeted. The agriculture ministry's efforts to curb prices by releasing government stockpiles have proven ineffective. Rice prices have reached all-time highs in supermarkets, driven by panic hoarding and a preference for domestic rice, exacerbating inflation and angering consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK inflation has climbed to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in over a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills such as water, gas, and electricity. The Office for National Statistics notes that housing, household services, transport, recreation, and culture contributed significantly to the rise. This figure exceeds economists' expectations and pushes inflation further above the Bank of England's 2% target, casting doubt on predictions of additional interest rate cuts this year. Core inflation and services inflation have also risen more than anticipated, raising concerns among analysts and politicians about the increasing cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage applications decreased by 5.1% as interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.92%, the highest level since February. This increase, driven by concerns about rising inflation and deficits, has cooled the spring homebuying season despite increased listings. Applications for both home purchases and refinancing fell, with potential buyers expressing caution about the economy. With rates nearly matching those of the previous year, fewer borrowers can benefit from refinancing, further dampening mortgage demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Murray's 2015 book, "By the People," advocated for wealthy donors to fund civil disobedience against the regulatory state, reflecting extreme hostility to liberal governance and skepticism of democracy. This article argues that the book's ideas prefigured Donald Trump's attacks on government functions during his second term, particularly through DOGE's gutting of federal agencies. Murray's belief that the American government is no longer worthy of respect resonates with mainstream conservatives, explaining their acceptance of Trump's actions. The article suggests that Murray's work provides insight into how the conservative movement rationalizes breaking laws to shrink the state, viewing it as rescuing the Constitution from liberalism.</p>

          <p>According to the New York Times, investors are increasingly concerned that tax cuts pushed by the Trump administration are amplifying debt and deficit concerns, influencing interest rates. The market is on edge due to the administration's tariff policy, and the tax cuts are setting off bond market turmoil. Volatility in the Treasury market could add to economic uncertainty, with investors potentially demanding higher interest rates. Moody's downgraded the United States' top-tier rating, leading to condemnation from Trump's economic advisors, though some investors remain skeptical if Congress does not make substantive changes to the current bill.

          <p>According to the New York Times, a bipartisan effort to downgrade marijuana from the government’s most restrictive class of drugs has effectively stalled under the Trump administration, despite initial support. Resistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (D.E.A.) slowed the process during the Biden administration, leading to legal challenges and setting the stage for a protracted legal fight. The Trump administration has released a drug policy blueprint making no mention of marijuana, and nominated a critic of cannabis legalization to run the D.E.A., signaling a shift away from looser cannabis regulations. The article suggests that the window of opportunity for cannabis rescheduling has narrowed considerably.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Upholds Wild Camping Rights on Dartmoor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 06:20:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission was required. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, including camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling, emphasizing responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers.</p>

Dozens of trucks have crossed into Gaza at the Kerem Shalom crossing, but the United Nations has been unable to move them to warehouses due to fears of looting. The delays have left Gazans waiting, with limited supplies and soaring prices. The situation is so dire that Gazans are at "critical risk of famine," according to U.N.-backed experts, with tens of thousands of children potentially suffering from acute malnutrition.</p>
