          <p>Scientists have confirmed the discovery of the Jinlin crater in China's Guangdong province, marking the fifth confirmed impact crater in the country and the first in its southern region. Research published in the journal *Matter and Radiation at Extremes* suggests the crater was formed by an asteroid impact approximately 10,000 years ago. The energy released from this event is estimated to be equivalent to 600,000 tons of TNT, which is comparable to the blast from about 40 atomic bombs.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that family offices, the private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, are adopting more cautious investment strategies in response to market turmoil from tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Many now see cash and liquid assets as the best source of returns for the next year, a significant shift from their previous focus on growth equities. Concerns over the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and lower-than-expected returns from private equity are driving this pivot toward liquidity and risk mitigation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philip Pullman's latest book series, "The Book of Dust," serves as a companion to his controversial "His Dark Materials" trilogy and delves into the concept of dangerous ideas. The new narrative centers on books that promote a form of moral relativism, causing the protagonist Lyra to become estranged from her soul, metaphorically speaking. This theme ironically reflects the past criticisms from religious groups who claimed Pullman's own work was spiritually dangerous, creating a complex commentary on censorship, the power of literature, and the ongoing culture wars over which ideas are appropriate for children.</p>

          <p>New U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are severely impacting the garment industries in countries like India, Vietnam, and Lesotho, threatening decades of economic progress. These nations leveraged the fast-fashion supply chain to lift millions out of poverty, but steep import fees on their textile exports are causing production to halt and factories to close. The policy not only risks raising prices for American consumers but could also unravel the fragile economic stability of workers in developing countries whose livelihoods depend on this global trade.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that American politics is experiencing a bipartisan moral collapse, characterized by the normalization of puerile and violent rhetoric from figures on both the left and the right. Citing recent examples of offensive and threatening comments from Young Republicans, a Trump nominee, and Democratic candidates, the author suggests this trend may stem from a loss of privacy or a genuine radicalization of younger generations. This normalization of extreme language reflects a deep loss of trust in democratic institutions and a growing numbness to political scandals.</p>

          <p>Susan Straight's tenth novel, "Sacrament," is a powerful homage to the intensive care unit nurses who battled the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a San Bernardino hospital. The story focuses on a small group of nurses living in trailers to protect their families, capturing their exhaustion, isolation, and the profound emotional toll of their work. Praised as the "bard of overlooked California," Straight uses her deep connection to the region and its diverse communities to create a moving narrative about interdependence, sacrifice, and resilience.</p>
