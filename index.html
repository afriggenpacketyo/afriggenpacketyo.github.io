        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially withdrawn its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of a significant crypto enforcement action. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and unlawfully enabling trading in unregistered securities. This dismissal comes as the Trump administration aims to demonstrate its support for the crypto industry, following the Justice Department's shutdown of its crypto enforcement team and the likely appointment of a venture capitalist with crypto ties to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Binance is also increasing its ties with World Liberty Financial, a project linked to the Trump family, and expanding its operations in Pakistan. Optimism regarding the future of Binance is rising as a result of these developments. </p>

          <p>Costco's shares experienced a slight dip despite the company surpassing earnings and revenue estimates for the fiscal third quarter, with an 8% increase in sales year-over-year. While Costco does not provide an annual outlook, company leaders discussed the challenges and increased costs associated with tariffs during an earnings call. The company is actively seeking methods to mitigate tariff costs while maintaining low prices, including expediting orders to the U.S. before tariffs take effect and sourcing more private-label items domestically. Despite these efforts, Costco has absorbed some tariff-related cost differences while increasing prices for certain discretionary items, like flowers. Despite the challenges, Costco's limited approach to the variety of items they sell helps them to negotiate prices with suppliers more closely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbase, Texas, the town housing Elon Musk's SpaceX facilities, has notified some residents that they may "lose the right to continue using" their property as they currently do. This warning is due to the consideration of a new zoning ordinance and citywide map, with a public hearing scheduled for June 23. The proposed "Mixed Use District" would allow for residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses. Starbase was officially formed earlier this month and is now managed by officials who are SpaceX employees or former employees. The change in zoning could impact the residents of Starbase. </p>

          <p>Despite sanctions, Russia continues to generate billions from fossil fuel exports to the West, funding its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Data reveals that Western allies have paid Russia more for hydrocarbons than they have provided Ukraine in aid. While the US and UK have banned Russian oil and gas, and the EU has banned seaborne crude imports, loopholes and refining processes in third countries allow Russian fuel to reach sanctioning nations. Campaigners urge Western governments to intensify efforts to cut off Russian oil and gas revenues to hinder its war efforts, but some policymakers fear higher energy prices.

          <p>Director Ryan Coogler attended a special screening of his film "Sinners" in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the town where the movie is set, following a community petition. The film, starring Michael B. Jordan, is a supernatural vampire flick set in 1930s Mississippi that blends drama, action, and music. Coogler expressed that working on the script and visiting Mississippi had a profound impact on him. The event was significant because Clarksdale lacks a movie theater, making it difficult for residents to see a film about their own hometown. The crowd's enthusiastic response to the screening underscores the film's connection to the community. </p>

Critics argue that these actions lead to citizens being caught in the dragnet and undermine local economies.
