            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-08 19:14:20 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the White House must restore access to Associated Press journalists, who were previously restricted due to a dispute over the term "Gulf of America." The judge found the restrictions violated the First Amendment, as the AP's exclusion from presidential events was based on viewpoint discrimination. The ruling temporarily pauses implementation to allow the administration time to appeal, while affirming the press's right to report freely without government retaliation. The AP's access to events covered by the press pool will be reinstated, ensuring fair coverage.</p>

            <p>The State Department has significantly reduced foreign aid, impacting countries like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia, leading to concerns from aid organizations like the World Food Programme. The cuts, totaling over $1.3 billion, include terminating contracts for food, water, and medicine delivery. The State Department claims some programs were cut due to concerns about funding benefiting terrorist groups, while others involved a move away from cash-based assistance. Critics argue the cuts could result in a "death sentence for millions" facing extreme hunger, marking a reversal from previous exemptions granted after initial aid reductions.</p>

Data suggests that Europe is using more palm sludge waste for biofuels than the world can produce, raising suspicions of non-waste materials being used. The investigation aims to ensure the sustainability claims of HVO diesel are valid and to address concerns about the fuel's impact on the environment.</p>

Factors contributing to the issue include poor hygiene habits, high consumption of sugary drinks, and stress-induced teeth grinding.

            <p>Ukrainian forces have captured two Chinese nationals fighting for the Russian army in the Donetsk region, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Intelligence suggests that the number of Chinese soldiers in Russia's army may be higher than initially reported. Ukraine's foreign minister condemned Russia's involvement of Chinese citizens and summoned China's envoy for an explanation, questioning China's neutrality. The US State Department called the reports "disturbing," citing China's role as a "major enabler" of Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has claimed that the measles outbreak in western Texas is slowing down, but data and public health specialists contradict this assertion. Kennedy cited increased CDC involvement as a factor, but data from the Texas Department of State Health Services indicates that cases are still increasing. Experts express skepticism, suggesting that the number of cases is likely underreported and that the outbreak is far from under control. They also warn against promoting unproven treatments and emphasize the importance of vaccination.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot exclude Associated Press (AP) journalists from press events in the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other secure locations. Judge Trevor McFadden stated that the White House's actions violated the First Amendment by restricting access based on viewpoint. The ruling comes after the AP was barred from certain events due to its refusal to adopt the Trump administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The AP has expressed gratitude for the court's decision, affirming the importance of a free press.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to cut a $500 million grant for a key U.S. steel project in Middletown, Ohio, despite promises to bolster the manufacturing industry. The grant, intended for Cleveland-Cliffs, would have upgraded blast furnaces to be powered by cleaner energy sources. Critics argue that the cuts, influenced by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, contradict promises of job creation and climate-friendly initiatives. The decision has sparked concern among residents, unions, and climate advocates, who fear the loss of jobs and the promotion of dirtier fossil fuels.</p>
