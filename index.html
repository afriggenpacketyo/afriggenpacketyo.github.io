          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. The company announced that discussions were terminated because JD.com sought to proceed only on a "materially revised set of terms." Sainsbury's concluded that accepting these new terms would not be in the best interests of its shareholders. Despite the collapsed deal, the supermarket chain reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve an underlying operating profit of around £1 billion by the 2025-2026 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has claimed the men's 100m world title in Tokyo, becoming the first Jamaican man to win a global 100m final since Usain Bolt in 2016. The 24-year-old sprinter, who trains with Bolt's former coach Glen Mills, delivered a personal best of 9.77 seconds to secure the gold medal. The victory marks a significant moment for Jamaican athletics, especially after Seville faced disappointment in previous major championships. His triumph, celebrated by an emotional Bolt in the stands, suggests a potential shift in sprinting dominance back to the Caribbean nation.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling race in Madrid was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course, knocking down barriers and occupying the road. The demonstrations, which were anticipated by authorities, disrupted the planned route through the city center. As a result of the cancellation, Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard, who was the leader entering the final stage, has been declared the overall winner of the prestigious race. Protests targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team had occurred throughout the event, causing previous stages to be shortened and raising safety concerns among riders.</p>

          <p>University of Chicago professor Robert Pape discussed the assassination of Charlie Kirk within the broader context of what he terms the "era of violent populism" in the United States. In an interview, Pape identified a rising trend of political violence and a corresponding increase in public support for such actions on both the right and the left. He cited his research, which indicates that major social changes, particularly the nation's demographic shift toward a white-minority democracy, are the root cause of this radicalization. Pape emphasized that while the internet acts as an accelerant, it is not the fundamental driver of the violence.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, urging the party to remain united to secure a second term in government. In a speech, she paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and warned against internal divisions that could benefit political rivals like Nigel Farage. The contest is seen by some as a reflection on the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations. Phillipson will be competing against former Cabinet colleague Lucy Powell for the influential party position.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's perfect start to the Premier League season has been characterized by a series of dramatic, late-game goals, drawing comparisons to the famous "Fergie Time" of Manchester United's past.

This pattern has established a psychological advantage for Liverpool, creating an aura of inevitability that they will find a way to win, even when not playing at their best.

          <p>Data from NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission has revealed crucial information for future planetary defense efforts. When the DART spacecraft intentionally collided with the asteroid Dimorphos, it ejected over 35 million pounds of rock and dust. This plume of debris created a rocket-like effect, providing a much greater push to alter the asteroid's orbit than the impact alone. The experiment confirmed that Dimorphos is a loosely-bound "rubble pile," a structure common among near-Earth asteroids, indicating that this ejecta effect will be a critical factor in designing future asteroid deflection missions.</p>

These services allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, posing a direct challenge to the revenue models of credit card companies. However, banks and other financial institutions are wary because BNPL usage often represents a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile, as these short-term loans are not typically reported to credit bureaus.

          <p>American sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden won her first world title in the women's 100m with a dominant performance in Tokyo. The 24-year-old clocked an extraordinary 10.61 seconds, a new championship record that makes her the fourth-fastest woman in history. The race saw her pull away from the field decisively after the first 30 meters, leaving Jamaica's Tina Clayton to take silver and Olympic champion Julien Alfred to secure bronze. The victory caps a remarkable season for Jefferson-Wooden, who has significantly lowered her personal best time after an injury-affected 2024 season.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that Britain will not surrender its national flag to those who use it for violence and division. His comments followed a "Unite the Kingdom" march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, which drew over 150,000 people and resulted in clashes with a counter-protest. Starmer emphasized that the flag represents the nation's diversity and tolerance, and that intimidation on the streets will not be stood for. The protests led to 26 police officer injuries and 24 arrests, prompting a large-scale policing operation.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Against US Tipping Culture, Citing New Tax Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 10:00:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article critiques the American culture of tipping, arguing that it is being further entrenched by President Trump's new "no tax on tips" law. The author contends that while the law may benefit some workers, it shifts the burden of providing a living wage from employers to consumers and creates confusion about who is eligible. The piece suggests that instead of incentivizing tips, the government should encourage employers to pay fair wages, similar to practices in other parts of the world. The author concludes by advocating for a permanent, revised system if tipping culture is to remain.</p>
