          <p>Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, widely known for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54. Officials in Costa Rica confirmed he passed away in an accidental drowning after being pulled out to sea by a current while swimming at a beach. Beyond his iconic 1980s role, Warner had a multifaceted career as a director, a Grammy-winning musician, and a poet, recently hosting a podcast on Black American experiences. Colleagues and friends remembered him as a kind and humble person who was conscious of his cultural impact and platform.</p>

          <p>The historic Ryde Hotel in the California Delta is investigating the disappearance of most of its beloved resident peacock flock, with theft being the primary suspicion. Staff discovered only four of the several dozen peacocks remained after a guest reported seeing two men forcing one of the birds into a cage. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a felony, given the high value of the birds, which can be sold on the black market for their meat or as exotic pets. Hotel staff are concerned for the welfare of the missing peacocks, which have been a cherished feature of the property for over a decade.</p>

          <h2>Newly Released Archives Detail Concerns Over Tony and Cherie Blair's Designer Clothing Discounts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Documents from the UK's National Archives reveal that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothes, causing concern among Downing Street officials. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair acquired over £75,000 worth of clothing while paying only £31,000, thanks to "wholesale" prices negotiated by her personal shopper. Officials worried these benefits would need to be declared under a new ministerial code and advised the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts. The files highlight the internal debate over the public perception and ethics of such arrangements.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly rent for a new tenancy in the UK has surged by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. This sharp increase is attributed to high demand from tenants coupled with an insufficient supply of available rental properties. The rising costs are forcing some individuals to turn down job opportunities or move to different regions, while many parents are providing financial assistance to their adult children. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, especially in major cities, affordability remains a significant challenge for renters across the country.</p>

          <p>Rare, close-up images of China's fifth-generation J-35 stealth fighter suggest the aircraft has entered production and is nearing operational readiness. The photos, which circulated on Chinese social media, show the jets with official naval markings and "Flying Shark" tail insignia, providing the strongest evidence yet of their formal integration into the navy's carrier aviation force. Military observers note that the clear identification marks and serial numbers indicate a low-rate initial production run. This development marks a significant step in modernizing China's naval capabilities, particularly for its newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian.</p>

He remained stuck for nearly an hour and later died from multiple heart attacks following the incident.

          <p>The investigation into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, is mired in controversy following the release of a preliminary report. The central issue is a cockpit voice recording where, seconds after takeoff, one pilot asks the other why they initiated the fuel "cut-off," a move that starved the engines of power. This detail has fueled intense speculation about pilot error or intentional action, prompting India's accident investigation bureau to condemn premature conclusions from the media. Investigators caution that while manual action seems likely, a technical glitch has not been ruled out, and the full story remains unknown.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. This program grants temporary protection from deportation and work permits to individuals whose home countries are deemed unsafe. The administration argues the conditions in both nations have improved enough for their citizens to return, a claim disputed by advocacy groups who cite ongoing conflict and repression. While the court allowed the phase-out to begin, it noted the underlying lawsuit against the policy has merit and should be heard expeditiously.</p>

          <p>Critics, including former Republican officials and Democratic strategists, are accusing President Trump of attempting to divert public attention away from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. They point to a recent flurry of social media posts on unrelated and often inflammatory topics, such as demanding the Washington Commanders revert to their old name. This follows a DOJ announcement that it would not release more Epstein files, a reversal that angered many of Trump's own supporters. Prominent figures like Rev. Al Sharpton and Sen. Adam Schiff have labeled these actions a transparent effort to distract from the issue.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining by exposing and forcing other countries to address their own internal trade barriers. Nations like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing domestic regulations and protectionist policies that hinder their own economic growth. The pressure from U.S. tariffs is reportedly creating an incentive for these governments to streamline commerce and remove self-defeating restrictions. The article suggests this unintended consequence could lead to significant, positive economic reforms abroad, even as the tariffs themselves remain controversial.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of stocks, which he calls "PARC" (Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase), that he believes have continued momentum due to strong support from retail investors. He describes a "two-track market" where these trendy names operate with different dynamics than the broader S&P 500. While Cramer acknowledges that these stocks have seen significant gains and are likely to rebound from pullbacks, he advises investors to exercise discipline. He suggests that while there is money to be made, investors should secure profits when they see a large gain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth's rotation has been speeding up, causing days to become marginally shorter and raising a unique challenge for global timekeepers. This trend could eventually require the unprecedented removal of a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an event known as a "negative leap second." While leap seconds have been added in the past to account for a slower rotation, a subtraction has never been performed and raises concerns about its impact on computer systems, satellites, and telecommunications. Interestingly, scientists note that the melting of polar ice due to climate change is counteracting the acceleration, slightly delaying this potential timekeeping crisis.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi air force training jet crashed into a school campus in a suburb of Dhaka, killing at least 20 people and injuring over 170. The F-7 jet reportedly suffered a mechanical fault shortly after takeoff and slammed into a two-story building at the Milestone School and College. The pilot, who was among the deceased, had attempted to navigate the failing aircraft toward a less populated area. Eyewitnesses described a horrific scene of fire and smoke, with one student recounting that his best friend and several parents waiting for their children were killed in the impact.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis details how the Trump administration is increasingly using the judicial system to enact its policies, fundamentally altering the balance of presidential power. Following several key Supreme Court victories that bolstered presidential immunity and limited lower courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions, the administration has aggressively challenged judicial authority. This strategy involves a high volume of executive orders and direct criticism of judges, which some legal experts describe as an unprecedented assault on the judiciary. The article explores whether this represents a permanent reshaping of power between the executive and judicial branches of government.</p>

The group specifically criticizes the use of socioeconomic status as a proxy for race to circumvent the Supreme Court's ruling against affirmative action.

          <p>Former Kentucky police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Although his ten shots did not strike anyone, the judge found he acted recklessly by firing blindly into the apartment. The sentence came despite a controversial recommendation from the Trump-led Justice Department for only one day in prison, a stark contrast to the approach under the previous administration which brought the charges. Hankison is the only officer to be convicted and sentenced in direct connection with the fatal raid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that small-minded pettiness and personal vengeance, rather than coherent policy, have become the animating forces of the Trump administration. The article cites several examples, including the renaming of military bases, barring a former intelligence director from a CIA event, and a sudden policy shift on Ukraine seemingly driven by a personal slight from Vladimir Putin. The author contends that this governance by emotion and grievance taints the executive branch and leads to chaotic, inconsistent decision-making. This culture of retribution, the article concludes, is a defining and destructive feature of the presidency.</p>
