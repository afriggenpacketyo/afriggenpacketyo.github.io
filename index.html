        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A man from Senegal who entered the U.S. illegally has been charged with assaulting federal officers and other detainees with scissors at an immigration facility in New York City. The Department of Homeland Security stated the individual was in the country due to "catch-and-release" policies and highlighted a significant increase in assaults against ICE officers. The agency has attributed the rise in violence to what it calls "lies and fake stories" from critics, including some politicians and media outlets, which they claim incite animosity towards law enforcement. The suspect faces one count of assaulting a U.S. officer with a dangerous weapon.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal fraught with political controversy. The approval followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit from Donald Trump and Skydance's commitment to eliminate DEI initiatives and add an ombudsman to address conservative bias concerns at CBS News. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have suggested the deal involved improper political influence, pointing to the timing of the settlement and the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." The merger places the media giant under the control of David Ellison, son of Trump ally Larry Ellison.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies are "underspending, not overspending" on artificial intelligence, framing the current technological race as a "winner-take-all" situation. He pointed to Alphabet's recent strong earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence that these investments are both necessary and justified to achieve market dominance. While acknowledging current shortcomings in AI chatbots, Cramer expressed confidence that the technology will improve, particularly with advanced chips from companies like Nvidia. He believes the company with the most accurate AI will ultimately secure a near-monopoly, yielding immense profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hunter Marquez, a 22-year-old transgender cadet, has had his dream of becoming an Air Force officer deferred due to the reinstatement of a ban on transgender military service. After graduating from the Air Force Academy with dual degrees, Marquez was unable to be commissioned as a second lieutenant alongside his peers. The policy, which argues that gender-affirming care is incompatible with service, is disputed by experts who state there is no evidence that transgender troops harm military readiness. Marquez has now joined a federal lawsuit challenging the ban, asserting that gender identity does not diminish one's ability to serve the country effectively.</p>

          <p>Thai and Cambodian forces clashed along their shared border, resulting in at least 12 deaths in Thailand, primarily civilians. The conflict, which involved artillery, rockets, and Thai airstrikes, was reportedly triggered by a landmine explosion that injured five Thai soldiers. Both nations have offered conflicting accounts of what initiated the fighting, with each accusing the other of aggression and violation of territorial integrity. The escalation marks a significant deterioration in relations, leading to the sealing of border crossings, diplomatic expulsions, and calls from the U.S. for an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>Intel's second-quarter revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, but the company's stock fell after new CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant spending cuts, particularly in its chip foundry division. Tan stated the company had "invested too much, too soon" and that future investments must make economic sense, canceling planned factory projects in Europe and slowing construction in Ohio. The company also reported a net loss of $2.9 billion for the quarter and confirmed it had completed the majority of its planned layoffs, which will reduce its workforce by 15%. These measures are part of a broader strategy to regain market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the formal nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a procedural move that allows her to continue serving in the position in an acting capacity. The action came after federal judges in New Jersey attempted to replace Habba with her deputy as her initial 120-day interim term was expiring, a move Attorney General Pam Bondi condemned as judicial overreach. By pulling the Senate nomination, the administration sidesteps a federal law that would have prevented her from serving as an acting officer while under formal consideration. The situation highlights a contentious struggle over executive appointment powers.</p>

The meeting follows a warning from the European nations that they will reimpose UN sanctions if Tehran does not demonstrate serious progress in curbing its nuclear activities and cooperating with the IAEA. These "snapback" sanctions are seen as the Europeans' primary leverage, as direct U.S.-Iran talks have stalled following military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Analysts believe a major breakthrough is unlikely, but the talks represent a crucial effort to de-escalate tensions and keep a path to diplomacy open.</p>

This move comes amid a worsening homelessness crisis and follows a Supreme Court ruling that weakened protections for unhoused people.

The judge, Maria Carroccia, stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable" and that the prosecution had not met its burden of proof. The case centered on whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, consented to subsequent sexual acts with the other four.

          <p>The FCC has officially approved Skydance Media's $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, concluding a tumultuous process marked by political pressure. The approval came after Paramount settled a lawsuit with President Trump for $16 million and Skydance committed to major changes at CBS, including canceling DEI programs. The deal, which places David and Larry Ellison in control, was approved by a 2-1 vote along party lines, with the commission's lone Democrat dissenting sharply, stating the "American public who will ultimately pay the price." The takeover is expected to be finalized in the coming days, ending the Redstone family's long era of control over the media conglomerate.</p>

          <p>U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has met with Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein, as the Trump administration faces mounting pressure to release more information about the case. Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered all questions honestly during the full-day meeting at a federal office in Florida, where she is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The meeting occurs amid renewed scrutiny of the Epstein investigation, fueled by the DOJ's recent announcement that it would not release more files, contrary to earlier promises. The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the DOJ for the files and Maxwell for a deposition.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is growing significantly, with AI-related job postings increasing at a much faster rate than the overall job market over the past 15 years. A report from the Brookings Institution shows these listings more than doubled in the last year alone, as more companies in manufacturing and other sectors integrate AI into their operations. These roles, which range from specialized AI engineers to software developers with AI knowledge, also tend to offer higher salaries. While still a small fraction of the total labor market, AI job growth is expanding beyond traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to permit the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants that it deems misaligned with its policy objectives. The grants in question, totaling roughly $783 million, are tied to research involving gender identity and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. A lower federal court had previously blocked the cancellations, ruling that the NIH engaged in "no reasoned decision-making." The administration is now making an emergency appeal to the high court, arguing that lower courts are improperly elevating their own policy judgments over those of the Executive Branch.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit claims these policies intentionally obstruct federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals to ICE. The move comes amid heightened rhetoric from federal officials, who have promised to "flood the zone" with immigration agents in sanctuary cities. The mayor's office responded that the laws are essential for public safety by ensuring all residents feel safe reporting crimes, but acknowledged that the City Council's laws may go too far.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would have stripped individuals of the ability to sue under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The case originated in North Dakota, where an appeals court uniquely ruled that only the U.S. Attorney General, not private citizens or groups, could bring such lawsuits. This emergency intervention preserves the status quo for now, allowing challenges against race-based voting discrimination to proceed. However, the victory for voting rights advocates may be short-lived, as the court is set to rehear a similar case from Louisiana that could ultimately lead to a nationwide restriction of the Act's enforcement powers.</p>

          <p>Six months into the new administration, federal education policy has undergone significant shifts, reflecting President Trump's vow to diminish the role of the Department of Education. Despite this, the administration has also actively wielded the department's power, most recently by withholding billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools. This action is part of a broader overhaul that has drastically altered the federal government's involvement in American education. The changes raise fundamental questions about the future of public schooling and the administration's impact on classrooms across the country.</p>

The yet-unnamed party, co-founded with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, will offer an alternative to what they describe as Labour's "control freaks" and the "dangerously divisive" politics of Reform UK. The new venture seeks to capitalize on energy from the left wing of British politics, focusing on issues like child poverty and corporate profits. A Labour Party source responded by noting that the electorate has already delivered its verdict on a Corbyn-led party twice.</p>

He argued that despite a strong economy, "desperate times call for desperate measures" and that a rate cut would save the nation money.
