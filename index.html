          <p>The European Commission confirmed that a plane carrying its president, Ursula von der Leyen, experienced GPS jamming while en route to Bulgaria. The aircraft landed safely, and Bulgarian authorities suspect the interference was deliberately carried out by Russia.

The event underscores the escalating electronic warfare tactics being attributed to Russia, impacting civilian and official travel.</p>

          <p>Seven months into his second term, President Trump claims his policies are designed to uplift the American worker, pointing to rising wages and low unemployment. However, many labor leaders, including the AFL-CIO President, argue it is the most hostile administration to workers in recent memory, citing widespread uncertainty. Key concerns include new immigration policies that have displaced long-term legal workers and fears that infrastructure projects from the previous administration will be defunded. The article also notes the mass departure of federal employees, creating further instability in government services.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce tighter regulations for family members of individuals granted asylum, including stricter English language requirements and proof of sufficient funds. The government aims to overhaul what it calls a "broken" asylum system and reduce reliance on housing migrants in hotels. These reforms also include a new fast-track appeals process and an update on a returns agreement with France. The Conservative opposition has criticized the proposed changes as a "tiny tweak," arguing for more drastic measures to address illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has announced the suspension of its "Voice of Freedom" propaganda radio broadcasts directed at North Korea. This move is the latest in a series of de-escalation efforts by President Lee Jae Myung's new administration to improve relations with the nuclear-armed North. The program, which has been on and off since 1962, broadcasted outside information and K-pop music into the heavily restricted country.

          <p>The head of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, visited Taiwan and referred to the democratic island as a "free country" with the "right to remain free," prompting a sharp response from Beijing. During the visit, Wicker emphasized the U.S. Congress's commitment to Taiwan's self-determination and enhanced military cooperation. China's Foreign Ministry condemned the visit and the senator's remarks as a violation of the "one-China" principle, reiterating its stance that Taiwan's future must be decided by the Chinese people.

          <p>Newcastle United has agreed to a £55 million deal to sign forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford, following the player's public request to leave the club. The deal, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons, comes as Newcastle seeks to strengthen its attack after selling Alexander Isak to Liverpool. Wissa, 28, accused Brentford of unfairly blocking his move despite receiving fair offers. The transfer marks a significant move for Newcastle, which is looking to fill the void left by its departing star striker.</p>

The decision was made after learning that Mueller is battling Parkinson's disease, which precludes him from appearing before Congress, as confirmed by his family. Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller, who served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013, as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files.

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever childcare support expansion has begun, offering working parents 30 hours of government-funded care for children aged nine months to four years. While the government claims the scheme will save parents thousands, many are facing long waiting lists and staff shortages at nurseries, limiting access. Some parents are taking extreme measures, such as scheduling C-sections before a term deadline to ensure earlier eligibility.

These detentions add to 23 other UN workers who have been held by the Houthis since 2021, severely hindering the delivery of critical humanitarian aid in the war-torn country.

          <p>Following President Trump's executive order to ban no-cash bail, a former Chicago police chief detective has spoken out against such policies, arguing they are a "disaster" for urban communities. The veteran officer, Eugene Roy, stated that criminals are exploiting the system, which allows violent offenders back on the streets with "no constraints," terrorizing victims and communities. The article highlights several cases where individuals released under Illinois's SAFE-T Act, which eliminated cash bail, allegedly went on to commit further violent crimes.

          <p>An article in The Guardian examines the growing debate over whether President Donald Trump's actions qualify him as a dictator. Despite Trump's denial, the piece cites his deployment of military vehicles in Washington, threats to prosecute political opponents, targeting of critical media outlets, and politicization of government agencies as behaviors atypical of a democratic leader. Political scientists interviewed suggest that while the U.S. has not consolidated into an outright dictatorship, it is collapsing into a form of authoritarianism. The analysis highlights Trump's "performative authoritarianism" as a tactic to appeal to a specific voter base.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that President Donald Trump, despite his "America First" rhetoric and criticism of "globalists," operates as a global leader who sees himself as central to solving international problems. The article points to his second-term focus on brokering peace deals, launching limited military interventions, and meddling in the internal politics of other nations as evidence of this tendency. This approach is described as a form of globalism stripped of liberal-democratic values, where U.S. power is used to serve his specific interests and priorities. This contrasts with traditional isolationism, suggesting a different, more transactional form of global engagement.</p>

This redevelopment is part of a broader trend of repurposing "dead malls" that have been unable to compete with online shopping and modern outdoor lifestyle centers. The rest of the former mall is being converted by UCLA into a major research facility, reflecting a shift in urban land use from retail to housing and institutional purposes.</p>

          <p>Press freedom in Ethiopia is under increasing pressure as the government has intensified its crackdown on the media, with a surge in the arbitrary detention of journalists in recent months. Although some have been released, rights groups like Reporters Without Borders describe the situation as "awful," with authorities weaponizing media and anti-terror laws against journalists. This represents a reversal of the initial optimism that followed Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's rise to power in 2018. With a general election scheduled for 2026, watchdogs fear the government is tightening its grip to control the public narrative.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district court judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was sought by advocacy groups who argued the children would be at risk of abuse and that the action violated laws protecting minors who arrive in the U.S. alone. The Trump administration and Guatemala's president claimed the flights were for family reunification, not deportation. The ruling highlights the ongoing legal and political battles over the administration's sweeping efforts to remove undocumented migrants from the country.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Strategic Concerns Restrain Trump from Imposing Harsher Sanctions on Russia</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite repeated threats to punish Russia over its continued war in Ukraine, President Trump has refrained from implementing severe new sanctions. According to analysts, this hesitation is strategic, driven by two main factors: Trump's desire to be seen as a peace-broker who can bring both sides to the negotiating table, and a fear of pushing Russia into a closer alliance with China. Washington officials are reportedly concerned that completely isolating Russia would strengthen China by giving it nearly unlimited access to Russian energy, military technology, and Arctic territories. This complex geopolitical calculation is currently overriding calls for a more punitive approach.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has expressed serious concern over President Trump's attempts to pressure the U.S. Federal Reserve, calling it a "very serious danger" for the global economy. Lagarde emphasized the critical importance of the central bank's independence, stating that if U.S. monetary policy were subject to political dictates, the worldwide economic effects could be very worrying. Her comments follow Trump's repeated attacks on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his threats to dismiss him. Lagarde did note, however, that U.S. law makes it very difficult for a president to fire a Fed governor without cause.</p>

          <p>The annual growth rate of UK house prices slowed to 2.1% in August, matching the lowest rate seen this year, according to data from lender Nationwide. This sluggish market activity comes as the government is reportedly considering a major overhaul of property taxes, such as stamp duty, in the upcoming budget. Economists suggest that the current tax system hinders mobility, while high prices relative to incomes continue to make homeownership challenging for many prospective buyers. Despite recent cuts in the Bank of England's interest rates, high mortgage costs remain a significant barrier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the Scottish government-owned train operator, has permanently eliminated peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during weekday rush hours. The move, which follows a previous pilot scheme, is expected to result in significant savings for commuters, with some ticket prices falling by nearly 50%. The policy aims to encourage more people to switch from cars to trains, providing environmental benefits and financial relief for travelers. The annual cost of the subsidy, estimated at £40-45 million, will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger numbers.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created the world's first elastic, rubber-band-like material capable of efficiently converting body heat into electricity. This breakthrough in thermoelectric conversion could pave the way for self-charging wearable devices, such as smartwatches, eliminating the need for bulky batteries. The material harnesses the temperature difference between the human body (around 37°C) and the surrounding air to generate a constant power supply. According to the researchers' paper in *Nature*, this is the first high-performance thermoelectric material to achieve true elasticity, not just flexibility.</p>

However, the policies face challenges, including inconsistent enforcement by teachers and pushback from some students and parents who worry about being unable to contact their children. Many schools are using locked pouches like Yondr to enforce the bans, though this adds a significant cost for districts.</p>
