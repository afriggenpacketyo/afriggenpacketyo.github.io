          <h2>Putin Proposes Direct Talks with Ukraine Amidst Calls for Cease-fire</h2>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested holding direct talks with Ukraine as early as May 15 to address the conflict's root causes and establish a lasting peace. This proposal follows a visit from European leaders, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, who urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day cease-fire. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially responded cautiously, warning against applying pressure on Moscow. Putin's call for direct talks signals a potential shift in diplomatic engagement, though the conditions and participants remain unspecified, and the conflict remains ongoing as of this article.</p>

          <p>Farmer David Thornley is pursuing legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe contaminated Diseworth Brook, resulting in the loss of pedigree lambs in 2022. Thornley claims that 25 of his ewes lost their lambs after drinking from the polluted brook, with environmental studies indicating that de-icing chemicals from airport runways can negatively impact water quality. While the airport acknowledges a small leak into the brook, they deny any connection between the discharge and the bacterial pollution. The Environment Agency is investigating the matter.</p>

          <p>Faced with the threat of new sanctions, President Vladimir V. Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in the coming days. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, on their first joint visit to Ukraine, said on Saturday that Russia would face ‚Äúnew and massive‚Äù sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Vladimir V. Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire.

          <p>Bangladesh's interim government has prohibited all activities of the Awami League, the political party of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, until a special tribunal concludes a trial regarding deaths during anti-government protests in 2024. The ban, which includes cyberspace, is intended to protect plaintiffs and witnesses, according to law advisor Asif Nazrul. This decision follows protests in Dhaka calling for the ban, while the Awami League has rejected the action as illegitimate. The UN's human rights office estimates that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the Hasina administration's response to the protests, and Hasina herself has been in exile in India since August 2024.</p>

          <p>Talks between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding tariffs that threaten the global economy concluded after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, according to CBS News. President Trump announced that "great progress" was made and that the two countries negotiated a "total reset" in a friendly but constructive manner. The initial discussions likely focused on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, as the high tariffs imposed by both countries are unsustainable. The talks aim to scale back the tariffs and relieve financial markets and companies dependent on U.S.-China trade.</p>

          <p>China's strategy in the trade war with the US involves imposing export controls on rare earth elements, essential for manufacturing military equipment and space technology. As the world's largest producer and consumer of these elements, China's restrictions, enacted in response to US tariffs, are causing anxiety within the US defense industry. The export controls include seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, potentially disrupting the supply chain for critical components used in jet engines, radar, and avionics.</p>
