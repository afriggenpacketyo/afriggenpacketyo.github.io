          <p>Hunter Kozak, the student who asked the final question before conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot, recounted the experience. Kozak stated he did not fear for his own life but described the event at Utah Valley University as intensely "visceral," immediately recognizing it as a potential assassination attempt. He has since been questioned by the FBI after proactively contacting law enforcement to provide his account and video footage recorded by his wife. Kozak, a progressive content creator, expressed frustration with the conspiracy theories that have emerged following the shooting.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy showed no growth in July, a figure that aligned with economists' expectations following a 0.4% expansion in June. According to the Office for National Statistics, this stagnation was driven by the largest contraction in manufacturing output in a year, which offset growth in the service sector. The data puts pressure on the government to stimulate economic growth ahead of the upcoming Budget. Despite the flat monthly figure, the economy expanded by 0.2% over the three-month period ending in July, suggesting some underlying resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House of Lords has begun its scrutiny of a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, with members reminded that their role is to review, not block, the legislation. The Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which was passed by the House of Commons with a majority of 23, has prompted extensive debate among peers. Proponents like Lord Charlie Falconer argue the current law is confused and lacks compassion, while opponents, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, raised concerns about safeguards and the risk of pressuring vulnerable individuals to end their lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can temporarily block Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood while legal challenges proceed. This decision pauses an earlier ruling by a federal judge that had required the government to continue reimbursements. The case stems from a provision in a Trump-era bill aimed at defunding abortion providers for one year, even for non-abortion services like contraception and STD testing. Planned Parenthood argues this will restrict access to essential healthcare for over a million patients and potentially force the closure of up to 200 health centers.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government is facing significant internal anger from its own MPs regarding the appointment and subsequent firing of Peter Mandelson as the ambassador to the US. Mandelson was dismissed after new information emerged about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, specifically emails showing support after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea. The prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, is facing blame for the appointment, which critics call a "shambles" and a "serious misjudgement." The chaotic situation has added to a difficult period for the government, following another high-profile resignation the previous week.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, this article argues that Democrats are contemplating a move that could dismantle a key institutional guardrail. Some progressives are pushing to use the filibuster to force a government shutdown to enact new restrictions on President Trump's authority. However, the author contends this strategy could backfire, provoking Senate Republicans to eliminate the legislative filibuster entirely. This would grant Trump and the GOP majority far more power to pass laws, potentially enabling the kind of political crackdown some on the right have called for following the shooting.</p>

          <p>A woman named Hakyung Lee, currently on trial in New Zealand, has admitted to killing her two young children, whose bodies were discovered in suitcases four years after their deaths. Prosecutors stated she accepted responsibility for giving her children, aged 6 and 8, a fatal dose of an antidepressant in 2018. However, her defense is arguing for a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming she was in a deep depression following her husband's death. The children's remains were found by a family who had purchased the contents of an abandoned storage locker at an auction.</p>

Becker argues that winning Wimbledon at age 17 changed his life overnight, leading him to trust others to manage his finances, which ultimately resulted in the financial misconduct that led to his imprisonment. The book provides a look into the harsh realities of prison life while portraying Becker as a victim of the British justice system and his own fame.

          <p>Russia's recent drone incursion into Polish airspace is being widely interpreted by geopolitical analysts as a "salami-slicing" strategy. This tactic involves a series of small, incremental provocations designed to test an adversary's resolve without triggering a major military response. Experts suggest Russian President Vladimir Putin has frequently used this method to probe NATO's defenses, citing previous airspace violations and border expansions. Analysts warn that without a robust political and military response from the West, these probing actions are likely to become more aggressive, as they perceive NATO's desire to avoid direct conflict.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision, with a concurring opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, has granted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) wider authority to detain and question individuals based on factors like ethnic appearance or speaking a foreign language.

          <p>California's incarcerated firefighters, who currently earn as little as $5.80 per day, could soon see a substantial pay increase after state lawmakers unanimously approved a new bill. The legislation would raise their pay to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour when they are assigned to an active fire. Proponents argue the measure recognizes the life-threatening work these individuals perform and will help them build savings or pay restitution. The state's inmate fire crews, who perform crucial tasks like clearing brush and digging containment lines, often constitute a significant portion of the workforce battling California's wildfires.</p>

          <p>A recent poll showing California Governor Gavin Newsom defeating Donald Trump in a hypothetical 2028 presidential matchup highlights how American politics remains dominated by Trump's influence. This article argues that while the poll might seem like good news for Democrats, it also normalizes the unconstitutional idea of Trump seeking a third term. The author suggests that in the current political climate, the ability to defeat Trump has become the primary metric for Democratic viability. Newsom's rise in such polls reflects the success of his strategy to position himself as a fighter, which resonates with Democratic voters seeking an antidote to Trumpism.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded that a deadly 2023 midair collision involving two firefighting helicopters in Riverside County was caused by poor judgment and procedural violations by one of the crews. The crash, which killed two Cal Fire firefighters and a contract pilot, occurred when a large Skycrane helicopter made a sudden, aggressive descent without proper communication, striking a smaller Bell helicopter. Investigators found that the Skycrane crew failed to inform the aerial supervisor they could not comply with an altitude clearance and did not announce their non-standard maneuver, leading to the fatal impact.</p>

          <p>A number of retired NFL and UFC athletes are seeking treatment for traumatic brain injuries (TBI) with ibogaine, a psychedelic substance derived from a West African shrub. Despite being a Schedule 1 drug in the U.S., these athletes travel to clinics in Mexico, reporting life-changing results in reducing depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts associated with TBI. An observational Stanford study on military veterans showed ibogaine significantly reduced PTSD and depression symptoms, suggesting it may stimulate brain healing. While experts urge caution and call for more rigorous clinical trials, there is growing momentum for research into its therapeutic potential.</p>

Tusk stated, "We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But it wasn't. And we know it." This sentiment was echoed by other Polish and European leaders, who view the incident as a deliberate test of NATO's defenses and resolve. The incursion involved 19 Russian drones entering Polish airspace, prompting the scrambling of NATO fighter jets for the first time in response to such an event.</p>

Afterward, the profit share will shift dramatically to 90% for the United States and 10% for Japan.
