          <p>Federal immigration agents clashed with protesters during a raid on what was described as a marijuana facility in Southern California. The Department of Homeland Security executed a warrant, leading to confrontations where agents used crowd control measures and detained at least one person. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, condemned the operation as an "inhumane" tactic intended to create fear, part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement by the Trump administration in the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1st. President Trump cited retaliatory tariffs from Canada as the reason and linked the measure to stopping the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This new tariff is separate from existing sectoral duties and comes with a threat of further increases if Canada continues its retaliatory measures, escalating trade tensions.

          <p>With the UK experiencing its third heatwave of the year, this article examines whether these extreme weather events are "just summer" or a direct consequence of climate change. The piece notes that 2025 has already been a record-breaking year for warmth and that global temperature rise disproportionately increases the intensity of heatwaves. Scientists warn that what was once a rare event, like the 1976 heatwave, is becoming a more regular feature of British summers.</p>

          <p>A surgeon, Marc Lamah, who was banned from a private healthcare company due to patient safety concerns, is reportedly still operating on patients within the UK's National Health Service. Nuffield Health withdrew Lamah's practicing privileges after an investigation found his conduct did not meet their standards, yet the NHS trust employing him states its own audit found his outcomes to be within the expected range. The case has been highlighted by a former patient who claims she suffered severe complications after an NHS operation he performed.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea's fertility clinics are experiencing a boom in demand even as the nation grapples with the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. This trend is attributed to a generational shift where more people are delaying parenthood due to social and financial pressures, then turning to medical technology to start families later in life.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel following an internal investigation into the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. A new report from the agency acknowledged the incident, where a gunman fired at Trump, as an "operational failure" and outlined reforms to prevent future lapses. The suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days without pay, are part of the agency's response to intense scrutiny and criticism over the security breach.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals an alarming trend: the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. This means that even small increases in average global temperature can lead to significantly longer and more dangerous periods of extreme heat. The findings underscore the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies to protect people, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in tropical regions that will be most severely affected.</p>

          <p>A new report from the United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) warns that significant funding cuts, particularly from the United States, are threatening to unravel decades of progress in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The Trump administration's halt of most funding for the PEPFAR program has left a major gap, potentially leading to millions of new infections and deaths. Health officials in highly affected countries like South Africa are calling the cuts a "wake-up call" that highlights the danger of depending on a single donor.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing long-standing policy by excluding undocumented children from Head Start, the federal early childhood education program for low-income families. The change is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for immigrants and reclassifies Head Start and other programs as "federal public benefits" to restrict access. Critics argue the move will create fear and confusion among all immigrant families and deny vulnerable children access to crucial educational and nutritional support.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil is reportedly driven by political anger rather than purely economic concerns. Sources indicate the move is a reaction to Brazil's role in the BRICS coalition of emerging economies, which is seen as challenging U.S. economic dominance, and President Trump's opposition to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. This use of tariffs to address non-trade issues represents a significant escalation of the administration's aggressive trade agenda. (not investment advice)</p>
