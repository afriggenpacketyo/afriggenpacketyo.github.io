            <p>Two Pentagon political appointees, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, were fired after being suspended earlier in the week due to an investigation into unauthorized disclosures. Joe Kasper, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, initiated the probe following a memo outlining the need for a complete record of leaks, potentially involving polygraph tests. Caldwell, Selnick, and another official, Colin Carroll, expressed disappointment and denied the allegations, emphasizing their commitment to information security during their service. The investigation's scope remains unclear, but it extends beyond a single story, including the denial of Elon Musk's classified briefing on war plans with China.</p>

            <p>Aditya Wahyu Harsono, an Indonesian student and father of a special needs child, was detained by ICE after his student visa was secretly revoked without notice. His attorney argues that the revocation, based on a minor graffiti conviction, is unjust and that DHS is instilling fear through weaponizing the immigration system. Harsono, married to a US citizen with a pending green-card application, was arrested at his workplace after hospital staff were instructed to stage a fake meeting. He is also a supporter of humanitarian relief for Gaza, raising concerns about potential targeting based on his views.</p>

            <p>A motorized wooden boat carrying approximately 500 passengers caught fire and capsized in the Congo River, resulting in at least 148 deaths, including women and children. The boat, HB Kongolo, was traveling from Matankumu to Bolomba when the fire started, reportedly due to a woman cooking onboard. Boating accidents are common in Congo due to old, overloaded vessels being the primary mode of transport between villages. Hundreds are still missing, and survivors are receiving medical care at local hospitals.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary stay on the deportations of Venezuelans held in a Texas detention center under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, after an emergency appeal by the ACLU.
