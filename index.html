        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is cutting security funding for Washington D.C. by $20 million, a 44% year-over-year reduction, despite the president's call for an increased federal law enforcement presence to combat crime. The Department of Homeland Security stated the cuts, which also affect other major cities, align with a shift in the threat landscape from large-scale attacks to smaller assaults. This decision comes as D.C. has seen a significant drop in violent crime, and as President Trump threatens federal control if the city doesn't manage its crime situation.</p>

          <p>India is significantly upgrading its key road access to the disputed Galwan Valley, the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie Road, to support the movement of tanks and missile trucks. An alternative 130km route is also nearing completion, aimed at reducing reliance on the primary road which is exposed to Chinese surveillance. This infrastructure development is intended to facilitate faster troop deployment in the event of a confrontation with China.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Biden administration bears responsibility for the famine in Gaza, predating the current Trump administration's involvement. The author contends that despite repeated warnings from the UN and aid groups about imminent starvation as early as December 2023, the Biden White House failed to use its leverage to pressure Israel. The piece claims that Biden's administration undermined humanitarian efforts and circumvented US laws that restrict arms shipments to allies obstructing aid. The author concludes that this complicity is a significant stain on Biden's presidential legacy, as he missed multiple opportunities to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece expresses alarm over calls for the FBI to assist Texas Republicans in locating Democratic state lawmakers who have fled the state to block a partisan redistricting plan. The author argues that any FBI involvement would be a lawless expansion of its authority, as its jurisdiction is limited to federal crimes, not enforcing civil warrants for a state legislature. The article warns that using the FBI as a political tool for the party in power would be a dangerous step toward a police state. It emphasizes that the FBI's role is to be a neutral law-enforcement agency, not an arm of a political party.</p>

          <p>The Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, once a vibrant center of Palestinian identity, is now a wasteland after 14 years of Syrian civil war. Volunteer engineers are assessing the catastrophic damage, with about 40% of the camp destroyed and essential services nonexistent, hindering the return of its displaced population. Residents who have returned face immense challenges, rebuilding their homes amid rubble and uncertainty about the new Syrian government's stance on the Palestinian cause. The destruction has profoundly altered the community, leaving many to question if the camp will ever regain its former status as a "mini-Palestine."</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Vice President JD Vance's recent criticism of partisan gerrymandering in California is hypocritical, given the Republican party's history of using the same tactics, particularly in Texas. The author points out that while Vance decries California's representation imbalance, Texas Republicans have drawn maps that heavily favor their party, despite significant population growth among people of color. The article also discusses how Democratic gerrymandering in Illinois inadvertently removed a moderate Republican, Adam Kinzinger, who later became a key opponent of Donald Trump. The author concludes that gerrymandering ultimately harms democracy by eliminating moderate voices.</p>

          <p>SpaceX plans to increase its rocket launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base to nearly 100 per year, a significant jump from its current schedule. This proposal faces strong opposition from the California Coastal Commission, which cites concerns over environmental impacts on wildlife and disruptive sonic booms for residents. The dispute has escalated into a legal battle, with SpaceX suing the commission and military officials arguing the launches are a matter of national security, exempting them from state oversight. The commission maintains that since most launches are for SpaceX's commercial Starlink network, they should be subject to state regulation.</p>

          <p>The 12,000-year-old archaeological site of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey is capturing public imagination, but also attracting conspiracy theories popularized by figures like Graham Hancock and podcaster Joe Rogan. These theories suggest a "lost civilization" built the site and accuse archaeologists of hiding discoveries, fueling public suspicion. Lead archaeologist Lee Clare refutes these claims, explaining that the slow excavation process is necessary to protect the site for future research, not to conceal information. The true purpose of the ancient ceremonial hub remains a mystery, representing one of humanity's earliest examples of complex storytelling.</p>

          <p>As catastrophic hunger affects populations in conflict zones like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are highlighting the dangers of "refeeding syndrome." This potentially fatal condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly, causing a rapid, dangerous shift in electrolytes that can lead to organ failure. Proper treatment requires a slow, managed reintroduction of nutrients, often using specially formulated therapeutic foods like Plumpy'Nut. Aid organizations stress that preventing this syndrome is nearly impossible without safe and consistent access to these regions, which requires international pressure on the governments controlling access.</p>

          <p>With the Trump administration's new tariffs taking effect, the U.S. now has its highest average tariff rate since 1933, raising questions about the economic impact. Economists predict that the costs will be shared among foreign exporters, U.S. companies, and consumers, leading to higher prices on many goods. While overall inflation is expected to rise, it is not projected to reach the highs of 2022, though it may negatively affect consumer sentiment. The tariffs are also expected to slow the job market and overall economic growth, but most forecasters do not currently predict a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Guests should communicate their plans, be self-sufficient with transportation, and avoid overstaying their welcome.

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated that U.S. military forces will not be permitted to operate in Mexico, following reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while the two countries cooperate on security, a U.S. military "invasion" is "absolutely ruled out." The reported U.S. directive follows an executive order designating several Mexican cartels as terrorist entities. This development comes amid ongoing collaboration between the U.S. and Mexico to curb illegal drug and migrant flows across the border.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted two raids targeting day laborers outside a Home Depot in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, detaining at least 10 people. Immigrant advocacy groups argue these actions violate a recent court order that prohibits federal agents from using racial profiling to conduct indiscriminate arrests without reasonable suspicion. The raids, including a recent "Trojan Horse" style operation in Westlake, have intensified concerns that immigration enforcement is defying the court's temporary restraining order. City officials are investigating the legality of the operations, while a U.S. Border Patrol chief defended the actions as lawful and intelligence-based.</p>

He was also part of the Apollo 8 crew, the first mission to orbit the Moon, making him the first person to travel to the Moon twice without ever landing on it. His life and the Apollo 13 story were famously immortalized in the 1995 film starring Tom Hanks.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has unexpectedly ended his attempt to forge a career in the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to rugby union.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU has sanctioned an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude oil, but experts believe this will have less impact on EU-India trade relations than the threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. This pressure from the U.S. may paradoxically strengthen India's desire to finalize a free trade agreement with the EU, seeking more predictable economic partners. The EU has taken a more measured approach in trade negotiations, particularly regarding India's sensitive agricultural sector. This dynamic could benefit the EU-India relationship and potentially align with Western interests if it leads India to reduce its reliance on Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>
