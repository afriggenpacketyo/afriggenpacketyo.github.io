          <p>United Launch Alliance delayed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to an elevated purge temperature within the Atlas V rocket's booster engine, with only 30 minutes remaining in the countdown. ULA CEO Tory Bruno announced the scrub on Bluesky, stating the issue with a GN2 purge line couldn't be resolved within the count, necessitating a temporary halt. The launch from Florida's Space Coast was initially scheduled for the previous Friday but was rescheduled to Monday due to inclement weather. A new launch date will be announced later after the issue is sorted out. Optimism is tempered by the technical setback, but the project's overall goals remain intact.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Iran would "like to talk" about de-escalating the Israel-Iran conflict, amidst ongoing missile exchanges between the two countries. Trump reiterated that Iran had 60 days to strike a new nuclear deal, and that Iran is "not winning this war" and should talk immediately. According to the Wall Street Journal, Iran has been sending messages to Israel and the U.S. through Arab intermediaries, signaling openness to negotiations if the U.S. doesn't join Israel's attacks. Trump affirmed the U.S.'s support for Israel, without specifying material support being provided. Given the volatile situation, there's cautious optimism regarding potential de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Following the murder of Minnesota state assemblywoman Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the wounding of state senator John Hoffman and his wife, members of Congress are calling for increased security measures. Senators are scheduled to be briefed by law enforcement regarding safety concerns. House Republicans held a tense conference call with the House sergeant at arms and U.S. Capitol Police, expressing concerns about safety in their home districts and requesting more protection. Vance Boelter faces federal charges in connection to the shootings, which are believed to be politically motivated, while Michigan Democratic Rep.

          <p>A report by Baroness Louise Casey into group-based sexual exploitation has highlighted failures at all levels in addressing the issue, noting that the children being abused were too often blamed instead of helped. The report emphasizes the lack of action by authorities over the years, particularly regarding the ethnicity of perpetrators. The government has accepted the recommendation for better data collection on the ethnicity of grooming gang suspects and has promised research into the factors driving exploitation. The hope is that this report will lead to meaningful change and not be quietly shelved like previous reports.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his goal to expand deportations in major cities, particularly those run by Democrats, amidst nationwide protests against his administration's immigration raids. Trump stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. He accused Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the welfare state, despite noncitizens not being able to vote in federal or state elections. Trump's determination on deportations follows his earlier shift on undocumented immigrants working in farming and hospitality industries.</p>

The report noted disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation in certain police forces. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper apologized to victims and announced a national inquiry into grooming gangs, with recommendations including mandatory data collection on ethnicity and nationality. The report concludes that ignorance and fear of appearing racist have led to organizations turning a blind eye to abuse.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares rose following President Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, subject to a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president "total control" over key decisions, such as relocating headquarters, moving the company outside the U.S., renaming U.S. Steel, transferring production or jobs abroad, and closing or idling plants. U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Lobbyist Claims Against New York Anti-Plastic Bill Criticized as 'Misleading'</h2>

          <p>The oil and petrochemical lobby is attempting to thwart a New York state proposal to reduce plastic waste by arguing it will disproportionately harm people of color, despite evidence that plastic production poses health risks to Black and brown communities. The bill aims to reduce plastic packaging by 30% in 12 years, boost recycling, and phase out toxic compounds. Lobbyists are targeting the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian American legislative caucus, claiming the bill will raise food prices, but advocates argue this is a racist tactic. Opponents point to a York University study suggesting price increases, but bill advocates cite reports indicating minimal price impact.</p>
