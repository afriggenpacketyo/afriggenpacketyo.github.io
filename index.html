            <p>As the US and China engage in a trade war, China is contemplating requiring bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi, which could significantly strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. This strategy would compel the US to purchase Chinese currency on a large scale, increasing demand and driving up the renminbi's value. The move aims to strategically counter the Trump administration's tariff policies and signal China's strong economic fundamentals to global investors, potentially increasing capital inflows to China and outflows from the US.

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of creating a false impression of honoring an Easter ceasefire, citing continued attacks despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a temporary truce. Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling, assaults, and drone strikes following Putin's declaration. He suggested Putin may not have full control over his army or that Russia is merely seeking favorable PR coverage. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days, emphasizing they would act based on the situation on the ground.</p>

            <p>A former member of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill commission warns that the Trump administration's cuts to science, environmental, and safety agencies, along with the rollback of environmental regulations, are setting the stage for a new environmental disaster. These actions are seen as a rejection of lessons learned from past crises, such as the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon spills, and a dangerous gamble. The weakening of offshore drilling safety measures, closure of regional offices responsible for oil spill response, and cuts to science funding amplify the risk of future catastrophes.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University, including freezing grants and demanding control over hiring and curriculum, are seen as part of a broader, decades-long conservative assault on academia. Experts argue this is an attempt to undermine and control higher education, resembling authoritarian tactics to suppress independent thought and dissent. Harvard's president refused to comply with demands to audit viewpoint diversity and eliminate DEI programs, citing governmental overreach on academic independence. The move is compared to McCarthyism and criticized as an effort to intimidate civic society organizations.</p>

            <p>Chris Whipple, previously a supportive biographer of Joe Biden, has released a new book, "Uncharted," which sharply criticizes Biden's mental and physical decline leading up to his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race. Whipple's earlier work, "The Fight of His Life," portrayed Biden as mentally sharp, but the new book depicts a president out of touch, exhausted, and struggling with debate preparation. The book also examines the failed campaign of Kamala Harris and features insights from Trump's campaign staff, painting a bleak picture of the Democratic party's leadership.</p>

            <p>This article draws parallels between Adolf Hitler's economic policies in the 1930s, particularly his use of tariffs, and modern trade wars. It details how Hitler, shortly after taking office, implemented tariffs to protect German industries and farmers, despite warnings of potential economic harm and retaliation. The article highlights the initial market rally followed by uncertainty and economic strain due to these policies, drawing parallels to contemporary trade disputes and emphasizing the potential for self-inflicted damage and international tensions. This historical context serves as a cautionary tale regarding the complexities and potential pitfalls of protectionist trade measures.</p>

            <p>A new report indicates that abortion travel in the US has doubled since 2020, with over 155,000 people crossing state lines for abortions in 2024. This increase is attributed to state-level abortion bans following the overturning of Roe v Wade. The Guttmacher Institute report highlights a deep geographical divide, with states like Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico becoming major hubs for abortion access. The report's release coincides with the Trump administration dismantling the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports, raising concerns about tracking public health outcomes.</p>

            <p>Carole Cadwalladr, reflecting on her experience being sued for a TED Talk, warns that technology is now politics and that a "broligarchy" of Silicon Valley and autocracy poses a threat to democracy. Speaking at TED again, she criticized Silicon Valley leaders for collaborating with a regime of fear and cruelty. She emphasizes the importance of rebuilding our information system and taking steps to protect ourselves from surveillance and data harvesting. Cadwalladr criticizes the British government's naivety in seeking to weaken copyright laws for AI companies.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is experiencing the worst economic approval numbers of his presidency, according to a recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey. The survey indicates broad discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending. Despite solid support from his Republican base, Democrats and independents are increasingly negative about the economy under Trump, and key groups like blue-collar workers show growing disapproval. The survey also reveals rising pessimism about the stock market and concerns about a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>
