The USGS reported that the volcano is in a unique phase, with dual lava fountains and inflationary tilt preceding the fountaining.

          <p>Tech conferences are increasing security measures to quell employee protests and address rising political tensions. Recent events at Microsoft's Build and Google I/O saw protesters interrupting keynotes, leading to heightened security presence and stricter rules. The increase in security reflects concerns over AI companies' work with governments and the potential for internal dissent. Companies are implementing measures such as undercover guards and stricter email policies to maintain control and safety.</p>

          <h2>A Critique of Summer: Overrated Season of Heat and Boredom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author argues that summer is an overrated season, challenging the popular image of beaches and vacations. They cite extreme heat, cognitive impairment, and the lack of significant events as reasons for their dislike. The author contends that summer is boring, filled with indistinguishable days, and that many people experience FOMO. Instead, the author prefers autumn and its holidays, or, at the very least, not being both hot and bored simultaneously.</p>
