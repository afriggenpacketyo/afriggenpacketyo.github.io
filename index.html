          <p>A driver in Wilmington, North Carolina, has been charged with felony DWI after crashing into a veterinary clinic, which ruptured a gas line and caused a major explosion. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, resulted in injuries to three firefighters who were searching the building to ensure it was empty. One firefighter sustained severe burns, while the other two suffered non-life-threatening injuries; no civilians were inside at the time of the blast. The driver, who initially fled the scene, was later located and arrested by police.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following high-level meetings, discussions are underway regarding the specific nature of "security guarantees" for Ukraine as part of a potential peace agreement with Russia. While Ukraine's primary goal of NATO membership has been ruled out for the near future, a 'Coalition of the Willing' is exploring alternatives. These options range from policing Ukraine's airspace and maritime routes in the Black Sea to providing long-term military training, intelligence, and weapons supplies. A key challenge remains in creating guarantees strong enough to deter future Russian aggression without being so provocative that Moscow rejects them entirely.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a future meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to advance peace negotiations. President Trump, who spoke with both leaders separately, indicated he wants them to meet first before potentially joining a trilateral summit to finalize a deal. This development follows Trump's recent diplomatic push to end the war, although Russian officials have publicly stated that any such high-level summit must be prepared with extreme care. The direct confirmation from the White House marks a significant step in the ongoing diplomatic process.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of betraying Israel, escalating a diplomatic dispute between the two nations. The sharp criticism follows Australia's decision to bar a far-right Israeli politician from entering the country and its recent announcement that it would join other Western nations in recognizing a Palestinian state. In response to the politician's visa cancellation, Israel revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority. The feud reflects growing international pressure on Israel regarding its policies and the ongoing conflict.</p>

This strategy mirrors Buffett's past actions of accumulating cash before major downturns like the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com crash, suggesting he may be waiting for lower prices to reinvest.

          <p>A tragic bus crash in western Afghanistan has resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people, primarily Afghan nationals who had recently been deported from Iran. The bus was traveling toward Kabul when it collided with a motorcycle and then a fuel truck, causing the vehicle to burst into flames. This incident highlights the perilous journey faced by many Afghans returning from neighboring countries, as authorities in Iran and Pakistan have increased pressure on migrants to leave. According to the UN, over 1.2 million Afghans have returned from these two countries this year alone.</p>

However, legal experts widely agree that the president does not have the authority to dictate how states conduct their elections. The U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections, with a secondary role for Congress, but no specified role for the executive branch. Despite this, Trump has asserted that states act as an "agent" for the federal government in this matter.</p>

          <p>Actor Callum Kerr has publicly requested that friends of his late mother, Dawn Searle, refrain from attending the funeral of his stepfather, Andrew Searle. In February, the couple was found dead at their home in France in what authorities have described as a murder-suicide, with evidence suggesting Andrew Searle was responsible for his wife's death before taking his own life. In a statement, Kerr said it would be inappropriate for his mother's memory to be associated with a service honoring the man believed to be responsible for her death, asking for privacy as his family continues to grieve.</p>

          <p>A High Court ruling that temporarily prevents the UK Home Office from housing asylum seekers at a hotel in Epping is creating significant practical and political problems for the government. The decision forces the government to find alternative accommodations quickly and could set a precedent for other local councils to launch similar legal challenges. The ruling has been praised by opposition figures and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, putting a spotlight on the government's immigration policies. The Home Office has expressed concern that the judgment could impact its ability to house asylum seekers nationwide.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews in Oregon are engaged in a delicate operation to save the Doerner Fir, one of the world's tallest non-redwood trees, after it caught fire. The 450-year-old, 325-foot-tall Douglas fir was ignited last week, and crews are using helicopters to douse the flames, as falling debris makes it too dangerous to send climbers up the tree. A hot spot remains high up in the trunk, and firefighters have established a containment line on the ground to prevent the fire's spread. The cause of the blaze is currently under investigation, and the surrounding area has been closed to the public.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are being sued in separate class-action lawsuits for allegedly deceiving passengers by selling seats designated as "window" seats that are actually next to a solid wall. The complaints argue that the airlines fail to disclose the lack of a window during booking, unlike some competitors, even while charging extra for the seat selection. Passengers seek window seats for various reasons, including to alleviate motion sickness or fear of flying. The lawsuits seek millions in damages, claiming customers would not have paid a premium for these seats had they known they were windowless.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, has been federally charged for allegedly creating and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." Prosecutors claim the network, comprised of malware-infected devices like routers and DVRs, was used to conduct large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for hire since at least 2021. The botnet, described as one of the most sophisticated in existence, allegedly targeted victims in over 80 countries, including a U.S. government network. Law enforcement officials disabled the botnet after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home earlier this month.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly expanded its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum to include 407 new product categories, a move that broadens the impact of its trade policy. Effective this week, the tariffs now apply to a wide range of derivative products, such as machinery, construction materials, and fire extinguishers that contain or are made with steel or aluminum. The Commerce Department stated the expansion is intended to shut down avenues for tariff circumvention and support American industries.

          <p>A faction within the Democratic Party is promoting a vision of "abundance liberalism," which advocates for streamlining bureaucracy to build more housing, clean energy, and infrastructure. This ideology is presented as a positive alternative to the party's recent reliance on anti-Trump messaging. However, the article suggests this agenda faces significant political hurdles, particularly from within the party's own base in affluent suburban areas. These communities often resist new development, such as affordable housing projects, creating a conflict between the progressive vision of abundance and the local politics of established Democratic voters.</p>

While progress was made in discussing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and arranging a direct meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, tangible breakthroughs remain elusive. Key challenges include uncertainty over whether Putin genuinely desires an end to the conflict while his forces are advancing, and concerns among allies about Trump's mercurial negotiating style. The president has staked his legacy on being a peacemaker, but the path forward is fraught with complexities.</p>
