          <p>A U.S. nuclear weapons expert has released satellite images suggesting a new uranium enrichment facility is under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, posted the image online, which was taken in April. The IAEA is also monitoring the construction of this new structure, which has similar features to an existing uranium enrichment plant in Kangson near Pyongyang. The facility's central hall is approximately 95 meters long and 24 meters wide, potentially housing centrifuges, and is surrounded by office and support spaces.</p>

The State Department has advised non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq due to heightened regional tensions, while the Pentagon has authorized military family members to voluntarily depart from locations throughout the Middle East. Despite these tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy plans to meet with Iranian officials for further nuclear program talks.

          <p>China is intensifying efforts to build its artificial intelligence ecosystem as U.S. export controls limit access to advanced semiconductors. Beijing is investing heavily in domestic alternatives like Huawei, aiming to bridge gaps in the semiconductor value chain from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips. While progress has been made, significant challenges remain in catching up to industry leaders like Nvidia, particularly in AI chip fabrication and access to advanced chip equipment. Despite these hurdles, China's advancements in AI chip design, especially by Huawei, demonstrate considerable progress in developing competitive alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 documented a mysterious new star, later identified as a nova, providing unprecedented details of the event. The record, recently rediscovered, confirms that the phenomenon was a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The details, including the starâ€™s size and brightness, have helped modern astronomers narrow down the starâ€™s possible position. The discovery was reported by researchers from China, Germany, and Chile in The Astronomical Journal.</p>
