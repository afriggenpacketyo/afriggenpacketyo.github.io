            <p>Amazon postponed the launch of its first two Kuiper internet satellites due to adverse weather at Cape Canaveral. The United Launch Alliance cited cumulus clouds and high winds as the reason for halting the launch, which was intended to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. Amazon is under pressure to meet an FCC deadline to deploy half of its satellite constellation by July 2026. Despite the delay, Amazon is preparing for its next launch on another ULA Atlas V rocket, aiming to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations, and governments.</p>

            <p>President Trump is intensifying the trade war with China by significantly increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%. This move aims to reshape global trade, challenging China's role as the world's factory. Trump's actions reflect his long-standing belief that China's economic rise has harmed the American economy. The future depends on whether China will negotiate and make concessions on its export-driven economic model, and whether the U.S. truly believes in free trade or prioritizes protectionism.</p>

While U.S. numbers are lower than some European countries, they are higher than others, and concerns remain about underreporting and the severity of the outbreak in Texas.
