          <p>Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, announced his plan to give away the vast majority of his fortune by 2045, accelerating his philanthropic efforts through the Gates Foundation. Gates cited Andrew Carnegie's essay 'The Gospel of Wealth' as inspiration, emphasizing the duty of the wealthy to return their fortunes to society. He aims to eliminate preventable diseases, infectious diseases, and poverty, criticizing the US, UK, and France for cutting foreign aid. Gates also addressed comments he made accusing Elon Musk of endangering children's lives through cuts to US aid, specifically mentioning grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique.</p>

          <p>The acting administrator of FEMA, Cameron Hamilton, was abruptly replaced by David Richardson, a Department of Homeland Security official with no known experience in managing natural disasters. This change occurred a day after Hamilton testified before Congress, expressing disagreement with proposals to dismantle FEMA. Hamilton had acknowledged FEMA's bureaucratic inefficiencies but affirmed its importance in aiding communities during crises. The Trump administration has been critical of FEMA's performance and has suggested states should lead disaster response, raising concerns about the agency's future.</p>

The agreement reduces the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum. The deal also includes reciprocal access for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers, although some analysts believe the deal does not meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries before Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>World Central Kitchen (WCK) has been forced to close its community soup kitchens across Gaza due to Israel's ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance, leaving the region with almost no food. The closures impact 133,000 meals per day, exacerbating the already dire hunger situation in Gaza, which is further strained by damage to the water system and fuel shortages. UNICEF reports that most of Gaza's water system is damaged, and water availability has plummeted to 3-5 liters per person per day, far below the WHO's survival minimum. Despite aid trucks waiting at the borders, they cannot enter without permission, and Israel maintains the blockade until Hamas releases hostages.</p>

Yet recent data shows that companies are moving to pass along those added expenses to American consumers, which may push up prices. For example, 76% of Texas manufacturers said they plan to pass tariff-related costs to consumers, while 50% say they will absorb costs internally, according to recent survey data from Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sløk and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

          <h2>US and Britain Announce Trade Deal Reducing Tariffs on Key Imports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Britain announced a deal that will reduce tariffs on some imports, such as steel, cars, and ethanol, marking the first trade agreement since President Trump increased tariffs. The deal aims to deepen the economic relationship between the two countries, but the specifics are still being negotiated. The agreement will relieve Britain's auto industry, facing 10 percent tariffs on the first 100,000 cars exported annually to the United States. The deal is viewed as a win for both countries, but it is not an economic game changer.</p>

The dismissal follows Haggis being found liable in the New York case and ordered to pay $10 million to Haleigh Breest. Haggis' attorney said the timing of the lie, and the inevitability that it would be exposed, strongly suggest her false accusation was planned to sabotage Paul’s other case on the eve of trial.</p>
