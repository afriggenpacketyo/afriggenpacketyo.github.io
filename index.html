          <h2>Federal Shutdown Jeopardizes Nutrition Aid for Millions of New Parents</h2>

          <p>The federal government shutdown is threatening the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides crucial nutrition assistance to millions of pregnant women and new parents. Serving nearly half of all U.S. infants and children up to age five, the program's benefits for baby formula, breastfeeding support, and nutrition counseling are at risk. While states are utilizing contingency funds, the National WIC Association warns that funding could deplete in approximately two weeks, potentially leading to the prioritization of pregnant and breastfeeding women over preschool-aged children. This situation highlights the severe impact on vulnerable families, exacerbated by rising food prices, though the larger SNAP program remains more secure for now.</p>

Flight data collected during this test will inform further improvements, aiming to adapt the airship for a broader array of applications. With a maximum altitude of 3,100 meters, the AS700 is slated for future deployment in critical areas such as emergency rescue, aerial surveillance, and tailored flight-support missions, showcasing China's growing aerospace capabilities. This achievement marks a notable step in its development for both civilian and potential strategic uses.</p>

          <p>Israeli naval ships intercepted multiple vessels of the Global Sumud Flotilla, which was attempting to deliver aid to Gaza, leading to the detention of activists, including climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Israel's Foreign Ministry stated the vessels were "safely stopped" as they approached an active combat zone, while the flotilla organizers condemned the interception as illegal and a desperate act to maintain Gaza's isolation. The incident has sparked international outrage, with Turkey denouncing it as an "act of terrorism" and Colombia expelling Israeli diplomats. This event highlights the ongoing challenges in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza amidst reports of famine and Israeli restrictions.</p>

          <p>Anti-government protests in Morocco, primarily driven by Gen Z networks, turned violent in Lqliaa, resulting in two fatalities when officers fired on a group attempting to storm a police station. The demonstrations, which have also led to over 400 arrests and nearly 300 injuries, initially sought reforms in public services, education, and healthcare. A key grievance for protesters is the government's investment in 2030 Fifa World Cup stadiums while perceived neglect of pressing social crises persists, alongside high youth unemployment. This deadly escalation underscores deep-seated popular discontent over Morocco's social inequalities and a demand for governmental accountability.</p>

Retailers, such as Chow Tai Fook, note that consumers have gradually accepted this new price level, indicating that the cultural importance of gold in wedding traditions appears to outweigh price sensitivity for many couples in the region.

Elden had accused the band of sexual exploitation and sought damages for ongoing personal harm, but the judge also dismissed his claim that his injuries extended into adulthood, which would have allowed him to bypass the statute of limitations.

          <p>Amidst the government shutdown, a contentious debate has emerged from Republican claims that Democrats aim to provide free healthcare to immigrants residing illegally in the U.S., a charge Democrats vehemently deny. Republicans cite a Democratic proposal that would reverse recent Medicaid eligibility restrictions, thereby restoring coverage for lawfully present immigrants, including green card holders, refugees, and asylum seekers. U.S. law generally prohibits federal benefits for those without legal status, though emergency care may be reimbursed. This article clarifies that Democrats seek to restore coverage for individuals with legal status or government permission, not for all undocumented individuals, highlighting the nuanced policy differences.</p>

The discussions involve Chery gaining access to Renault’s existing factory network, while providing capital and product design expertise. Plans include Chery utilizing Renault's Envigado plant in Colombia for combustion-engine cars, with the majority rebadged as Renaults, and considering investment in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line at Renault’s Córdoba factory in Argentina. While talks are ongoing and a definitive deal is not yet certain, this collaboration could significantly expand both companies' presence and production capabilities in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced significant cuts, totaling nearly $8 billion, from climate projects in 16 Democratic-leaning states, including California's major clean hydrogen energy hub. Russell Vought, OMB director, stated these "Green New Scam" funds were canceled because the projects did not "adequately advance the nation’s energy needs" or provide a positive return on investment. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the move as political retaliation, arguing it threatens the future of hydrogen energy, will increase energy costs for families, and undermines job creation. Critics across the political spectrum view these cancellations as vindictive and damaging to critical clean energy progress.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has temporarily blocked the federal government from diverting $34 million in funding intended to protect New York City's transportation system from terrorist attacks. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ruled that the state of New York would likely prove the Trump administration improperly withdrew the money to punish the state for not cooperating with its deportation program. These cuts, which also affected the NYPD's counterterrorism funding, were deemed a "profound mistake" by Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who warned of increased risk to lives. This legal intervention underscores the critical importance of these funds for a city frequently targeted by terrorism.</p>

          <p>China's three most economically important cities have recently eased property curbs, aiming to stabilize the real estate sector and potentially boost consumer sentiment, though analysts caution against expecting a rapid market rebound. While these efforts in first-tier cities might generate short-term regional upticks, the broader property slump remains a significant drag on the economy. Experts emphasize real estate's extensive impact on consumption across numerous industries, with its ongoing crisis contributing to subdued consumer confidence and deflationary pressures. Despite government stimulus measures, persistent household deleveraging and trade tensions continue to pose risks to a sustained economic recovery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration froze approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects: the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway. The White House Office of Management and Budget linked the freeze to "unconstitutional DEI principles" and the ongoing government shutdown, explicitly targeting the home state of Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. Schumer and Jeffries condemned the action as politically motivated and spiteful, arguing that these projects are vital for creating thousands of union jobs, improving commutes, and strengthening national economic competitiveness. This move intensifies the partisan conflict surrounding federal funding and infrastructure development.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the suit as "race-baiting opportunism," asserting that arrests are based on "reasonable suspicion" of illegal presence, not race.

Mayor Pat Burns, a staunch Trump supporter, argues this position addresses concerns about undocumented immigration, despite the state's restrictions on local cooperation with ICE agents. While the Trump administration has previously threatened to withhold federal grants from sanctuary jurisdictions, these attempts have largely been unsuccessful in court.

Sanders, a former college star who played for his father Deion Sanders, was considered by some to be a first-round draft pick but fell to the fifth round.
