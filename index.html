          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. This New York Times article explains that the tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, will affect even cars made in the U.S. due to their reliance on foreign components. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and create uncertainty for carmakers.</p>
