          <p>President Trump's imposition of massive tariffs is seen as a potential economic disaster.  Economists widely predict higher prices and slower growth, potentially leading to a recession.  The move is driven by Trump's belief in tariffs as a source of free money, despite the consensus view that they are primarily paid by domestic consumers.  The lack of dissent within the administration highlights the dangers of the current political climate. </p>
