          <h2>HSBC and Citigroup Optimistic About Chinese Property Stocks Amid Market Recovery</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global banks HSBC and Citigroup are predicting gains for Chinese property stocks, estimating increases of nearly 20% for some developers this year. This optimism is driven by record-low mortgage rates and strong policy support from Beijing, which seeks to stimulate growth amid tariff challenges. HSBC analysts cited low rates, a supply squeeze, and credit normalization as factors driving a structural market recovery. The banks have raised target prices for several mainland developers, indicating a positive outlook for the sector that has been struggling since 2020 due to debt constraints.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is launching an investigation into the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the Department of Education, citing concerns about the impact on students, parents, and teachers. Warren's "Save Our Schools" campaign aims to gather stories from those affected by potential cuts to funding and services, with letters sent to organizations like the NAACP and NEA seeking input. She argues that dismantling the department would jeopardize students' access to affordable, accessible, and high-quality public education. The investigation follows the separation of roughly 2,000 employees from the Education Department.</p>

While Miliband dismissed claims of an energy price "postcode lottery," he confirmed that the government is exploring ways to shake up the energy market, including "zonal pricing and reformed national pricing". The scheme is supported by some energy businesses who believe it could make the overall system more efficient, but critics argue that it could result in higher bills for millions of Britons.</p>

By analyzing the size and patterns of these grooves, researchers hope to better understand how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.

          <p>Racial disparities in youth incarceration have reached their widest point in decades, with Black children nearly six times more likely and American Indian children nearly four times more likely to be incarcerated than white children. Experts attribute this disparity to factors such as heavily policed neighborhoods and unequal access to diversion programs. While youth incarceration rates have declined overall, the disparities have increased, raising concerns about systemic biases in the juvenile justice system. The long-term consequences of incarceration, including reduced educational attainment and increased risk of early death, further exacerbate these inequalities.</p>

          <p>Indonesia plans to increase imports from the United States to reduce its trade surplus, according to Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati.

Indonesia is considering importing more agricultural products, such as wheat, soybeans, and corn, as well as oil and gas, from the U.S. The finance minister emphasized that trade with the U.S. accounts for a relatively small portion of Indonesia's GDP.</p>
