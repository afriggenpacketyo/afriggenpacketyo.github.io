          <p>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has formally moved to prepare a ban against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, following its classification as a suspected extremist group. The motion has created a rift within the ruling coalition, as conservative partners from the CDU/CSU express skepticism and advocate for waiting for a final court ruling on the AfD's status. This debate highlights the deep political and legal complexities surrounding the potential prohibition of Germany's largest opposition party amid its rising popularity and concerns over its extremist ideologies.</p>

          <p>Markus SÃ¶der, a prominent Bavarian political leader, has called for Germany to significantly bolster its national defenses by acquiring a protective shield similar to Israel's 'Iron Dome' system. His proposal includes purchasing 2,000 Patriot missiles, 100,000 drones, and hundreds of new tanks and fighter jets to create a modern, deterrent-capable military. SÃ¶der emphasized the need to cooperate with nations like Ukraine and Israel to leverage their recent combat experience, reflecting a growing sense of urgency within Germany to adapt its security posture to new geopolitical realities.</p>

          <p>Tropical Depression Barry, the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on the eastern coast of Mexico with sustained winds of 35 mph. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves inland but will bring significant rainfall to the region over the next couple of days. Forecasters have warned that the system could produce three to six inches of rain, with isolated totals up to ten inches, across the states of Veracruz, San Luis Potosi, and Tamaulipas. This heavy precipitation poses a considerable threat of flooding and mudslides for inland communities in the storm's path.</p>

          <p>A trend of rising nationalism and right-wing extremism is becoming increasingly visible among young people in eastern German cities like Dessau. The article reports that Nazi slogans and symbols have become a common sight, with some youths viewing right-wing ideology as 'cool' and glorifying Hitler. This radicalization is occurring in regions still grappling with the economic and social aftermath of German reunification. Despite significant investment and cultural initiatives, cities like Dessau struggle with a history of racist violence, creating a complex environment where civic groups and some young people actively resist the growing extremist sentiment.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity shrank for the third straight month in June, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remaining below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from growth. This persistent weakness comes despite government stimulus efforts and highlights ongoing challenges, including a deepening price war and sluggish consumer demand. While there were slight improvements in production and new orders, the data underscores the fragility of the economic recovery and the persistent threat of deflation that has troubled the industrial sector for over two years.

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and another individual was injured after being ambushed by gunfire while responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The incident triggered a large-scale manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies and the FBI. Authorities reported that the first responders were targeted by an assailant using high-powered rifles, prompting a shelter-in-place order for the area. The suspected gunman was later found deceased on the mountain with a firearm nearby, and an investigation is underway to determine if the fire was set to lure emergency personnel to the scene.</p>

          <p>China's decision to conditionally resume imports of Japanese seafood, excluding ten prefectures like Fukushima, marks a potential shift in the diplomatic standoff over the Fukushima nuclear plant's treated water release. Beijing had implemented a full ban in August 2023, citing safety concerns and escalating tensions with Tokyo. This partial reversal is seen as a cautious step, but its ability to facilitate a broader diplomatic reset remains uncertain. The move comes amid ongoing disputes and strong opposition from Chinese authorities, leaving the future of the trade relationship dependent on further negotiations and trust-building measures.</p>

          <p>China has partially lifted its nearly two-year ban on Japanese seafood, which was originally imposed due to concerns over the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The ban was a significant economic blow to Japan's fishing industry, as China was its largest export market. While imports from most of Japan can now resume, the prohibition remains for ten prefectures, including Fukushima. Japanese exporters must re-register and provide health and origin certificates, as all shipments will be subject to rigorous testing and compliance checks by Chinese customs authorities.</p>

However, the defense claims it was a tragic accident, asserting that Patterson panicked after unintentionally using the toxic fungi.

Despite a strategic partnership with Tehran, Moscow failed to provide significant military or diplomatic support, offering only platitudes instead of concrete aid. The author contends that this inaction is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern of neglect towards its allies, driven by Russia's preoccupation with its costly and draining war in Ukraine.

          <p>A new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that President Trump's major legislative bill would increase the U.S. national debt by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

The findings have amplified concerns about the bill's fiscal impact, which includes steep cuts to healthcare coverage alongside increased government spending, intensifying the political debate surrounding the legislation.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Cause Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, researchers are examining why they are more prone to inducing motion sickness than traditional combustion engine cars. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a key factor. This system, which recovers kinetic energy to charge the battery, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness and discomfort in passengers. Scientists are now exploring solutions, including auditory cues, to mitigate these effects and improve the passenger experience in the growing EV market.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, a decision that came hours after President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. Tillis opposed the president's major spending bill, citing concerns over devastating Medicaid cuts for his state. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, noting that independent thinking is increasingly scorned. His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a state that has historically favored Republican candidates in national elections.</p>

Grossi's assessment raises questions about the long-term effectiveness of the military action, emphasizing that the knowledge and skills cannot be eliminated.
