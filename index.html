          <p>Recent close-up, air-to-air photographs of China's J-35 stealth fighter have emerged, providing strong evidence that the aircraft has entered initial production and is nearing operational readiness. The jets are shown with official Chinese navy markings and "Flying Shark" insignia, signaling their formal integration into the naval aviation force. According to a military analyst, the visible serial numbers suggest a low-rate initial production run, indicating the J-35 is likely being prepared for deployment on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, and is building its combat capabilities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested Pierre Reginald Boulos, a lawful permanent resident and Haitian citizen, for allegedly contributing to instability in Haiti through support for violent gangs. The Department of State determined that Boulos collaborated with gang leaders linked to Viv Ansanm, a group the U.S. has designated a foreign terrorist organization. ICE also alleges Boulos committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose his founding role in a Haitian political party and alleged misuse of loans, which could justify his deportation. Boulos is currently being held in an ICE detention facility in Miami.</p>

          <h2>Court Allows Trump Administration to End Deportation Protections for Afghan and Cameroonian Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:22:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 migrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs had a plausible case but found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues. The administration argues that conditions in both countries have improved enough for their nationals to return, a claim disputed by advocacy groups who cite ongoing conflict and State Department travel warnings. Those losing TPS protections face potential deportation unless they can secure another form of legal status.</p>

          <p>Critics of President Trump allege he is attempting to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case by making a series of unrelated and headline-grabbing statements. These include demanding the Washington Commanders revert to their former name and attacking political opponents. The accusations of distraction come as the administration faces backlash for its handling of the Epstein files, including an announcement that no "client list" exists. Prominent figures like Rev. Al Sharpton and Senator Adam Schiff have claimed these moves are a deliberate strategy to shift the narrative.</p>

The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair. The Air Force and the FAA are both investigating the incident to determine why the commercial flight was not advised of the bomber's presence in its flight path.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have an unintended positive consequence by exposing and prompting the removal of self-defeating internal trade barriers in other countries. Nations and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing domestic regulations that hinder their own economic potential. The pressure from U.S. tariffs is forcing these entities to confront their own protectionist policies and consider reforms, such as China's push for a "unified domestic market." The article suggests this forced self-reflection could lead to greater economic freedom and efficiency globally. (not investment advice)</p>

Farmer expressed exhaustion with the politicization of the case but emphasized that real crimes were committed and victims are still seeking answers. She voiced skepticism about the Trump administration's handling of the files and concern over the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey.

          <p>The Trump administration has removed a Wall Street Journal reporter from the official press pool accompanying the president on a trip to Scotland, in an apparent act of retaliation. The move follows the newspaper's publication of an article detailing an alleged birthday letter from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which prompted Trump to file a $10 billion libel lawsuit against the paper. The White House Correspondents’ Association condemned the decision as an attempt to punish a media outlet for its coverage and a defiance of First Amendment principles. This action escalates the conflict between the administration and the press over the ongoing Epstein controversy.</p>

The flash floods, which killed at least 135 people, prompted a massive effort to locate everyone. This sharp revision in the number of missing persons is common in the aftermath of large-scale disasters, as initial reports are often inflated due to the chaotic situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth's rotation has been speeding up, causing days to become marginally shorter. This trend could force global timekeepers to take an unprecedented step: subtracting a "negative leap second" from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep atomic clocks synchronized with the planet's rotation. While 27 positive leap seconds have been added since 1972 to account for a slower spin, the recent acceleration presents a new challenge for computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise timekeeping. Interestingly, scientists note that the melting of polar ice due to climate change has slightly counteracted this speed-up by redistributing Earth's mass.</p>

The article details the administration's aggressive rhetoric against judges and its prolific use of executive orders, which forces legal challenges and pushes confrontations through a more favorable judiciary, raising questions about the long-term impact on judicial independence.</p>

          <p>The 13-year-old step-grandson of reality TV star Duane "Dog the Bounty Hunter" Chapman has died from a gunshot wound in what is being described as a "tragic accident." The teenager, Anthony, was allegedly shot by his own father, who is Chapman's stepson, at an apartment in Naples, Florida. Local law enforcement is investigating the shooting as an isolated incident and has not yet made an arrest. In a statement, Chapman and his wife confirmed the death of their grandson and asked for privacy as their family grieves the incomprehensible loss.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has filed a complaint asking the Department of Justice to investigate the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges that the university systematically uses race and identity-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby violating civil rights laws and the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. The group specifically criticizes the university's use of socioeconomic status as a proxy for race and calls for an end to all diversity-focused programs and a suspension of federal funding supporting them.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Hankison, the only officer convicted in connection with the incident, was found guilty of using excessive force by firing recklessly into her apartment. The sentence comes after the Trump-led Justice Department controversially recommended he serve only one day in prison, a position the judge rejected. Taylor's family expressed gratitude for the prison time but criticized the prosecution's recommendation for a lighter sentence.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened scrutiny of his past, a 2006 interview from "The Howard Stern Show" has resurfaced in which Donald Trump discussed his sexual "age limit." When asked by the host if he could be with a 24-year-old, Trump responded affirmatively and, when pressed on a limit, stated he didn't want to be like a congressman involved with "12-year-olds." The comments are drawing new attention following the controversy over the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The article also notes Trump's recent $10 billion libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for a story about an alleged birthday note he sent to Epstein.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece from The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency is animated not by a coherent policy ideology but by a culture of pettiness, anger, and retribution. The author points to various actions, from renaming military bases to feuds with former officials and attempts to fire the Fed Chairman, as examples of personal grievances driving executive decisions. The article suggests that even major foreign policy moves, such as recent decisions on aid to Ukraine, are reactions to being personally slighted by figures like Vladimir Putin. This governance by emotion, the author contends, creates a chaotic and unpredictable administration focused on settling scores.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to use military facilities in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, according to correspondence with the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the request, which allows for the use of Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey for immigrant detention through September 2025. The plan also includes increasing detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to increase the arrest and detention of people in the country without legal status.</p>

          <p>This NPR segment profiles Emil Bove, one of President Trump's most controversial judicial nominees, who is now one step away from a federal judgeship. The article notes that during his first term, Trump successfully reshaped the federal courts by appointing conservative, originalist judges, often with guidance from the Federalist Society. As the judicial nomination process restarts, Bove's potential appointment is seen as indicative of the next phase of this effort. His nomination is presented as a key example of the administration's ongoing push to install judges who align with its political and legal philosophy.</p>

The article highlights the story of an accountant in Chengdu who has not had a raise in five years and now faces the possibility of being laid off, making his dream of homeownership feel unattainable. According to a finance professor at the University of Hong Kong, there is a significant distinction between the government's rosy economic data and the actual feelings of households and businesses.

Judge Darrin Gayles presided over the 2023 case that Trump voluntarily withdrew after the judge scheduled a deposition for the then-president. This assignment raises the possibility that Trump will again face a decision on whether to sit for a deposition under oath, this time to answer questions from Murdoch's lawyers regarding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit stems from a Journal article about an alleged birthday letter from Trump to Epstein.</p>
