          <p>A fire broke out in an elderly ward at the Marienkrankenhaus in Hamburg, resulting in the deaths of three people. Emergency workers responded to the scene, where they treated over 35 injured individuals, two of whom were sent to other hospitals. The fire brigade was unable to reach the three victims during the rescue operation, and the cause of the fire is currently unknown. Firefighters managed to prevent the flames from spreading to other parts of the four-story building, rescuing patients using ladders and fire escape hoods, as many were elderly and had mobility issues. </p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, but the resulting images are somewhat blurred. While not as powerful as night vision goggles, the lenses could be used in surgical procedures, cryptography, or counterfeit protection, and tests showed humans could recognize patterns and letters in the dark.</p>

          <p>Two bridges in Russian regions bordering Ukraine were blown up, resulting in at least seven deaths and 69 injuries, according to Russian officials. The incidents occurred just before planned peace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. A highway bridge in the Bryansk region was destroyed as a passenger train passed underneath, and a railway bridge in the Kursk region was blown up shortly after. Russian politicians have blamed Ukraine for the sabotage, suggesting it was an attempt to derail the peace talks, but Ukraine has not commented on the incidents.</p>

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies from the Defense Ministry for security-related technology research since fiscal 2015. This funding has become an important source for researchers amid budget constraints and declining student numbers. The program supports state-of-the-art projects, including developing sheets that absorb harmful gases and systems that use AI to detect cyberattacks. However, some experts have expressed concern about the potential military applications of this research and the ministry's influence over researchers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a significant drone attack on Russian military aircraft, according to a Ukrainian security official. The official claimed that the SBU domestic intelligence agency struck four Russian military air bases simultaneously, hitting over 40 aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22 strategic bombers. While Reuters could not immediately verify these assertions, video footage allegedly showing the strikes was shared, depicting large aircraft on fire. The attack follows Russia's proposal for fresh talks in Istanbul, though Kyiv has not confirmed its attendance.</p>

The show delves into the practical work of a rabbi as LÃ©a interprets religious texts and traditions for her congregants. The series is based on Delphine Horvilleur's book, "Living With Our Dead," and explores the evolution and interpretation of Judaism.</p>

          <h2>Systemic Issues Plague American Air Travel, Highlighted by Newark Airport Problems</h2>

          <p>The American air travel system is facing a crisis, exemplified by ongoing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport, including radar outages and understaffed air traffic control. These issues are not isolated to Newark but are systemic, stemming from staff retention and training challenges, infrastructure problems, and outdated systems. The FAA's budget struggles to keep pace with maintenance needs, leading to mandatory overtime and burnout among air traffic controllers. Potential solutions include increased government funding, fees for fliers, or reducing the number of flights to alleviate congestion.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for various sectors. The level of NHS spending will determine whether cuts are made to "unprotected" areas like transport, schools, and the criminal justice system. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's stance on ruling out borrowing and tax increases suggests potential spending cuts are imminent. The IFS highlights that the government has front-loaded spending, meaning the flow of additional funding will slow down.</p>
