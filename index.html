          <p>A hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in Santa Catarina, Brazil, resulting in the deaths of at least eight people and injuries to thirteen others. The incident occurred during a popular activity in the region's June festivities, with the balloon carrying 21 people, including the pilot. According to the pilot, a fire started in the basket, prompting him to order passengers to jump before the balloon fell; some were unable to jump in time, leading to the tragic outcome. The company operating the balloon stated that it complied with all regulations and is suspending operations indefinitely, as authorities investigate the cause of the crash, which follows a similar incident last week in SÃ£o Paulo and other fatal balloon crashes in recent years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of State has commenced assisted departure flights for American citizens and lawful permanent residents in Israel and the West Bank, according to U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. This announcement follows previous confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for evacuations, with the State Department initially denying plans for assisted departures. The State Department has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel due to ongoing armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest, with Ben Gurion International Airport closed and commercial airlines suspending flights to the United States. Amid heightened tensions with Iran, missile strikes have resulted in numerous casualties, including some U.S. citizens who were lightly wounded. </p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has renewed his calls for a special prosecutor to investigate the 2020 presidential election, claiming it was rigged against him. In a Truth Social post, Trump criticized the Biden administration's handling of border crossings and reiterated his unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud. He has long maintained that various misdeeds led to Joe Biden's victory and has continued to assert these claims during his 2024 re-election bid. Trump's assertions have been widely disputed, with his own attorney general stating there was no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome and the Department of Homeland Security declaring the election the most secure in American history.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration's attempts to silence pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Khalil, who was arrested for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize those who disagree with the administration's policies. His release follows a judge's ruling that he is not a flight risk or threat, though the Trump administration plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year, surpassing 33C, as a Met Office warning for thunderstorms went into effect. A yellow weather warning is in place for parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and north-east Wales, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert issued by the UK Health Security Agency remains in force until Monday, with research suggesting nearly 600 people could die in the next four days due to the heat in England and Wales. Passengers were evacuated from a train in south London due to a fault amidst the high temperatures.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly moving B-2 bombers to Guam as President Trump considers potential strikes against Iran. The deployment's connection to Middle East tensions is unclear. The B-2 bomber can carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, potentially used to strike Iran's nuclear program. Experts are monitoring whether the bombers will move to Diego Garcia, a U.S.-British military base ideally positioned for operations in the Middle East.</p>

Ford plans to outsource engine development and manufacturing to suppliers. This decision is driven by competition from Chinese automakers and a desire to accelerate electrification. Critics argue that reliability and performance are still important factors for consumers, and proprietary engine designs can be a competitive advantage. (not investment advice)</p>
