          <h2>Putin Calls for Direct Talks with Ukraine Amidst European Pressure for Ceasefire</h2>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested "direct talks" with Ukraine should commence next week, specifically as early as May 15, aiming to address the root causes of the conflict and move towards a lasting peace. This proposal comes shortly after European leaders, including the UK Prime Minister and French President, visited Ukraine urging Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, a demand which Putin seemingly brushed aside. Putin stated Russia is prepared for serious negotiations with Ukraine without preconditions, proposing a meeting in Istanbul, potentially continuing talks from March 2022. This article highlights the ongoing diplomatic tensions and efforts to find a resolution amidst the conflict.</p>

          <p>Farmer David Thornley is pursuing legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe led to polluted water in Diseworth Brook, resulting in the loss of several pedigree lambs in 2022. Thornley noticed a strong odor and unusual substance in the brook, later confirmed by laboratory tests to contain bacteria unfit for livestock consumption. While the airport acknowledged a small leak, it denies any connection between the discharge and the bacterial pollution. This article underscores the environmental concerns associated with airport operations and their potential impact on local agriculture and water quality.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia, setting a potential meeting for May 15 in Istanbul, Turkey, while dismissing European leaders' demands for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. This comes as Britain, France, Germany, and Poland jointly visited Ukraine to announce potential new sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if a ceasefire is not agreed upon. The United States, under President Trump, is reportedly supportive of the European effort and may assist in monitoring a ceasefire. The article frames the competing proposals as efforts to position themselves as seeking peace, with the US seemingly pushing for negotiations.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's interim government has banned the Awami League, the political party of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, citing the deaths of hundreds during anti-government protests in 2024.

The decision follows protests calling for the ban, with demonstrators refusing to leave the streets until their demands were met.

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials concluded a day of negotiations over tariffs in Switzerland, with President Trump claiming "great progress" was made and a "total reset" was negotiated. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. While there was no immediate indication of progress, discussions likely focused on de-escalation, with Bessent suggesting the high tariffs imposed by both countries are not sustainable.

Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of credible leads. The break came when a thumbprint found on a cigarette carton in the victim's car matched Sims's, thanks to an upgrade in the F.B.I.â€™s fingerprint search algorithm. The arrest brings closure to a decades-long investigation and offers some solace to Ralston's family.</p>

The export restrictions, implemented in response to increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, affect several categories of medium and heavy rare earths, potentially disrupting the supply chain for essential military technologies.</p>
