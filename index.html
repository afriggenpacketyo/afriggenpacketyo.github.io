          <p>After an impressive 29 seasons, Gregg Popovich has resigned as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs and will transition to president of basketball operations. Popovich holds the NBA record for regular-season victories with 1,422 wins and led the Spurs to five NBA championships, the last being in 2014. Popovich expressed gratitude to the players, coaches, staff, and fans, with Mitch Johnson stepping in as the new head coach. Popovich, who also coached the US men's basketball team to a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached a settlement in principle with the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot while attempting to breach the House Speaker's Lobby during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The settlement averts a trial in a $30 million civil suit filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of Babbitt's estate, which alleged that U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in his use of force. The Justice Department, under the Biden administration, defended Byrd's actions, stating that Babbitt was unlawfully entering the Capitol and posed a threat. Babbitt's death became a rallying point for Trump supporters who claimed police used excessive force.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry stated in a BBC interview that he desires reconciliation with his family in Britain, expressing concern over his father King Charles's health.

He acknowledged that his memoir "Spare" has caused division but hopes to resolve the conflict, as he has only been able to attend funerals and court hearings in the UK since stepping down from his royal duties.</p>

The White House plans to reduce foreign aid while increasing funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

The plan also suggests a two-year cap on rental assistance for able-bodied adults, prioritizing the elderly and disabled. Advocates warn that these cuts could lead to a surge in homelessness, as many renters already struggle to afford housing. The proposal comes as nearly half of all renters are considered cost-burdened and homelessness is at a record high, raising concerns about the potential impact on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>An Illinois landlord, Joseph Czuba, has been sentenced to 53 years in prison for the hate-crime murder of a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and the severe wounding of his mother. The attack occurred shortly after the start of the Israel-Gaza war, with prosecutors arguing that Czuba targeted the family because of their Muslim faith. The trial included harrowing testimony from the victim's mother and Czuba's ex-wife, who stated that he had become agitated by the war. The crime has sparked outrage and fear within the Muslim community.</p>
