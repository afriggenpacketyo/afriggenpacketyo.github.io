        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Veteran Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has accused the Labour Party leadership of wanting to force her out of the party following her second suspension. The disciplinary action was taken after a BBC interview where she stated she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her initial suspension. In her remarks, Abbott differentiated between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice, a stance that has drawn significant controversy. She maintains her comments were factually correct, while the party moves to investigate the matter again amid its ongoing efforts to address issues of antisemitism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is advancing a legislative package requested by President Trump to rescind approximately $9 billion in previously approved government funding. The proposed cuts primarily target foreign assistance programs, such as USAID, and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The bill, which faces a deadline, passed the Senate with narrow Republican support after some modifications. The process in the House has been slowed by Democratic efforts to attach measures related to the release of the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged past U.S. accusations that European nations were not contributing enough to their own defense, stating that Europe had been "free-riders in the past." In a BBC interview, Merz affirmed that Germany and its allies are now significantly increasing their defense spending in response to the threat from Russia. He emphasized that he is coordinating closely with the Trump administration on both the war in Ukraine and ongoing trade debates, signaling a unified stance between the key allies.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of his death, tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states participated in marches and rallies to honor the legacy of civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis. Under the banner "Good Trouble Lives On," demonstrators protested against the Trump administration's policies on voting rights, immigration, and civil liberties. The day of action, organized by dozens of advocacy groups, channeled Lewis's call for engaging in "good trouble, necessary trouble" to advance social justice and oppose policies they view as harmful.</p>

          <p>This article details the persistent conflict between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed during his first term. The president's dissatisfaction stems primarily from the Fed's monetary policy, specifically its decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, which Trump argues is stifling economic growth. Trump has publicly criticized Powell, while Powell has defended the central bank's independence and its dual mandate of maximizing employment and maintaining price stability. The tension highlights the classic friction between political desires for short-term growth and the Fed's long-term economic goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition, following public speculation prompted by photos showing bruising on his hand and swollen legs. A presidential physician stated the condition is benign, particularly for individuals over 70, and that Trump remains in "excellent health." The announcement explained that the bruising was likely due to frequent handshaking combined with taking aspirin as a cardiovascular preventative measure, and that tests showed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis.</p>

          <p>Five men deported by the U.S. to Eswatini, a southern African nation with which they have no ties, are being held in solitary confinement for an undetermined period. The deportation occurred under the Trump administration's third-country program after the men's home countries refused to accept them. An Eswatini government spokesperson confirmed the confinement, citing security concerns, and stated the plan is to eventually repatriate them. The situation raises significant human rights concerns, given the U.S. State Department's own reports on credible accounts of torture and poor prison conditions in the absolute monarchy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis suggests the Labour Party had little alternative but to suspend Diane Abbott again to maintain consistency with its stated principles. Abbott's recent declaration that she did not regret the 2023 remarks which led to her first suspension created a difficult position for the party leadership. Given Sir Keir Starmer's firm pledge to eradicate antisemitism from the party, failing to act on her unretracted comments would have undermined his authority and the party's stance. The decision reflects the delicate political context and Labour's recent history with antisemitism controversies.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, a move the network describes as a purely financial decision. The cancellation reflects broader challenges in the late-night television landscape, including declining advertising revenue and a shift in viewership habits towards short-form online content. Despite the show consistently ranking number one in its time slot for nine seasons, the franchise will be retired. Colbert, who was informed of the decision recently, shared the news with his audience during a taping.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers in the U.S. are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with ground beef and steaks reaching new peaks. The price surge is driven by a historically tight supply, as the national cattle herd has shrunk to its lowest level since 1951. This decline is attributed to several factors, including years of drought that raised feed costs, high cattle prices incentivizing sales over breeding, and a cutoff of cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak. Experts do not expect significant price relief in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>
