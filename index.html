          <p>A significant system failure at NATS, the UK's air traffic control provider, led to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounded thousands more across the country. Airlines, including EasyJet and Ryanair, expressed extreme disappointment, with Ryanair calling for the NATS chief executive's resignation due to perceived mismanagement. While the technical issue was resolved relatively quickly within 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, the extensive disruption is expected to persist for several days, significantly impacting thousands of passengers and their summer holiday plans. This incident underscores the critical need for robust resilience in national air traffic infrastructure and the profound economic and personal fallout from such unforeseen technical failures.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Pakistan have announced a new trade agreement, under which Washington will assist in developing Pakistan's substantial oil reserves. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister confirmed the deal, stating it would lead to lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the US. This development follows the US imposing a 25% tariff on India, Pakistan's rival, for its trade with Russia, which Trump publicly criticized. The agreement suggests a potential shift in regional trade dynamics, with Trump even suggesting Pakistan could someday sell oil to India, highlighting a complex interplay of international relations and economic strategy.</p>

The project, a joint venture with Nscale and Aker, aims to deploy 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by late 2026 and will operate entirely on renewable hydropower. This initiative is part of OpenAI's broader $500 billion global infrastructure expansion, extending its Stargate project from the US and UAE. The move also aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," emphasizing data processing within European borders and leveraging abundant, low-cost renewable energy sources in the region.</p>

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned remarks by Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente, who referred to French Jewish teenagers removed from a flight as "Israeli kids." The incident, which occurred on July 23, involved 44 teenagers and their counselors being disembarked from a Vueling flight to Paris, with the airline citing "inappropriate behavior" and safety risks. France criticized the minister's statement as discriminatory and unacceptable, also condemning the alleged excessive force used by Spain's Guardia Civil against a counselor. The airline has launched an internal investigation amid conflicting reports about the teenagers' conduct and the reasons for their removal.</p>

          <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke revealed that Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia and the new Air Borneo, are interested in purchasing China's C919 passenger jet. This interest is driven by growing air travel demand in Southeast Asia and significant delivery backlogs from traditional manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. Airlines are seeking to diversify their aircraft procurement and explore cheaper, faster options offered by Shanghai-based Comac. The minister emphasized that while interest exists, no commercial negotiations have been confirmed yet, indicating a potential shift in the regional aviation market dynamics and a challenge to the established duopoly.</p>

          <p>The US has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes, accusing him of authorizing "arbitrary pre-trial detentions" and suppressing "freedom of expression." Judge Moraes is leading an investigation into former President Jair Bolsonaro for an alleged coup plot, which Bolsonaro denies. Following the sanctions, President Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil, linking it directly to the "politically motivated persecution" of Bolsonaro. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the sanctions as "unacceptable" interference in Brazil's justice system, escalating tensions between the two nations and impacting their historical relationship and trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Australia has enacted a pioneering national ban on social media for youth, a measure pitched as a solution to a growing mental health crisis among teenagers. The law, which takes effect in December, imposes substantial fines on platforms like TikTok and Facebook for failing to block underage users, though individuals will not be penalized. While the ban aims to protect young people from cyberbullying and harmful content, some experts question its effectiveness, citing a lack of clear causal links between social media and mental health. Critics also warn it might push young users to less regulated online spaces and emphasize the need for broader mental health system reforms.</p>

          <p>UK high streets are grappling with an "endless battle" against organized crime gangs engaged in the widespread sale of illegal tobacco and vapes, as highlighted by numerous shop closures in Newport. Trading Standards officers describe a pervasive problem involving forced labor, illegal workers, and the brazen sale of illicit goods, which undermines legitimate retailers and funds wider criminal activities. Residents and business owners report fear due to intimidation, open drug dealing, and even an acid attack. Authorities face limited powers, with criminals often reopening shops or using "stash cars" to continue their operations, indicating a complex and challenging enforcement landscape.</p>

          <p>Top Texas Democrats are vehemently opposing a new GOP plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, labeling it "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic." The proposed map aims to convert five Democratic-held US House districts into GOP-leaning seats, significantly diluting minority representation, particularly in Latino-majority areas. Democrats warn this gerrymandering could trigger a nationwide ripple effect, potentially leading other states to redraw their maps. They argue the plan is an illegal voter suppression tactic and expresses concern that the strategy, relying on recent Hispanic voter shifts, could backfire for Republicans given evolving political dynamics and potential legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder and five other charges in the poisoning death of his wife, Angela. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig administered a "lethal cocktail of arsenic, cyanide and tetrahydrozoline" in her protein shakes, leading to her death in 2023. The investigation revealed a financial motive, including $4 million in life insurance policies, and extramarital affairs coinciding with his wife's deteriorating health. Craig also faced solicitation charges for attempting to hire someone to kill the lead investigator and seeking false testimony.

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) contracted more than expected in July, falling to 49.3, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline. This contraction reflects a broader economic slowdown and ongoing US trade tensions, with some orders shifting to lower-tariffed countries like Vietnam. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the decline partly to traditional off-season factors, extreme heat, and torrential rain. Analysts noted that Beijing's "anti-involution" efforts to address overcapacity also impacted the economy, suggesting that the tariff impact on China's economy will become more apparent from August onwards, posing significant challenges for growth.

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat, former envoy to Germany Shi Mingde, suggests that the European Union's latest trade deal with Washington may inadvertently deepen its economic and security dependence on the US. Shi argues that while the EU aims to reduce reliance on China through "de-risking" policies, its dependence on the US remains stronger and is further reinforced by recent agreements. Beijing views the de-risking strategy as a veiled attempt to contain Chinese growth, particularly in technology. This perspective highlights a fundamental divergence in how China and the EU perceive the bloc's pursuit of strategic autonomy in the current geopolitical climate.</p>
