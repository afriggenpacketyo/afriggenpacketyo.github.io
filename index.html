            <p>A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River near Lower Manhattan, resulting in at least three fatalities, with sources indicating that children were among the five passengers on board. Witnesses described the helicopter plummeting at a steep angle, accompanied by a loud sonic boom and the rotor detaching mid-air. Rescuers arrived to find the aircraft inverted in the frigid waters, closer to the New Jersey shoreline, and the incident is currently under investigation. The crash prompted a swift response from marine and land units, and the authorities are working to determine the exact cause of the accident.</p>

            <p>The House of Representatives adopted President Trump's budget blueprint after Republican leaders secured the backing of conservative holdouts seeking deeper spending cuts. The resolution passed with a narrow margin, as assurances were made regarding Senate pursuit of significant savings. House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasized alignment between the two chambers, while some Republicans expressed distrust in the Senate's commitment to substantial cuts. Democrats criticized the proposed cuts, warning of adverse impacts on entitlement programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.</p>

Harvard University economist Lawrence Summers said the developments suggested a serious financial crisis induced by U.S. government tariff policy.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates are unlikely to decrease in the near future, even with President Trump's tariff pause, primarily due to a sharp sell-off in government bonds. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds have increased, influencing mortgage rates to remain near 7%. Experts anticipate mortgage rates to fluctuate between 6.5% and 7%, reflecting market volatility caused by tariffs and recession fears. Zillow forecasts rates to end the year in the mid-6% range.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Postal Service is proposing a rate increase that would raise the price of a first-class "forever" stamp from 73 cents to 78 cents. The request has been submitted to the Postal Regulatory Commission for approval, and if approved, the increase would take effect in July. The Postal Service argues that the rate hike is necessary to achieve financial stability, as it seeks to become self-sufficient. The proposal comes after previous warnings of "uncomfortable" rate hikes and recent discussions about privatizing mail service.</p>

            <p>A massive short squeeze helped drive stocks to historic gains. Hedge funds that had shorted stocks were forced to buy back their borrowed stocks rapidly in order to limit their losses, pushing the S&P 500 up. Short positioning was almost twice as much as the size seen in the first quarter of 2020, and a basket of the most shorted stocks surged. A whopping 30 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges during the session, marking the heaviest volume day on record.</p>

            <p>President Trump's promise to "end" the U.S. offshore wind industry has created uncertainty, particularly in the Northeast, which has invested heavily in the industry. Trump signed an executive action that paused all federal permitting for new offshore wind projects and set in motion a broad review of what he says are the industry's environmental and economic harms. States in the region see offshore wind as the best way to meet increasing electricity demands and drive economic growth, while also satisfying their climate goals.</p>

After Trump announced he was putting some of the most eye-watering tariffs on pause, shares stopped sliding and rallied.

With tariffs on imports from China at 145%, sellers must decide whether to raise prices or absorb the increased costs. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said its vast network of third-party sellers will likely "pass the cost on" to consumers. Some sellers are considering moving manufacturing out of China, but staying overseas, while others find it financially infeasible to relocate manufacturing to the U.S.</p>
