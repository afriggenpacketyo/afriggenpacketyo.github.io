            <h2>Trump's Trade Policies Could Open Doors for China in Asia-Pacific Trade</h2>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's recent imposition of sweeping tariffs on numerous countries, framed as 'Liberation Day,' could inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This trade agreement, which includes nations like Australia, Canada, and Japan, emerged from the ashes of the Trans-Pacific Partnership after the U.S. withdrew under Trump's initial term. As countries seek to counter the effects of Trump's tariffs, they may be more inclined to support China's application to the CPTPP, potentially shifting the balance of economic power in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have reached a memorandum of understanding that permits ICE to access taxpayer information to locate illegal immigrants subject to deportation. This agreement aims to streamline law enforcement's ability to combat illegal immigration while protecting the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers. The agreement focuses on immigrants who have failed or refused to leave the United States 90 days after a judge has issued a final order of removal, and the process includes guardrails to ensure sensitive taxpayer data is protected. Some IRS officials have expressed concern that this policy could hinder tax collection from illegal immigrants.</p>

            <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla have released new photographs to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary during their state visit to Italy. The visit, initially planned to include the Vatican, was altered due to the Pope's ill health.

The visit also highlights the cultural and economic ties between the UK and Italy, with the King and Queen's enthusiasm for Italian culture being well received by the Italian public.</p>

            <p>The Florida Gators triumphed over the Houston Cougars with a final score of 65-63, clinching their third NCAA men's basketball championship.

The game was a defensive battle, with Florida overcoming a double-digit deficit in the second half. This victory marks Florida's first championship since 2007 and makes their coach, Todd Golden, the youngest to win the title since 1983.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as President Trump threatened additional tariffs on China, exacerbating existing recession concerns. Leading indexes initially fell sharply, briefly rebounded on a false report of a tariff freeze, and then declined again. Economists at Goldman Sachs have increased the odds of a recession to 45%, citing the impact of tariffs on economic growth and inflation. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.2%, while overseas markets also suffered steep losses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has stated its strong opposition to President Trump's threat to escalate tariffs on Chinese goods, promising countermeasures to protect its rights and interests. This response follows Trump's announcement that he would impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs. China views this as a mistake on top of a mistake and asserts that it will not back down if the U.S. persists in its approach. Morgan Stanley estimates that the new levies could reduce China's economic growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points this year.</p>

            <p>A former People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officer, Zhou Bo, argues that China's rise and influence in the international order are 'unstoppable' as the U.S. grows weary of policing the world. Zhou suggests that while the Taiwan issue remains a potential conflict flashpoint, China's military build-up, particularly its navy, is also driven by the need to safeguard its overseas interests and shoulder international responsibilities. He believes that President Trump's policies are creating opportunities for China to expand its influence on the global stage. Zhou examines these questions in his book, 'Should the World Fear China?', which explores China's rising international status and its influence in geopolitics.</p>

The piece highlights the softening tone from European officials towards China and the growing interest in understanding life in Hong Kong as a gateway between the world and mainland China. The author argues that the reciprocal tariffs go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade, indicating that political strategy is overriding economics.</p>

            <p>Defensive miscues and missed opportunities have plagued the Los Angeles Dodgers, contributing to their recent struggles and three losses in the last four games. In their recent loss to the Nationals, defensive errors cost the Dodgers two runs, while stellar defense from the Nationals prevented potential rallies. Manager Dave Roberts noted the team's failure to play clean baseball, citing extra outs and baserunning blunders. Despite Shohei Ohtani's strong performance, the Dodgers' defensive shortcomings proved to be the deciding factor.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has made it easier for President Trump to deport individuals by tossing out a lower court decision that blocked the use of the Alien Enemies Act. While the Court ruled that individuals must be given notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal, it also stipulated that these challenges must be brought on a person-by-person basis. This decision allows deportations under the Act to resume, although the legality of using the wartime statute remains questionable, as the U.S. is not currently at war.</p>

            <p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are considering changes to the nation's fluoride guidance. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to assemble a task force to stop recommending fluoride, while the EPA is reviewing new science on fluoride. Utah recently became the first state to ban fluoride from drinking water systems. The reviews are based on a report that found lower IQ in children who had higher levels of fluoride exposure, although the American Dental Association maintains that fluoride at recommended levels does not negatively impact IQ.</p>

            <p>China has condemned the latest threat from the United States to further raise tariffs and has pledged to take firm action to stabilize the markets. The Ministry of Commerce stated that China firmly opposes any moves to increase tariffs by the U.S. and will resolutely respond if it does so. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has also indicated it will provide relending support to defend the stability of the capital market. These actions come in response to President Trump's threat to impose an additional 50 per cent duty on Chinese imports.</p>

            <p>Despite China's declaration of a milestone in the South China Sea Code of Conduct (COC) negotiations, observers remain cautious about actual progress on contentious issues. Enforcement mechanisms, geographic scope, legal status, and the role of external powers remain sticking points. The analysis suggests that the diplomatic talk may be a tactic amidst heightened maritime tensions and a war of words between Beijing and the US-led West. The Group of Seven (G7) recently issued a tough statement accusing China of dangerous actions endangering maritime security.</p>

The National Weather Service has warned that dozens of locations are expected to reach major flood stage, and it may take days or weeks for the water to recede in some areas.

            <p>The Trump administration has fired Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee. While no official reason was given, sources suggest it may be related to her support for diversity in the force. The firing is part of a broader effort by the administration to remove leaders who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and to erase DEI programs. Chatfield was targeted by a conservative group that complained about her supportive comments on diversity.</p>
