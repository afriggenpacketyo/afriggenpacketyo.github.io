            <p>Following President Trump's Truth Social post urging investors to buy stocks, the market experienced a significant surge after he rolled back some tariffs.

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily blocked lower court orders that prevented President Trump from firing members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Supreme Court is considering a Justice Department request to allow the removal of Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox, arguing that the orders harm the president's authority.  The Justice Department argues that the president has the power to remove executive officers from independent agencies, citing concerns about the officials' alignment with the administration's policy objectives. The court has given the lawyers for Harris and Wilcox until April 15 to respond.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, except for China, amid growing concerns about the bond market and potential economic fallout. While some hail the move as a strategic maneuver, others view it as damage control after the initial tariff announcement triggered market turmoil. The pause leaves in place a 10% tariff on almost every good imported from non-Putin controlled countries, raising questions about the long-term economic impact.</p>
