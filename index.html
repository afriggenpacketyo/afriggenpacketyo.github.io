The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which began in 2001, achieved a 98% success rate over its lifetime, overcoming an early failure in 2003. Japan's space efforts will now be led by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, designed to compete in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing challenge of youth vaping in the UK, even after a ban on disposable vapes came into effect. It features a mother who, in a desperate attempt to manage her teenagers' addiction, now buys them lower-nicotine vapes herself to control their intake and ensure product safety. Experts from Trading Standards and a specialized NHS youth vaping clinic note that the ban has had limited effect, with some refillable products still being marketed to children. The piece highlights the severity of nicotine addiction in young people and the complex battle parents face against a powerful industry.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered mysterious radio waves originating from a distant galaxy cluster, known as SpARCS1049, that took 10 billion years to reach Earth. These signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. The discovery, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, suggests that the energetic processes shaping galaxy clusters, such as activity from supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, were occurring much earlier in the universe's history than previously thought. This finding opens a new window into the evolution of the early universe.</p>

Although his workload is still being carefully managed as he returns from Tommy John surgery, his performance showcased his dominant potential on the mound.

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chips, a gap that will take years to bridge. However, he highlighted Chinese firms like DeepSeek, which are achieving competitive results with top U.S. models using far less computing power. This suggests China's focus on algorithmic innovation is allowing it to remain highly competitive in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was bitten on the leg and foot while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. State officials believe the bite was from a juvenile sand tiger shark based on analysis of the non-life-threatening injuries. The woman did not see what bit her, and a drone search of the area did not locate any dangerous marine life. Swimming was temporarily suspended at the beach as a precaution but has since resumed after lifeguards checked the water.</p>

This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their family buildings. The findings, which also showed females received significantly more grave goods than males, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in the ancient world.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road. However, when an officer arrived to investigate, they did not find an exotic feline but instead discovered a deceased hawk. The California Department of Transportation was notified to remove the bird. The incident highlights a moment of zoological confusion, as owning tigers is illegal for private citizens in California.</p>
