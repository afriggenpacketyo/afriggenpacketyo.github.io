Missing payments can lead to late fees, increased interest rates, and damage to one's credit score, with the severity increasing at 30, 60, and 90-day delinquency marks. The article recommends taking immediate action by making minimum payments, contacting the credit card company to negotiate, and setting up payment reminders to avoid future issues. The piece further suggests exploring options like balance transfers or personal loans to consolidate debt and aggressively tracking budgets to allocate more funds towards debt repayment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has defended President Donald Trump's approach to Iran, asserting Trump's consistency in preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Vance stated that Trump has encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with Iran to achieve this goal, emphasizing that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. These comments come amid growing divisions among Trump's supporters, with some, like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, opposing U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Vance assures that Trump is only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals.</p>

          <p>Republicans are proposing to eliminate economic hardship and unemployment deferments for federal student loan borrowers. These deferments currently allow borrowers to pause their monthly payments during periods of joblessness or financial difficulties, often without accruing interest. Experts warn that removing these deferments could lead to increased loan defaults, particularly for those facing unexpected financial setbacks. The Trump administration has projected a significant rise in student loan defaults in the coming months if such measures are enacted.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has defended his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs, reversing his earlier stance where he accused those calling for one of jumping on a far-right bandwagon. The inquiry comes after a report highlighted poor data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrators and suggested officials had "shied away" from the issue. Starmer stated that the national inquiry "must go wherever it needs to go, whether that's a question of ethnicity or the role of public officials". The report also calls for adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 to face the most serious charge of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Jurors in Karen Read's retrial have sent questions to the court that suggest they are considering lesser included charges, rather than the top charge of second-degree murder. The questions focus on the timeframe for the operating under the influence (OUI) charge and whether video clips of Karen's interviews are evidence. Legal experts believe these questions are favorable for the defense, indicating the jury is focusing on the role alcohol played in the case. Read is accused of killing her then-boyfriend in a drunken hit-and-run, and her first trial ended in a hung jury.</p>

          <p>Jazwell Brown, 49, has been sentenced to a minimum of 39 years in jail for murdering his partner, Joanne Pearson, and neighbor, Teohna Grant, on Christmas Day while under the influence of drugs. Brown also attempted to murder his son, Jake, and another neighbor, Bradley Latter, who both survived the attacks. The court heard that Brown attacked Ms. Pearson after she refused to hand over a crack pipe, and his son described the scene as "like watching a horror film". Brown expressed remorse for his actions, but the families of the victims stated that the pain will never go away.</p>

Kraft Heinz has already replaced artificial dyes in some products, such as Kraft Mac & Cheese, and many of its products never contained dyes. The FDA is working to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026 through voluntary efforts from the food industry.</p>
