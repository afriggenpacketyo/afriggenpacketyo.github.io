          <p>Reform UK, currently leading in national polls, is advocating for the immediate resumption of fracking in the UK, urging energy companies to prepare for extraction if the party forms the next government. Deputy leader Richard Tice emphasizes the financial negligence of leaving vast shale gas reserves underground, proposing a two-year testing period to confirm viability and safety without public investment. However, the article highlights significant historical obstacles, including environmental concerns, minor earthquakes, and persistent political opposition that led to previous bans and the downfall of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Experts remain skeptical about the economic competitiveness of British shale gas against imports and the likelihood of public acceptance, noting the complex geology and limited space compared to the US.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's Dongfeng Motor Group surged by over 57% on Monday, hitting eight-year highs, after its state-owned parent announced plans to take the automaker private, valuing the company at approximately $7 billion. This strategic move aligns with China's State Council's broader efforts to consolidate the automotive sector and enhance its global competitiveness. The Wuhan-based company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong, signaling a focus on the burgeoning EV market. Despite reporting a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries for the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models, including VOYAH, climbed significantly by 33%.

The high-level meeting commemorated 65 years of diplomatic relations, with both officials emphasizing their strong friendship and shared goals for national security. Chen articulated China's readiness to work with Cuba to follow through on important mutual understandings reached by President Xi Jinping and Cuban leader Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermúdez, aiming to safeguard social stability and advance a "China-Cuba community with a shared future." This announcement follows months after the US expressed jitters regarding China's perceived intelligence activities in Cuba, adding a layer of geopolitical context to the deepened alliance.</p>

The flight plan included the Super Heavy booster splashing down in the Gulf and the Starship upper stage, deploying Starlink simulator satellites, performing an in-space engine restart before splashing down in the Indian Ocean. The development of this mega-rocket is crucial for Elon Musk's Mars ambitions and NASA's Artemis moon landing program, which requires numerous successful flights for in-orbit refueling.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged over 2% on Monday, nearing a four-year high, driven by a robust tech rally and positive sentiment from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent dovish speech. Powell's remarks, signaling potential monetary policy easing as early as next month, boosted investor confidence across Asian markets. The Hang Seng Tech index saw significant gains, with Nio rising 14.73% and semiconductor manufacturer ASMPT adding 6.74%. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended its gains for the fourth consecutive session, reaching a 37-month high. Analysts from Goldman Sachs anticipate potential inflows from maturing time deposits shifting into equities and capital rotation from the US to China, sustaining the market's upward momentum.

          <p>Angry confrontations erupted across Britain between opponents and supporters of migrants, following a court order forcing a London suburb hotel to evict asylum-seekers, intensifying a national debate. This ruling has created a significant challenge for the government, which is struggling with curbing unauthorized migration and fulfilling its legal obligation to accommodate those seeking refuge. In response, the government announced plans to speed up asylum appeals, potentially leading to more deportations and clearing a backlog of cases. The issue has become a major political flashpoint, with politicians like Nigel Farage linking migration to national problems, while others warn against inflammatory rhetoric, fearing further social unrest and potential violence.</p>

          <p>China’s central bank has set the yuan’s daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, reaching 7.1161 per US dollar. This significant upward adjustment, the largest since January, directly follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks at the closely watched Jackson Hole conference. Powell signaled a potential interest rate cut in September, a shift from his previous stance, which has intensified market bets on easing monetary policy. Consequently, the offshore yuan climbed to its strongest level since late July, and the US dollar index fell to a four-week low. Economists now believe a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve is almost certain, with attention turning to the future pace and scale of easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK newspaper front pages feature several key stories, including allegations that the Trump administration is preventing Ukraine from firing long-range US-made missiles into Russia to push for negotiations. Ukrainian President Zelensky, however, downplayed these restrictions, citing Ukraine's own long-range weapon development. Another prominent story is the upcoming memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault, promising "intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking details" from the book completed before her death. Additionally, polls suggest public concern over Sir Keir Starmer's handling of asylum seekers in hotels, while the Daily Star celebrates a rain-free August Bank Holiday forecast.</p>

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency as its infant mortality rate surged to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average and its highest in over a decade. This crisis disproportionately affects Black infants, who are more than twice as likely to die. The state's plan includes expanding prenatal services, creating regional obstetric care, and strengthening community health programs. Experts warn that federal funding cuts to maternal and infant health programs, alongside Mississippi's non-expansion of Medicaid, could exacerbate the issue, limiting access to crucial care and destabilizing rural hospitals in "OB deserts."</p>
