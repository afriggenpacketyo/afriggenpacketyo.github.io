          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, delivered a dominant 69-17 thrashing of the United States, playing before a record-breaking crowd of 42,723, the largest ever for a Women's Rugby World Cup match. Ellie Kildunne, the reigning World Player of the Year, was instrumental with two tries and two assists, showcasing her dazzling skills and confirming her status as a tournament highlight. While the team celebrated its 28th consecutive victory and a strong start, head coach John Mitchell highlighted areas needing refinement, such as midfield passing and defensive intensity, preparing for more challenging opponents ahead. This impressive performance signals England's formidable presence and ambition in the ongoing tournament, setting a high bar for their rivals.</p>

          <p>A tour bus returning from a trip to Niagara Falls tragically overturned on Interstate 90 in Pembroke, Upstate New York, resulting in at least four fatalities and dozens of injuries, with some passengers ejected or trapped. Law enforcement sources confirmed the deaths, including at least one child, as rescue operations continued. The bus, carrying 52 people, mostly of Indian, Chinese, or Filipino descent, lost control for unknown reasons, veered into the median, over-corrected, and ultimately landed in a ditch. This serious accident prompted a large emergency response, including multiple medical helicopters, and led to the closure of eastbound lanes on the thruway, causing significant delays.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard issued a controversial directive, prohibiting U.S. intelligence agencies from sharing information regarding Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations with "Five Eyes" partners, which include the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The memo designated this intelligence as "NOFORN," severely limiting its dissemination to only the originating agencies, though a DNI spokesperson later publicly refuted the reporting as false. This unprecedented move has raised significant concerns among former intelligence officials, who warn it could severely undermine crucial alliances and erode trust among partners accustomed to open exchanges. Conversely, some argue that such restrictions are a common practice when national interests diverge, downplaying the "faux outrage."</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and divers have successfully retrieved ancient artifacts, including a sphinx statue and Roman coins, from the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Abu Qir Bay near Alexandria, Egypt. These historic treasures date back over 2,000 years to a sunken city, believed to be an extension of ancient Canopus, which thrived during the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman Empire. The consistent damage to the statues, notably missing heads and feet, is attributed by experts to a major natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami, indicating the city's sudden demise. This significant discovery not only enriches understanding of Alexandria's deep historical past but also underscores the ongoing challenges the modern city faces from rising sea levels.</p>

Simultaneously, over 600 employees were officially let go, dismantling critical public health programs like global HIV prevention, maternal and child health services, and violence against children surveys. The agency also announced a new panel, chaired by an outspoken vaccine critic, to review mRNA vaccine safety, which many employees view as a concession to disinformation narratives and a profound blow to scientific integrity.</p>

The Hypernova glasses will feature a small digital display in the right lens, primarily for simple information like text messages, and are expected to cost around $800, sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The wristband, utilizing CTRL Labs technology, will allow gesture-based control, serving as a key input component for future full AR glasses. While Meta has low sales expectations for Hypernova due to its increased weight and thickness, this launch marks a significant step in the company's ambitious push into augmented reality wearables.</p>

ESPN will gain a brand-new package worth $550 million, encompassing MLB TV, in-market games for five local teams, and a new midweek national game package. These agreements are seen as beneficial for MLB, fostering new partnerships and potentially enhancing both monetary returns and broader audience reach in a shifting media landscape.</p>

While a company's stock rarely drops so dramatically over a logo redesign, marketing experts highlighted the inherent risk of alienating the chain's deeply loyal, long-time fan base.

          <h2>Defense Secretary Fires DIA Director Over Iran Strike Assessment That Angered Trump</h2>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), reportedly due to the agency's initial intelligence assessment of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The DIA's preliminary report, which concluded that Iran's program was set back only a few months, directly contradicted President Trump's assertion that the Iranian program was "completely and totally obliterated." This action marks the latest in a series of upheavals within U.S. military and intelligence agencies, with Senator Mark Warner criticizing the administration's "dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test." The firing underscores ongoing tensions and perceived politicization of intelligence within the Trump administration, leading to instability in leadership.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison where he alleges torture, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is now returning to Maryland, where he previously lived with his family. A federal judge ruled that immigration authorities are prohibited from detaining him upon release, reinstating a 2019 supervision order that allowed him to live and work in Maryland. Abrego Garcia's attorneys accuse federal prosecutors of "vindictive and selective prosecution" in the human smuggling charges he faces, arguing the government targeted him for not acquiescing to due process violations. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem criticized the release, calling it a "new low" by "activist liberal judges" and vowing to continue seeking his removal from the country.</p>

          <h2>Three Factors That Can Reduce Your Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 17:01:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security, but many are unaware that their benefits can be reduced by factors beyond early claiming. Continuing to work before full retirement age can trigger the earnings test, temporarily reducing benefits if income exceeds certain thresholds. Medicare Part B premiums, automatically deducted, can significantly shrink payments, with high-income earners facing steeper Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA). Furthermore, Social Security benefits can be subject to federal income tax if combined income exceeds specific levels, surprising many retirees. Understanding these pitfalls is crucial for retirement planning, with options like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities available to supplement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Criticizes Smithsonian's Focus on Slavery, Advocates for "Unifying" Historical Narratives</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump criticized the Smithsonian Institution for its focus on "how bad slavery was," advocating instead for "unifying and constructive descriptions" of American history. This directive, supported by his administration, aims to micro-manage museum exhibits and replace historical truth with a positive, unblemished narrative, potentially erasing uncomfortable aspects like slavery and the civil rights movement. Critics argue this deliberate whitewashing insults Black and Indigenous Americans and fundamentally prevents a true understanding of the present by distorting the past. The move raises significant concerns about censorship, the weaponization of history, and the erosion of truth in public institutions, fostering division rather than unity.</p>

          <p>The FBI raided the Maryland home and office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, reportedly investigating whether he mishandled or shared classified material. President Trump, who has publicly called Bolton a "lowlife" and denied knowledge of the raid, has a long-standing contentious relationship with him. The investigation reportedly followed intelligence collected overseas by the CIA, adding a layer of international intrigue. This development adds to Bolton's history of disputes, including his memoir published without full government clearance and the recent removal of his security detail due to credible Iranian threats. While Bolton is known for his meticulous nature, the raid highlights the intense scrutiny surrounding him and the broader issue of classified information handling within high-level political circles.</p>

          <p>California and Texas are embroiled in an intense, mid-decade redistricting battle that could significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas Republicans redrew maps to create five new congressional seats favoring their party, prompting California Democrats to counter by redrawing their own districts to boost Democratic representation by five seats. This political "arms race" for partisan advantage, while legal unless ruled racially motivated, is unusual for occurring mid-decade and explicitly acknowledged by lawmakers. The Supreme Court's 2019 ruling against federal courts blocking political gerrymandering means the fight will likely intensify across other states ahead of next year's national midterm elections, creating political instability.</p>

          <p>Wall Street saw a significant surge after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts during his Jackson Hole address, causing the Dow to climb over 800 points. However, Powell also cautioned that the neutral interest rate might be higher than in the 2010s, implying rates may not return to pre-pandemic lows. This long-term instability means borrowing costs, like mortgages, could remain elevated, impacting housing affordability. The Fed is navigating a "curious kind of balance" in the labor market and observing the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs, setting the stage for a potential rate cut as early as next month despite broader economic uncertainties.

Infrastructure, such as munitions storage containers, is beginning to appear on completed reefs. This development intensifies overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, where China asserts sovereignty over almost the entire area, and comes despite a 2016 international ruling against China's claims.</p>

          <p>Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, renowned for riding the legendary Secretariat to horse racing's Triple Crown in 1973, has died at the age of 84 from natural causes. Turcotte's historic achievement with Secretariat, including the iconic 31-length victory in the Belmont Stakes, ended a 25-year Triple Crown drought and set a record that still stands 52 years later. His illustrious career, spanning nearly two decades and over 3,000 wins, tragically ended in 1978 after an accident left him paraplegic. Remembered for his humility, strength, and dedicated advocacy for fallen riders, Turcotte's legacy as a "true Canadian icon" and one of the sport's greatest champions is considered immeasurable.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, in a two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, denied the existence of any "client list" or blackmail scheme connected to Jeffrey Epstein's illicit activities. She explicitly stated she never witnessed or heard of inappropriate or criminal behavior by high-profile associates, including former Presidents Donald Trump or Bill Clinton, whom she described as cordial and extraordinary figures, respectively. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for aiding Epstein, steadfastly maintained her innocence regarding the sexual exploitation of minors, claiming she only introduced Epstein to adult women for massages and never saw underage individuals involved. This extensive interview, conducted under limited immunity and subsequently released by the DOJ, aimed to address persistent public demands for transparency surrounding Epstein's powerful network and the broader scope of his crimes.</p>
