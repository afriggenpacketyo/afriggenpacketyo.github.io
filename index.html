            <p>Canada has implemented a 25% tariff on specific vehicle imports from the United States in retaliation for similar measures imposed by the US. Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne stated that this action is a response to "unwarranted and unreasonable" tariffs. The tariffs will affect Canadians purchasing certain automobiles or their parts from the US, specifically targeting vehicles not compliant with the CUSMA North American free-trade agreement or those containing non-Canadian/Mexican content. This move follows Prime Minister Mark Carney's pledge to respond forcefully to Trump's tariffs, highlighting the escalating trade tensions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Investor confidence in the US economy is declining as government debt is being sold off due to concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The interest rate on US bonds has risen sharply, reflecting increased borrowing costs for the US. Sweeping taxes on imported goods from around 60 countries have taken effect, and a trade war between the US and China is intensifying.

            <p>Thousands of drug tests conducted in California prisons by Quest Diagnostics are suspected of producing false positive results, potentially affecting parole decisions. The issue stemmed from the use of an alternative reagent in urine opiate screenings, leading to a significant spike in positive test rates. Civil rights lawyers and prison medical experts are calling for a review of medical records and parole board decisions that may have been influenced by the inaccurate tests. This situation highlights concerns about the reliability of drug tests used in prisons and their impact on incarcerated individuals' chances of release.</p>

            <p>The United States' dominance in science is being threatened by funding cuts and restrictive immigration policies implemented by the Trump administration. These actions are undermining the country's ability to attract and retain scientific talent, potentially leading to a decline in innovation and economic growth. The administration's targeting of foreign students and the withholding of resources from research projects are causing significant damage to the scientific workforce. This situation could result in other countries taking the lead in vital fields such as biotechnology and AI, ultimately diminishing America's global standing.</p>

While maintaining its first-quarter sales outlook, Walmart's decision reflects growing concerns among major US companies about the economic impact of the tariffs. The company also cited insurance-related costs and a less favorable merchandise mix as contributing factors. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As Trump's tariffs trigger a sell-off in US Treasuries, investors are turning to German bonds as a safe haven. The yield on German 10-year bunds decreased, while yields on US Treasury bonds spiked, reflecting concerns about the US economy and the escalating trade war. The move highlights a shift in investor sentiment, with some questioning the traditional safe-haven status of US Treasuries. This situation is reminiscent of the UK's 2022 "mini budget" crisis, raising concerns about potential financial instability. (not investment advice)</p>

Using Opta's expected goals (xG) model, the probability of scoring both free-kicks was calculated at a mere 0.23%. While one pundit praised the second free-kick as a "perfect" shot, the article delves into the debate of whether the goalkeeper could have done more to prevent the goals. The analysis explores the technical aspects and the element of chance involved in these set-piece moments.</p>
