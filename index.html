          <p>Eastern Australia is facing severe flooding, resulting in four deaths and one missing person as record floodwaters inundate the region. Approximately 50,000 people have been isolated along the New South Wales coast north of Sydney following days of heavy rainfall. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and New South Wales Premier Christopher Minns have been inspecting the devastated communities, praising emergency services for rescuing hundreds from the floodwaters. Despite the easing rain, authorities remain vigilant for potential rises in water levels due to continued flow into catchments, with landslides and damaged infrastructure complicating recovery efforts.</p>

Services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which were suspended on a section running near the loop line, had fully resumed.

          <p>A decision by the Trump administration to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could significantly impact the university's sports teams. The Department of Homeland Security cited an unsafe campus environment due to antisemitism as the reason for the revocation, which could affect as many as 6,800 foreign students. Harvard is challenging the action, calling it unlawful, and is working to provide guidance to affected students. Several sports teams, such as men's heavyweight crew, men's hockey, and men's squash, have a substantial number of international players who would be impacted by this policy.</p>

This shift highlights BYD's growing influence in the European EV market, despite significant tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. Overall, BEV sales in Europe accounted for 17% of new car registrations in April, up from 13.4% the previous year, with Chinese carmakers driving much of this growth.

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to pause in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, after facing heavy criticism. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially halted on-site classes, citing that the government would no longer pay for travel for programs deemed not "mission critical." However, FEMA later stated that a comprehensive review found that certain courses provide effective training, restoring in-person programs at the academy and other related institutions.
