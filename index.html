        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in Northern Ireland have decided not to assist in the removal of a large bonfire in south Belfast, citing safety risks. The bonfire, part of the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, raised concerns due to its proximity to a major electricity substation supplying two hospitals and the presence of asbestos. Despite a council request for intervention, authorities concluded that dismantling the structure posed a greater danger than allowing it to proceed, though discussions to reduce its size are ongoing. The decision has drawn criticism from some local politicians who point to political failure in managing the contentious tradition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon has terminated numerous warehouse workers, many of whom are Haitian immigrants, after the Trump administration ended a Biden-era humanitarian parole program. This policy change revoked the temporary legal status and work authorization for individuals from countries like Haiti, Cuba, and Venezuela. Affected employees, who had been working legally in the U.S., now face unemployment and an uncertain future, including the risk of deportation, while trying to secure alternative legal statuses. The terminations occurred just before Amazon's major Prime Day sales event, highlighting the reliance of large employers on immigrant labor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the enforcement of the Trump administration's executive order concerning birthright citizenship. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of immigrant families. U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante stated that the challengers were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was not halted. This decision represents a significant legal victory for opponents of the policy, which sought to challenge the constitutionally established right to citizenship for all individuals born in the United States.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the nation faces a rising, persistent, and unpredictable threat from Iran, encompassing espionage, cyber attacks, and physical threats. The report from the Intelligence and Security Committee highlights a sharp increase in assassination and kidnapping attempts against opponents of the Iranian regime living in the UK. It criticizes the government for focusing on crisis management rather than a comprehensive long-term strategy. The committee urges the government to consider proscribing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization and to prioritize nuclear de-escalation efforts.</p>

          <p>A recent memo from the Department of Justice and the FBI has confirmed that Jeffrey Epstein victimized more than one thousand people, a number far exceeding previous official allegations. The review also reaffirmed that Epstein's death was a suicide and stated that no incriminating "client list" was found among his effects. Investigators noted that much of the unreleased case material pertains to minors and contains sensitive information, including illegal child sexual assault material, which will not be made public to protect victims. This new figure highlights the vast scale of Epstein's decades-long sex trafficking operation.</p>

Even for eligible patients, limited insurance adoption and high costs compared to generic opioids create major hurdles.

The author suggests Netanyahu is exploiting Trump's desire for recognition to deflect pressure for a ceasefire and maintain his own political power, thereby avoiding potential elections and a corruption trial. The piece contends that the nomination is absurd, given the ongoing conflict and the U.S. role as Israel's primary weapons supplier.

          <p>This article explores the cultural phenomenon of grocery stores like Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and H-E-B cultivating fanatical followings, transforming them from utilitarian spaces into powerful brands. Anthropologists and marketing experts suggest this trend reflects a broader shift where consumer behavior has replaced other forms of community and identity signaling. Stores achieve this by catering to specific regional, cultural, or lifestyle identities, making shopping an expression of personal values. The intense loyalty, seen in viral product crazes and long opening-day lines, shows how consumption has become a primary way people build community and define themselves.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final after a stunning victory over world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the Wimbledon semi-finals. The 13th seed won the thrilling three-set match 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in a grueling contest on Centre Court. This marks a significant career milestone for Anisimova, who took a seven-month break from tennis in 2023 for her mental health. For Sabalenka, the defeat is another major disappointment, denying her a spot in what would have been her fourth consecutive Grand Slam final.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas, false claims blaming the disaster on cloud seeding have circulated widely on social media. Meteorologists and weather experts have firmly stated there is zero evidence to support this connection, explaining that the weather modification technique is not powerful enough to create or significantly contribute to such a massive storm system. The deluge was actually caused by a convergence of storms with remnants of a tropical storm. A small cloud seeding operation did occur 150 miles away two days prior, but experts confirm it dissipated within hours and had no impact on the flood.</p>

          <p>The federal tax credits for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, are set to expire on September 30, a change enacted by President Trump's recent major spending bill. Analysts predict this abrupt deadline will trigger a summer rush for consumers to purchase or lease an EV to capitalize on the savings before they disappear. Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to act quickly. To be eligible, consumers must take possession of the vehicle by the deadline, creating a sense of urgency that dealers will likely leverage with additional incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

The tomb, dating to around A.D. 350, was located beneath another royal burial and contained the ruler's remains along with pottery, a jadeite death mask, and other valuable artifacts.

          <p>President Trump's recent comment praising Liberian President Joseph Boakai for his "good English" has drawn attention to the deep historical connections between the United States and Liberia. The West African nation was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, often spoken with an American accent. This shared heritage is reflected in Liberia's flag, its capital Monrovia being named after a U.S. president, and its long-standing cultural and political ties. While some Liberians were not offended, the incident sparked a broader conversation about global perceptions of African nations.</p>
