          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana following a judge's order, after spending months in custody due to "foreign policy" concerns under the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder, was initially detained in March, causing separation from his pregnant wife and newborn son. The judge determined Khalil was not a flight risk or threat, criticizing the government's justification for his detention as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech. While the White House plans to appeal, Khalil's wife and the ACLU expressed relief at his release and return home to his family.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles and accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent protesters and endangering law enforcement due to the city's sanctuary status.

He incorrectly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "José Padilla" while criticizing Democratic lawmakers' actions. Newsom's office responded by criticizing Vance's visit and accusing him of staging a photo op while misnaming a Latino U.S. Senator.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Lime e-bikes have been dumped in rivers and canals across England, raising concerns about pollution and flooding. The Canal and River Trust reports spending thousands of pounds retrieving the bikes, with Nottingham being a particular hotspot.

Local groups and council members are working to address the issue, suggesting solutions like docking bays to prevent thefts and dumping.</p>

While some companies allow employees to dress comfortably and professionally, others maintain stricter standards, especially for client-facing roles. Stylists suggest that context is crucial, and employees should observe their colleagues' attire to determine if shorts are acceptable.

Despite ongoing Israeli airstrikes and a U.S. military buildup, discussions focused on Iran's nuclear program and the possibility of direct talks with the U.S. While U.S. expectations for a breakthrough are low, several countries have offered to host negotiations, and the U.S. has expressed readiness for direct talks with Iranian counterparts.

The surge in sales is driven by women under 35, and the community is strong, with readers buying multiple editions of their favorite books. Despite commercial growth, critical appraisal of the genre is still lacking, with few broadsheets reviewing romance books.</p>

The judge determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or threat to the community, and his arrest sparked demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests, was held under two charges, including a claim by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his presence could pose adverse foreign policy consequences.

The court's ruling backs an order issued by a U.S. District Judge, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law, but the court disagreed. The Louisiana Attorney General said she disagreed and believed the ruling only applied to school districts in the five parishes that were party to the lawsuit and that she would seek to appeal the ruling.</p>
