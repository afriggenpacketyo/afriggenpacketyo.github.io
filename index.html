          <p>Hong Kong authorities have issued arrest warrants and offered substantial bounties for 19 pro-democracy activists currently living overseas, accusing them of violating the national security law. The activists are linked to the "Hong Kong Parliament," a Canada-based group that advocates for self-determination and is considered a subversive organization by Beijing. Police have offered rewards up to 1 million Hong Kong dollars for information leading to the arrest of key figures, marking the fourth time such bounties have been used under the controversial law. This action underscores China's ongoing crackdown on political dissent in the city, drawing criticism from Western nations.</p>

          <p>German sportswear company Puma experienced a significant drop in its share price, plunging as much as 18%, after drastically cutting its full-year sales and profit guidance for 2025. The company attributed the revised negative outlook primarily to the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, which are expected to cause an €80 million hit to its gross profit. In response to ongoing market volatility and internal challenges, Puma now anticipates a low-double-digit sales decline and an operating loss for the year, a stark reversal from its previous forecasts of growth and profit.

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart is spearheading a new wave of Chinese consumer brands aiming for a significant global presence, driven by the international popularity of its Labubu dolls. The company's CEO, Wang Ning, stated a new ambition to become "the world's Pop Mart," shifting from an earlier goal of being "China's Disney." Revenue from outside mainland China surged by over 375% last year, and overseas sales are projected to surpass domestic sales this year. This success reflects a broader strategic shift in China from merely exporting products to establishing and promoting its own globally recognized brands.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a historic free trade agreement (FTA) projected to boost their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually in the long term. The deal, finalized after three years of negotiations, will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and alcohol. Under the agreement, 99% of Indian goods exported to the U.K. will be tariff-free, while 92% of British exports to India will see duties removed or reduced. This landmark pact between the world's fifth and sixth largest economies is expected to enhance economic growth and strengthen their strategic positions in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike, marking the twelfth walkout in a protracted dispute with the government over pay. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to minimize disruption, instructing hospitals to cancel treatments only in exceptional circumstances, a shift from previous strikes that focused solely on emergency care. The British Medical Association (BMA) warns this approach could stretch staff too thin, while arguing that doctors' pay has fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008. The strike proceeds after talks on non-pay issues broke down, with the government stating pay is not negotiable.</p>

          <p>The Tour de France Femmes continues to highlight significant disparities between men's and women's professional cycling, particularly in prize money and salaries. The female winner of the Tour receives just €50,000, a tenth of the men's €500,000 prize, a gap that top riders like Demi Vollering find disappointing. While race director Marion Rousse defends the structure by comparing it to shorter men's races, the salary gap remains vast, with top male cyclists earning millions more than their female counterparts. Despite progress, such as the introduction of a minimum wage, the article notes a long road remains to achieve financial parity in the sport.</p>

While the government's official stance is to recognize Palestine when it can have the greatest impact, Starmer is navigating calls from within his party and from allies to align with other European nations that have already taken the step to advance a two-state solution.</p>

According to financial experts and former senior prosecutor Anne Brorhilker, these schemes exploit a legal loophole related to dividend tax refunds on loaned shares and persist despite being public knowledge. The fraud involves foreign institutions lending German shares to domestic ones to claim tax refunds they aren't entitled to, with the profits then split. Critics argue that a lack of specialized investigators, inadequate resources, and successful lobbying by the financial industry prevent effective prosecution and legislative closure of the loophole.</p>

The vote is seen as a significant political test of whether anti-Beijing sentiment remains a dominant force in Taiwanese politics.

The analysis also dismisses the notion that a lack of dunking holds the league back, highlighting the WNBA's strong fundamentals and high-level passing game.

          <p>NASA is experiencing significant internal turmoil, with hundreds of current and former employees signing a letter protesting "rapid and wasteful changes" at the space agency. The letter, known as the Voyager Declaration, criticizes proposed budget cuts, non-strategic staffing reductions, and the cancellation of missions, arguing these actions undermine NASA's mission and defy congressional appropriations. This unrest comes as the agency operates with an interim administrator, faces high-level departures, and navigates a reduced budget, which could see further cuts under the Trump administration's proposals to shrink the federal workforce.

          <p>Organizers of the Tour de France have been forced to shorten and reroute Stage 19 of the race to avoid a herd of cattle affected by contagious nodular dermatitis. The decision was made after an outbreak was discovered on the Col des Saisies, one of the planned climbs. To prevent any risk and out of respect for the affected farmers, the stage was cut from 130km to 95km, bypassing two climbs. The race will now start an hour later than originally scheduled, with riders rejoining the original route after the affected area, as the three-week event nears its conclusion in Paris.</p>

          <p>The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached a critical stage, with international aid organizations reporting widespread starvation and a severe lack of essential supplies after 21 months of conflict. Displaced Palestinians describe a daily struggle for food, with prices for basic goods like flour soaring to unaffordable levels. According to the UN, a significant portion of the population is starving, and medical facilities are unable to cope with malnutrition-related illnesses. Despite some aid entering the territory, humanitarian groups state it is vastly insufficient to meet the population's needs, leading to desperation and dangerous conditions for those seeking assistance.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will formally recognize Palestine as a state, with the formalization planned for the United Nations General Assembly in September. This significant diplomatic move is intended to advance a just and sustainable peace in the Middle East amid the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority has welcomed the decision, while Israel has strongly condemned it as a "reward for terror," and the United States has also rejected the plan. France's action adds to the international pressure on Israel and follows similar recognitions by other European nations, reinforcing the push for a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Football Association (FA) chief executive Mark Bullingham has stated that there is no need to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in football. Responding to reports that the sport's law-making body, Ifab, might consider using VAR for decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards, Bullingham argued that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the game. The FA, which holds a vote on Ifab, has made its opposition clear, signaling that any proposal to widen VAR's scope would likely face resistance from key stakeholders who believe the current balance is appropriate.</p>

          <p>This article provides reviews for several new films, with a focus on Marvel's 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps.' Directed by Matt Shakman of "WandaVision" fame, the movie is praised for its 1960s kitsch aesthetic and for being a self-contained story that doesn't rely on prior MCU knowledge. The review highlights the convincing CGI depiction of the cosmic entity Galactus and well-filmed, non-excessive action sequences. Also reviewed are Kiyoshi Kurosawa's psychological thriller "Cloud," about an online reseller's descent into paranoia, and Giovanni Tortorici's debut feature "Diciannove," a frustrating yet faithful portrayal of teenage confusion and identity.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to combat an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that infects livestock. The rapid spread of the fly, whose larvae infest open wounds, has caught many in the state of Chiapas off guard and led the United States to bar Mexican cattle imports over contamination fears. While a U.S.-supported plant to produce sterile flies for eradication is under construction, it won't be ready until next year, leaving ranchers to face soaring medicine prices and resort to home remedies. The outbreak affects not only cattle but also sheep, pigs, and domestic pets.</p>

          <p>In a UK first, people in Wales with conditions like coeliac disease will receive pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining food on prescription from a pharmacy. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving individuals more choice and flexibility to buy approved items at supermarkets, shops, and online. While the move is praised for its convenience, some participants from a pilot scheme noted that the allotted funds only scratch the surface of the higher costs associated with a mandatory gluten-free diet.</p>

The visit has drawn criticism for its timing, as it occurs amid major global conflicts and domestic political issues.

Israel also recalled its negotiators following Hamas's response. The breakdown stalls efforts to implement a 60-day ceasefire that would have involved a hostage-prisoner exchange and increased aid to Gaza, prolonging the 21-month conflict and deepening the region's severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

He believes the team is close to turning a corner, citing improved defensive depth and talent as key areas of progress. Despite a decline in wins over his first three seasons, Riley expressed confidence that the program has momentum, pointing to the nation's top-ranked 2026 recruiting class.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly expanded the U.S. military's role at the southern border, tripling troop deployments to 7,600 and designating large areas as militarized zones. Under new rules, troops are empowered to apprehend migrants for trespassing on military-controlled land, working closely with Border Patrol to deter illegal crossings. The mission utilizes armored vehicles, helicopters, and drones from a new command center in Arizona. This shift, occurring despite a 60-year low in border apprehensions, sidesteps the Posse Comitatus Act and has raised concerns among legal experts about the military's involvement in civilian law enforcement.</p>
