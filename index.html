        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Defense Department is evaluating the possibility of assigning up to 600 military attorneys as temporary immigration judges to address the significant backlog of cases in immigration courts. This proposal follows the Trump administration's decision to ease job requirements for these temporary positions, allowing a broader range of government lawyers to qualify. The American Immigration Lawyers Association has voiced concerns, emphasizing the complexity of immigration law and the need for specialized expertise. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has also suggested using National Guard troops as immigration judges, which legal experts consider unprecedented, with the Justice Department potentially covering the costs and providing training. </p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, was found guilty of orchestrating the murder of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel, a Florida State University law professor. Markel was killed in 2014 amid a bitter custody battle between him and Adelson's daughter. Prosecutors argued that Adelson orchestrated the murder to allow her daughter and grandchildren to move closer to the family in South Florida, with Adelson's son, Charles Adelson, already serving a life sentence for his involvement in the crime. Ruth Markel, Daniel Markel's mother, expressed profound grief over her son's death and the decade-long saga. </p>

          <p>President Trump finalized a trade deal with Japan, implementing 15% baseline tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos, after months of negotiations. As part of the agreement, Japan will invest $550 billion in U.S. projects and increase purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment. The deal aims to provide market access in manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, and automobile sectors. The finalizing of the deal coincides with growing political pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, with reports indicating internal discontent within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party following recent election losses.

He alleges that these suspensions have occurred five times over eight years, resulting in significant financial losses for his legal practice. Zuckerberg's lawsuit argues that Meta, Facebook's parent company, breached its contract by improperly taking down advertising he paid for. Facebook has since reinstated his account, acknowledging the error and promising to prevent future occurrences. </p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has reached an estimated $1.7 billion after no one won the top prize, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history. The article analyzes Powerball data to determine where winners can take home the most and least after taxes, as well as the frequency of number draws. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to receive larger sums, while states with higher taxes result in lower after-tax payouts. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, with the next drawing marking a record for consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner. (not investment advice) </p>

          <h2>US Court Rejects Trump Transgender Passport Appeal</h2>

          <p>A US federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing President Trump's policy directive that sought to prevent transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports that accurately reflect their gender identities. The ruling is the latest in a series of cases linked to an executive order signed by Trump, directing the government to only recognize male and female biological genders. The American Civil Liberties Union sued, arguing the policy unlawfully prevented transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people from obtaining passports consistent with their gender identities. The court concluded that Trump's policy reflected unconstitutional animus toward transgender Americans. </p>

          <p>President Trump is set to rebrand the US Department of Defense as the "Department of War," with an executive order allowing it to be used as a secondary title. This change would also allow Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to refer to himself as the "Secretary of War." The move has drawn criticism, with opponents questioning the cost and priorities. The Department of Defense was originally called the War Department until 1949, when it was renamed to reflect a focus on preventing conflict. </p>

          <p>President Trump is directing that the Department of Defense be known as the Department of War. He will sign an executive order on Friday for the defence department to use the new name as a secondary title and for Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to be known as Secretary of War. The BBC has seen the text of the executive order, which says: "The name 'Department of War' conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve compared to 'Department of Defense,' which emphasizes only defensive capabilities." The order also instructs Hegseth to recommend and include legislative and executive actions to move toward a permanent renaming of the department since Trump cannot formally change the name without congressional approval. </p>

The addition of Geyoro, once confirmed by the clubs, would mean London City have made 16 permanent signings during a busy summer in which wealthy American owner Michele Kang showed she was willing to invest in her side. The Lionesses have been able to build a structure from scratch, with a board full of women's football expertise and facilities specifically catered towards women. </p>
