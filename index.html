          <p>A federal judge in Illinois is set to rule on a lawsuit filed by the state and the city of Chicago aiming to block the federal deployment of the National Guard. During the hearing, the judge intensely questioned the government's lawyers about the legal basis and specific scope of the troops' mission, expressing concern over the open-ended nature of the presidential order. The state argued the deployment is an unconstitutional use of military force for domestic law enforcement, while the federal government claimed the president has the authority to protect federal personnel and property amid perceived unrest. The case highlights the ongoing constitutional conflict between state and federal powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's recent diplomatic breakthrough in Gaza, which eluded the previous administration, resulted from a unique combination of factors. The article credits his close, albeit sometimes contentious, relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, which allowed him to exert significant private pressure that past presidents avoided. Furthermore, his established business and political ties with key Gulf states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia were instrumental in securing regional backing and convincing Hamas to agree to the terms. This approach combined personal relationships with an unorthodox, high-pressure style to break the long-standing diplomatic stalemate in the region.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss reported third-quarter profits that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to targeted price increases and a strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer sales. The company's gross margin expanded, and it successfully raised its full-year financial outlook despite broader macroeconomic volatility and tariff costs. CEO Michelle Gass stated that the price hikes have been implemented surgically without negatively impacting consumer demand, a trend the company will monitor closely. This strategy, combined with selling more through its own stores and website, has allowed the denim maker to improve profitability and maintain strong growth momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led a successful civil fraud case against Donald Trump, has been indicted on at least one count of alleged mortgage fraud by a federal grand jury. The indictment follows public demands from President Trump for the Justice Department to prosecute his political adversaries. The case was brought by a U.S. Attorney appointed by Trump after her predecessor was ousted, reportedly for expressing doubts about the strength of the case. Critics argue the prosecution is politically motivated, pointing to the timing and the administration's pressure on the Justice Department to act against figures like James.</p>

          <p>Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell vehemently denied an ESPN report claiming the team had contacted the NFL to monitor low hits on star defensive end Aidan Hutchinson. Calling the report "bogus" and "bull," Campbell asserted that no one from the Lions organization made such a request to the league office. The original report suggested the team was concerned about opponents targeting Hutchinson's legs, particularly after his recovery from a significant leg injury last season.

          <p>President Trump has reportedly met with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to again discuss his potential nomination to lead NASA, months after the president publicly withdrew the initial offer. Trump had previously pulled the nomination citing Isaacman's past political donations and his close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, which he deemed a conflict of interest. However, recent meetings suggest a reconciliation, as the administration seeks a permanent leader for the space agency. The renewed talks come as NASA faces significant challenges, including budget cuts and staffing reductions resulting from a government efficiency initiative that Musk himself had led.</p>

          <p>Belgian authorities have arrested two suspects and foiled a planned terrorist attack that reportedly targeted politicians, including Prime Minister Bart de Wever. The federal prosecutor's office stated there were indications of a jihadist-inspired plot involving an attempted terrorist murder. During searches of the suspects' homes, police discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device and a 3D printer believed to be used for making parts for the attack. The investigation also suggests the suspects intended to build a drone to carry an explosive payload, highlighting the evolving nature of terrorist threats in the country.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. news organizations are refusing to sign new Pentagon media guidelines, arguing the policies are designed to stifle independent reporting and could expose journalists to prosecution for routine newsgathering. A key point of contention is a rule prohibiting the "solicitation" of non-public information from Department of War employees, which journalists fear infringes on their ability to develop sources. Despite minor revisions, the Pentagon Press Association stated the policy still appears designed to suppress a free press. The Trump administration has defended the rules as a necessary regulation of the privilege of Pentagon access, creating a tense standoff over press freedom.</p>

For 2026, the standard deduction will rise for all filing statuses, including for married couples filing jointly, heads of households, and single filers.

Born under Soviet influence, his early novels are soaked in an atmosphere of political terror, yet their themes of anomie and resignation remain timeless.

          <h2>Trump Threatens to Permanently Cut Democratic Programs During Government Shutdown</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that his administration intends to use the ongoing government shutdown as an opportunity to permanently eliminate federal programs that are popular with Democrats. During a Cabinet meeting, he explicitly said, "We're only cutting Democrat programs," framing the move as political retribution and giving his opponents "a little taste of their own medicine." This threat follows earlier actions by the administration to freeze billions in funding for infrastructure and climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states. The statement escalates the political stakes of the funding stalemate, which began after parties failed to agree on appropriations bills.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has returned two larger groups of migrants to France as it ramps up its "one in, one out" agreement, which aims to deter illegal Channel crossings. Under the scheme, the UK can remove individuals who arrive illegally in small boats, and in exchange, it accepts a corresponding number of vetted asylum seekers from France. The recent removal of 19 people brings the total returned to 26, while the UK has accepted 18. The Home Secretary stated the flights send a clear message, though they occurred as the government confirmed over 1,000 migrants crossed the Channel in a single day.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, the election technology company at the center of 2020 election conspiracy theories, has been sold and rebranded as Liberty Vote. The new owner is Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican election official who founded the electronic pollbook company KnowInk. In a statement, the new company announced that "Dominion is gone" and pledged a new chapter focused on rebuilding trust with paper-based transparency, 100% American ownership, and domestic software development. The sale follows years of litigation by Dominion, which secured massive settlements from news outlets like Fox and Newsmax for broadcasting false claims about its equipment.</p>

          <p>Despite the announcement of an Israel-Hamas peace deal, families of hostages who were killed fear there is no guarantee their loved ones' bodies will be returned. The father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old American-Israeli soldier killed on October 7, expressed anxiety over the vague terms regarding the deceased, stating "there's nothing to celebrate yet." Hamas has reportedly told mediators it does not know the location of some bodies, making the 72-hour deadline for their return challenging. This highlights the deep psychological toll on these families, who face a painful waiting game even as others prepare to be reunited with living relatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent conviction of members of the spiritual community OneTaste represents a dangerous misuse of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The author contends that prosecutors wrongly equated psychological influence and persuasion with "forced labor," ignoring a Supreme Court precedent that requires actual force, threats, or abuse of law for a charge of involuntary servitude. The article warns that this sets a dangerous precedent that could be used to target any unpopular religious or spiritual group by rebranding their disciplines or doctrines as "coercive control." The author calls on Congress to amend the law to prevent belief itself from being criminalized.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has accepted paid advisory positions with tech giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic. An independent government watchdog, Acoba, has stipulated that he is barred from lobbying UK ministers on behalf of the companies for two years. During his premiership, Sunak prioritized technology regulation and hosted a major AI safety summit. He stated he will donate his earnings from these new roles to a charity he founded to address numeracy issues in the UK. The appointments come after speculation that Sunak, who still has a home in California, might pursue a career in Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate failed again to advance legislation to end the ongoing government shutdown, with both Republican and Democratic proposals unable to secure the necessary 60 votes. The stalemate persists as Republicans push for a straightforward temporary funding bill, while Democrats insist any deal must include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits and reverse cuts to other programs. Amid the deadlock, President Trump reiterated his threat to use the shutdown to make permanent cuts to programs favored by Democrats. With federal workers facing a missed paycheck, the impasse continues with no clear resolution in sight as both parties hold firm to their demands.</p>

          <p>A personal finance story highlights a family in their early 50s who, despite having over $1.5 million in retirement accounts and a valuable home, are struggling with cash flow and recently took an early 401(k) withdrawal. The stay-at-home mother described the severe anxiety of living paycheck-to-paycheck while being asset-rich, a situation that led them to incur the taxes and penalties of an early withdrawal to cover home repairs. Her decision was influenced by seeing her mother pass away without using her retirement savings and her wealthy father living frugally. The situation sparked a debate about the definition of financial security and the wisdom of prioritizing long-term savings over immediate needs.</p>
