        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert estimates that federal direct undergraduate loan interest rates could slightly decrease to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 academic year, compared to the current 6.53%. Graduate student loans may see a similar drop to 7.94%, and PLUS loans for graduate students and parents could decrease to 8.94%. These rates, set annually by the government, are based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note, which had a high yield rate of 4.34% this year. The article explains how these rates impact monthly payments and overall repayment amounts for borrowers.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, citing increased uncertainty about the economic outlook due to President Trump's trade policies. The Fed acknowledged the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, particularly concerning the potential for stagflation arising from tariffs. The decision reflects a cautious approach as the White House negotiates trade agreements, with the economy showing mixed signals on growth and inflation.

          <p>In his first broadcast interview since leaving the White House, former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. attacked President Trump’s handling of the war in Ukraine and his dealings with global allies. Speaking to the BBC, Mr. Biden also defended the timing of his own withdrawal from the 2024 presidential campaign. Mr. Biden singled out some of Mr. Trump’s actions on foreign policy — including his combative meeting in the Oval Office in February with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and bizarre suggestions to rename the Gulf of Mexico and acquire Greenland. The interview marks a public re-emergence by Mr. Biden, who has kept a relatively low profile since leaving office.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has granted an exemption to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to hire a new class of Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers, averting a potential halving of the program.

The decision comes amid a sweeping federal hiring freeze that has significantly hampered the CDC's ability to add new staff. The article notes that the fate of the program had worried CDC officials, especially with a June 30 start date looming for the incoming officers.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials stated that the upcoming meeting in Switzerland between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart was requested by the Trump administration, with China firmly opposing U.S. tariff hikes. China expressed willingness to participate in a dialogue based on equality, respect, and mutual benefit. However, President Trump disputed China's characterization, and did not answer a question about whether he was still confident that a deal with China could be reached. The article underscores the ongoing tensions and differing narratives surrounding trade negotiations between the two countries.</p>

          <h2>Home Equity Borrowers Face Choice Between HELOC and Home Equity Loan as Interest Rates Pause</h2>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, homeowners considering borrowing against their equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Historically, home equity loans were preferred during rate pauses due to their fixed interest rates, but with potential rate cuts on the horizon, HELOCs may become more attractive due to their variable rates. Currently, HELOC rates are lower than home equity loan rates, offering potential savings, but borrowers must be prepared for fluctuating payments as rates change. The article advises borrowers to carefully compare both options before applying.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates steady could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, but is not guaranteed. Mortgage rates are influenced by a range of factors including inflation trends, economic growth, investor sentiment, and global uncertainty, which are not directly controlled by the Fed. The article advises potential homebuyers and homeowners to improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, consider rate buydowns, and explore different loan types to secure competitive mortgage rates.

          <p>A 61-year-old woman was killed by an alligator while canoeing with her husband on Lake Kissimmee in central Florida. The alligator attacked and tipped the canoe over, and the woman was bitten despite her husband's attempts to intervene. Nuisance alligator trappers were called to the scene and recovered two alligators, one matching the description of the alligator involved in the incident. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) advises people to keep a safe distance from alligators, keep pets on leashes, and avoid swimming in non-designated areas during dusk and dawn.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep the key interest rate steady, defying pressure from President Trump who had been urging them to lower it.

This action is significant as it highlights the central bank's commitment to its mandate, even in the face of political pressure.

Most exploratory expeditions have occurred near the United States, Japan, and New Zealand, leaving vast areas, such as the Indian Ocean, largely unexplored. This limited exploration hinders the ability to map habitats and understand the diverse ecosystems of the deep sea.

          <p>Airstrikes pounded the Gaza Strip, killing dozens, as Israel reaffirmed plans to capture more land and force all two million Gaza residents to live in the south. The single deadliest bombing hit near a cafe in Gaza City, killing 33, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The renewed violence came after Israel announced it was calling up tens of thousands of military reservists to enact the expansion of the war. The displacement of Gazans would protect Israeli forces “against all types of threats,” according to Defense Minister Israel Katz. The plan has prompted a new wave of despair among Palestinian civilians in the territory.</p>

          <p>After a six-month battle, Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin conceded the North Carolina Supreme Court seat to Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. Griffin had attempted to throw out thousands of votes, but a federal court ruling ordered the state elections board to certify Riggs' victory. Two recounts had already affirmed Riggs' win by 734 votes out of over 5.5 million cast. The case tested the boundaries of post-election litigation and drew criticism from democracy watchdog groups, who feared it could set a dangerous precedent.</p>
