          <p>Texas Democratic state legislators have departed for Chicago to prevent a quorum, aiming to halt a Republican-led vote on a new congressional map. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened legal action, citing an attorney general's opinion that could lead to their removal from office. Democrats argue the proposed map is a racist gerrymander designed to solidify Republican power and is being prioritized over disaster relief for recent floods. This act of defiance echoes past quorum breaks by Texas Democrats, highlighting ongoing political tensions over electoral boundaries.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates currently offer higher returns than the inflation rate, making them an attractive savings option. As of August 1, 2025, top 6-month CDs can yield up to 4.45% APY, significantly higher than the national average. Experts recommend considering online banks for better rates due to lower overheads and exploring short-term CDs, given the inverted yield curve where shorter terms often offer higher returns. Laddering CDs can also help investors capitalize on these rates while planning for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have seen significant asset growth, topping $13.74 trillion, attracting investors with lower costs and tax advantages compared to mutual funds. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of a clear ETF investment strategy to navigate market fluctuations. Key recommendations include avoiding trading during market open and close due to high volatility, favoring the less 'frothy' middle hours. Additionally, instead of attempting to time the market, which is often ineffective, investors are advised to use dollar-cost averaging and consider limit orders for more controlled purchases.

Despite these figures, opportunities exist for borrowers with strong credit. Experts suggest strengthening credit profiles and comparing offers from multiple lenders to secure favorable rates. Anticipation of potential Fed rate hike pauses could also offer future relief.

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, marking the latter's first PCC. Matthews, who was re-elected in May 2024, stated that the "dark heart of wokeness" needed to be removed from the criminal justice system, criticizing both Conservative and Labour governments for failing the country. This defection signals a shift in local political energy towards Reform UK and adds to the perception of the Conservative Party fraying at the local level.</p>

          <p>Saving money is crucial for financial emergencies, and high-yield savings accounts currently offer significantly better interest rates than national averages. As of August 1, 2025, top high-yield accounts range from 4.11% to 4.30% APY, far exceeding the FDIC's national average of 0.38%. Experts advise opting for online banks due to their lower overheads, which translate to higher interest rates and fewer fees for consumers. Comparing different accounts is essential to ensure maximum earnings, helping individuals build a stronger financial safety net. (not investment advice)</p>

The core contains ancient air bubbles, allowing researchers to measure past greenhouse gas concentrations and understand the link between the carbon cycle and global temperatures. By extending the climate record beyond 800,000 years, the project aims to improve predictions for Earth's climate response to future greenhouse gas increases. However, current CO2 levels are already much higher than any previous warm periods, primarily due to human activity.</p>

Donated animals are gently euthanized by trained staff before being used as fodder. The zoo emphasizes that this approach ensures nothing goes to waste while supporting the well-being of their predatory animals.</p>
