          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, presenting a significant threat to several Caribbean islands. The National Hurricane Center has warned of "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides for Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic early next week. The storm is expected to bring extreme rainfall, potentially up to 3 feet in some mountainous areas, along with powerful winds reaching 140 mph. While the mainland U.S. is not expected to see major impacts, a hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she might consider another presidential run, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 loss to Donald Trump and reiterated her warnings about his authoritarian tendencies. She did not formally commit to a 2028 campaign but left the possibility open, saying it was a question she is not currently focused on. Recent polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited voter enthusiasm for another attempt.</p>

          <p>A basketball game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Brooklyn Nets was briefly halted when a fan ran onto the court to take a selfie with Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell. The incident occurred late in the fourth quarter, prompting Mitchell to back away before security personnel quickly apprehended and removed the individual. After the game, Mitchell confirmed the fan's intention was to get a photo. Teammate Jarrett Allen praised the Barclays Center security for their swift and effective response to the disruption.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team suffered a significant 26-6 defeat to Australia in the first Ashes match at Wembley, a contest their head coach described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple errors and wasted opportunities, allowing Australia to secure a comfortable victory without reaching their peak performance. Australian full-back Reece Walsh was named player of the match for his decisive contributions. The loss extends Australia's long-standing dominance over England in the sport, with their last defeat in a test series on UK soil occurring 66 years ago.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery after ingesting between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets, resulting in the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, purchased from an online retailer, had clamped together inside his intestines, causing tissue death. Doctors successfully removed the magnetic chains, and the teen was discharged after an eight-day hospital stay. The case highlights the severe danger posed by these small, powerful magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys despite being banned in New Zealand.</p>

          <p>The interstellar object 3I-ATLAS has sparked debate after exhibiting an "anti-tail," a trail of debris appearing to point toward the sun. While most astronomers attribute this to a 3D optical illusion based on our viewing angle, Harvard researcher Avi Loeb has proposed a more controversial theory. He suggests the phenomenon could be a "technosignature" from an alien spacecraft applying "braking thrust" to slow down and remain in our solar system. The object is currently unobservable, and its true trajectory will not be verifiable until it reappears in December.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a decision he linked to a Canadian television ad that was critical of his tariff policies. This move could keep steep tariffs in place on many Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on steel and aluminum. Trade experts warn that prolonging these tariffs could have a direct impact on American consumers, likely leading to increased prices for a range of products that rely on these materials, such as automobiles, auto parts, and home appliances.</p>

This narrative, which emphasizes that the plan was based on Xi's personal inspection tours across the country, serves to reinforce his authority and personal stamp on China's long-term strategic direction.</p>
