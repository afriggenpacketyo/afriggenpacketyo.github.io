        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival, with revenues lower than previous holidays, reflecting the country's struggle to stimulate domestic consumption. Despite this, the Hollywood film "Mission: Impossible â€“ The Final Reckoning" topped ticket presales, outperforming domestic animated features. This comes after Beijing's announcement of a curb on American film imports, seen as retaliation for US tariffs. While China's film market declined last year, observers remain optimistic about its long-term resilience due to improved domestic productions. Optimism remains that the film industry can rebound in the long-term.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that tough choices are unavoidable as the government finalizes spending plans for various sectors, including the NHS, defense, and education. The level of spending on health will determine whether cuts are made to unprotected areas outside the NHS, defense, and schools. The government's commitment to not borrow more money or raise taxes again has led to speculation about spending cuts. The IFS suggests a huge amount depends on the generosity of cash handed to the NHS, which accounts for 39% of day-to-day departmental spending. (not investment advice)</p>

Rising anxiety over U.S. travel is attributed to stricter border controls and negative perceptions of trade and immigration policy.

          <p>The skulls of 19 Black patients, who died in a New Orleans hospital in the 1870s and were sent to Germany for racist phrenological studies, have been repatriated and laid to rest. The University of Leipzig acknowledged the skulls were acquired unethically and returned them to New Orleans. A multi-faith memorial service and jazz funeral honored the deceased, with Dillard University students reading their reconstructed biographies. The repatriation is a significant international restitution, addressing the legacy of racist scientific practices and honoring the lives of those exploited.</p>
