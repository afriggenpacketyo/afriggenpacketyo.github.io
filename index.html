          <p>A volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, just days after a massive magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck the region. The eruption of the Krasheninnikov Volcano prompted an aviation alert as it sent a cloud of ash and gas 27,000 feet into the air. While officials state there is no immediate threat to the sparsely populated area, seismologists are investigating the strong possibility that the powerful earthquake may have triggered the subsequent volcanic activity, providing a rare opportunity to study the connection between these geological events.</p>

Dramatic video captured the moment of impact and the person being thrown into the water, though officials reported the individual is believed to be unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center was alerted to the whale's presence shortly before the collision was reported. The whale's carcass was later found in shallow water, and a necropsy is planned to determine the exact cause of death.</p>

The Palestinian health ministry attributed the incident to Israeli settlers who reportedly set fire to homes and vehicles. This marks the second death of a Palestinian American in the West Bank in three weeks amid escalating violence in the region. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence and confirmed it is providing consular assistance to the family while Israeli police have opened an investigation.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described his performance as "useless" after a challenging Hungarian Grand Prix weekend where he qualified and finished in 12th place. This result came as his Ferrari teammate, Charles Leclerc, secured pole position, highlighting a stark contrast in performance and fueling speculation about Hamilton's form. Despite the frustrating outcome and his downbeat mood, Hamilton reaffirmed his commitment to racing and expressed optimism about the car's recent upgrades. Team principal Frederic Vasseur supported his driver, attributing the poor result to a failed one-stop strategy and expressing confidence in Hamilton's eventual comeback.</p>

This was attempted in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees before the August recess. The requested funds were for various programs, including the National Institutes of Health and the World Food Program. Ultimately, the comprehensive deal fell apart when President Trump rejected the terms, though a smaller number of nominees were confirmed, leaving many others, and the funding, in limbo until September.</p>

          <p>In an effort to block a new congressional map proposed by Republicans, Texas House Democrats are planning to flee the state to break the legislative quorum. The Republican-drawn map could create up to five new GOP seats, and Democrats aim to run out the clock on the 30-day special session by denying the two-thirds majority needed for business. This tactic, which has been used in Texas before, risks fines and potential legal action against the absent lawmakers. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who called for their arrest.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a recent scoring slump to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on manufactured runs rather than power hitting. After struggling offensively for 18 straight innings, the Dodgers broke the deadlock with aggressive baserunning and situational hitting, including key RBI singles from Freddie Freeman. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a winning 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team amid ongoing concerns about its lineup performance.</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are now seeking elected office, motivated by what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, who lack traditional political backgrounds, are running campaigns that openly criticize the administration's actions, such as the dismantling of anti-corruption and civil rights divisions. Figures like Ryan Crosswell in Pennsylvania and Erika Evans in Seattle are leveraging their experience as public servants to argue for a return to the rule of law, representing a new wave of politically active former federal prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning across Canada is causing hazy skies and poor air quality in several U.S. states, including those in the Midwest and Northeast. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, and prevailing winds are pushing smoke south, prompting air quality alerts in states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. Health officials are advising people, especially sensitive groups, to limit outdoor activities due to the pollution. Forecasters predict the weather pattern driving the smoke southward could persist, prolonging the air quality issues.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts estimated to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively high commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion.
