          <p>Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is temporarily suspending shipments to the United States in response to increased tariffs imposed on vehicle imports. The company stated this pause is a short-term measure to address the new trading terms and develop longer-term strategies.

          <p>Experts are raising concerns about the Trump administration's plan to relocate the federal student loan program to the Small Business Administration (SBA), citing potential risks for borrowers.

          <p>The conviction of anti-abortion activist Livia Tossici-Bolt for breaching a Public Spaces Protection Order has ignited a free speech debate, particularly among US supporters. Tossici-Bolt was found guilty of protesting outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth, with her actions deemed to be harassment of women seeking medical treatment. US figures, including JD Vance and the Alliance Defending Freedom, have criticized the conviction, raising concerns about freedom of expression. However, critics argue that the case is about protecting women from harassment, not suppressing free speech.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of magnitude 8 earthquakes in China and surrounding regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. The research, published just before a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, has sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase. The study analyzed 150 years of seismic data to identify major earthquake active periods, correlating them with shifts in the Earth's rotational speed and tectonic stress realignments.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Underdogs," examines the white working class, arguing that their distinctiveness stems more from geography than ethnicity. The book highlights the challenges faced by white workers living outside metropolitan areas, including limited social mobility and lack of opportunities. It also emphasizes the diversity within the white working class, challenging common myths and stereotypes. The author questions the decline of class politics and argues for reclaiming some form of class-based approach to address the issues facing this segment of the population.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the US under President Trump, Britain is urged to forge stronger alliances with Europe, Canada, and other global partners. The article criticizes Trump's protectionist policies and calls for a new global trade order that promotes open and rules-based trade. It suggests that Britain should combine with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to sustain a fair global trading and financial system. It is suggested that Mark Carney, if elected as Canadian PM, could help re-orient Canada around a new global trade order.</p>

          <p>China's PLA aircraft carrier, the Shandong, is believed to have explored an alternative route to Taiwan's east before a drill, a move analysts say was likely training to counter American warships and explore alternative routes in case of conflict. The warship bypassed wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, instead transiting narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. The new route could give the PLA alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific, as well as northbound options through the waterway between Japan and Taiwan.</p>
