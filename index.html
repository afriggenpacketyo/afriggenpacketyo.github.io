          <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concerns about a potential recession due to President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with 69% expecting a downturn and over half predicting it will occur this year. CEOs expressed worries about rising prices, job losses, and boycotts of American brands, with many describing the tariffs as "disappointingly stupid and illogical." The survey highlights the uncertainty and economic pessimism among corporate leaders, who are downsizing building plans and questioning the long-term benefits of the tariffs. The trade policy is causing confusion and anxiety among businesses, leading to a cautious outlook on investment and hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's stronger-than-expected counterpunch to US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff barrage was the tactical result of intensive planning for this scenario amid worsening trade tensions, and of China being less dependent on the American market than when Trump ignited the trade war in 2018, according to analysts. China’s swift retaliation, rather than de-escalation, pointed to both Beijing’s preparedness and the likelihood that it does not intend to be rushed into negotiations with Washington. The country is now focused on expanding domestic demand to offset the trade war’s influence on external demand.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry amid trade tariffs imposed by the US. While the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales remains in effect for 2030, manufacturers will have greater flexibility in meeting annual targets and face reduced fines. The government has sped up the process of introducing these changes in response to the tariffs. The US is a major export market for the UK motor industry, and these measures aim to mitigate the negative impact of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts are anticipating that airlines will cut their 2025 outlooks due to faltering travel demand, with several firms slashing price targets and downgrading ratings on U.S. carriers.

Bookings between the U.S. and Europe for June through August are down about 13% compared to last year.

          <p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman urged Donald Trump to call a temporary time out on his reciprocal tariffs, while also acknowledging that he may have misjudged the president as he “assumed economic rationality would be paramount.” Ackman warned of a possible “economic nuclear winter” and stated that the tariffs are destroying confidence in the country as a trading partner. He suggested that Trump should call a 90-day timeout to negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that tariffs announced by President Donald Trump last week will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing. Dimon addressed the tariff policy in his annual shareholder letter, stating that the tariffs would likely lead to inflationary outcomes and slow down growth. He also highlighted the uncertainties created by the tariffs, including their effect on global capital flows and the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>
