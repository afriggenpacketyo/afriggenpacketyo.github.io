          <p>David Coote, a former Premier League referee, has pleaded guilty to a charge of making an indecent image of a child. The 43-year-old faced these grave charges following a thorough investigation by Nottinghamshire Police, which brought the case to light. This admission highlights the severe legal consequences for individuals, even those in prominent public-facing roles, when involved in such offenses. The case underscores the persistent efforts by law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute child sexual assault crimes, aiming to ensure justice and accountability for victims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK wage growth experienced a slight moderation over the summer, registering 4.7% in the three months to August, a marginal decrease from July's 4.8%. Concurrently, the national unemployment rate saw a slight uptick from 4.7% to 4.8%, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics. Analysts interpret these figures as indicators of a stabilizing UK jobs market after a period of volatility, though younger workers are reportedly facing the most significant challenges. This trend suggests that broader cost pressures in the labor market may gradually ease, potentially influencing future economic policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

This triumph positions India favorably, keeping them third in the early stages of the World Test Championship standings, behind Australia and Sri Lanka. The team's strong performance was significantly bolstered by first-innings centuries from both Yashasvi Jaiswal and captain Gill, setting a dominant tone for the series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is launching a comprehensive "Janus Project" to deploy next-generation commercial microreactors at military bases globally, particularly in remote or contested locations. This multi-million dollar initiative, led by Dr. Jeff Waksman, aims to provide 24/7 power, thereby reducing the military's dependence on fossil fuels and addressing critical logistical challenges. The Army plans to partner with private industry through a milestone-based contracting model, inspired by NASA's successful COTS program, to accelerate development and strengthen the industrial base for nuclear components. This strategic program seeks to deliver tangible, reliable energy capacity, with initial hardware construction anticipated by 2027, marking a significant step towards energy independence for military operations.</p>

          <p>U.S. rare earth miners' shares rallied significantly in premarket trading, extending previous gains amidst a renewed trade dispute with China. This surge followed President Donald Trump's threat of imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a direct response to Beijing's expanded export controls on critical minerals. Companies such as Critical Metals, USA Rare Earth, and MP Materials experienced substantial increases in their stock values, reflecting investor reactions to the escalating tensions. The situation underscores the global economic sensitivity to trade policies between the world's two largest economies, especially concerning critical resources where China holds dominant market control.

          <p>Western Alaska is experiencing "absolute devastation" after the remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds, ravaging storm surges, and floodwaters over the weekend. The disaster has left one person dead and two missing, with over 50 individuals rescued, some dramatically plucked from rooftops in hard-hit communities like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok. Officials are warning of a protracted and difficult recovery process, particularly with winter fast approaching, as many residents face extensive damage, power outages, and a lack of running water and essential heating. The incident tragically highlights the urgent need for enhanced climate resilience and robust infrastructure funding in vulnerable, low-lying regions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the Israel-Hamas war over, following a historic exchange of remaining Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, as part of his 20-point peace plan. Speaking to the Israeli parliament, Trump proclaimed a new era of peace and lasting harmony in the region. However, Middle East experts, including former U.S. Ambassador Michael Ratney, cautioned that the most difficult work is just beginning, with agreements still needed on critical issues like Israeli troop withdrawal and Hamas's demilitarization. The fragility of the ceasefire was immediately evident, as the Hostage Families Forum accused Hamas of violating the deal regarding the return of deceased hostages.</p>

These claims include unsubstantiated connections between acetaminophen and autism, the assertion that Amish communities have no autism due to avoiding medication, and advice against giving Tylenol to young children. Pediatricians and researchers emphasize that acetaminophen is widely considered safe for pain and fever during pregnancy and childhood when used correctly, citing a lack of scientific evidence for the White House's assertions.

          <p>A new book titled "Candid New York: The Pioneering Photography of George Bradford Brainerd" compiles the groundbreaking early work of a civil engineer who revolutionized photography in the 1870s. Brainerd developed early handheld cameras that could capture scenes with unprecedented detail, which he masterfully used to document the vibrant daily life on New York streets. His subjects ranged broadly, from street musicians and impoverished beggars to industrious paperboys, offering a rare and intimate glimpse into the era. Often referred to as the "father of instantaneous photography," his innovations were pivotal in shaping modern candid street photography and preserving historical moments.</p>

          <p>A special update to the DHL Global Connectedness Tracker, produced with NYU's Stern School of Business, forecasts that global trade growth will slow but not cease due to the Trump administration's tariffs. The report predicts an average annual growth rate of 2.5% between 2025 and 2029, a downward revision from an earlier 3.1% forecast. Although international trade surged in the first half of the year as companies rushed to front-load shipments before tariff increases, this momentum is expected to decelerate significantly. The comprehensive study, based on over 20 million data points, indicates that a complete reversal of globalization remains a risk rather than a current reality, highlighting trade's enduring strength.

Karyn Lewis, VP of research at NWEA, stressed that the chapter of educational recovery is far from over, noting that this stagnation is consistent across all demographic groups.

          <p>A spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), has revealed that two UK government schemes aimed at insulating homes were "botched on a vast scale," leaving tens of thousands of properties in need of urgent repairs. The report found that up to 98% of homes with external wall insulation and nearly a third with internal insulation, installed under the ECO4 and Great British Insulation Schemes, suffer from problems like damp and mold. The NAO attributed these failures to an "under-skilled workforce" and businesses cutting corners, with over a thousand homes posing "immediate health and safety risks." The government has pledged comprehensive reforms and promised to fix all affected homes at no cost to consumers.</p>

Canada, a primary lumber supplier to the U.S., will be particularly impacted, as combined duties on its products could reach 45%.

Its initial public offering, priced at the highest end of its range, was oversubscribed more than 54 times, attracting nearly $50 billion in bids—the strongest demand for an Indian IPO since 2008.
