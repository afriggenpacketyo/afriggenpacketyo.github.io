          <h2>Study Finds Foreign-Owned Firms Contributed to a Quarter of China's Corporate Emissions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 00:00:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that foreign-owned multinational enterprises were responsible for approximately 25% of all corporate carbon emissions in China over a 20-year period. The research, conducted by scientists from China and the UK, highlights a significant environmental and economic disparity. It found that while China's eastern coastal regions reaped more economic benefits from these firms, the central and western inland areas disproportionately bore the environmental burden. These findings raise new questions about assessing carbon responsibility for foreign companies operating within the country.</p>

          <p>A recent decision by the Trump administration to impose 39% tariffs on Swiss products has profoundly shocked Switzerland, a nation long defined by its economic stability and political neutrality. The move threatens to annihilate sales to the U.S., Switzerland's most important export market, prompting fears of mass layoffs and a major identity crisis. The article details how this action has shattered the country's sense of splendid isolation and exceptionalism, leaving its political establishment struggling to respond to a geopolitical reality it can no longer ignore. This economic confrontation has forced a national reckoning on its traditional foreign policy.</p>

          <p>China and Cambodia have launched a direct air corridor for fresh fruit, marked by the first two-tonne shipment of Cambodian durians arriving in China's Henan province. This development, part of China's 'durian diplomacy,' allows the fruit to reach Chinese consumers in just four hours via cold chain logistics, ensuring freshness. Durian is now the fifth Cambodian fruit approved for direct export to the vast Chinese market, following bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts. The move signifies strengthening agricultural trade ties and improved customs efficiency between the two nations, though some industry insiders remain cautious about the fruit's commercial competitiveness.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel members to face justice in the United States. The group includes prominent figures such as Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the 'Los Cuinis' organization allied with the powerful CJNG cartel. This action represents a milestone in the U.S. Justice Department's priority to dismantle dangerous drug networks operating across the border. The transfer occurred after the U.S. agreed not to seek the death penalty, reflecting ongoing diplomatic negotiations and pressure to curb the flow of illicit drugs.</p>

It chronicles the key events, including the initial investigation, Read's arrest, and the dramatic first trial that ended in a hung jury. The piece details the defense's argument that Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, contrasting with the prosecution's claim she struck O'Keefe with her vehicle. The timeline culminates with her acquittal on the most serious charges and conviction for driving under the influence.</p>

          <p>Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The location is historically resonant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The summit comes after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, and it is being framed by the White House as a 'listening exercise' rather than a negotiation for a definitive peace deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not expected to attend but will be briefed afterward, highlighting the high stakes and complex diplomacy involved.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has deployed 800 National Guard troops and 500 federal agents to Washington D.C., and taken temporary control of its police force, citing a need to combat what he calls out-of-control violent crime. The move has been met with sharp criticism from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who described it as an 'authoritarian push' and disputed the administration's claims about crime rates. According to city police data, violent offenses are at a three-decade low, creating a tense political standoff over public safety and federal authority in the nation's capital.</p>

Kim, the 52-year-old wife of impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has denied the allegations, which include accepting luxury items as bribes. Prosecutors sought her arrest over fears she would destroy evidence. This development adds to the country's political turmoil, as her husband also faces a trial for insurrection charges following his ouster from office, which could result in a life sentence.</p>

The National Science Foundation (NSF) had abruptly frozen over $584 million in funding, citing the university's alleged failure to prevent antisemitism. However, U.S. District Judge Rita F.

The artist was at a paintball tournament when police surrounded him with weapons drawn, based on a false report that he was armed and planning to harm people. After being held for 20 minutes, he was released, later stating on social media that he 'almost died today' during the traumatic encounter.</p>

Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to assume control of the local police during 'special conditions of an emergency nature.' Additionally, the president has direct command over the D.C.

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll reveals a significant shift in the New York City mayoral race, with Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani leading former Governor Andrew Cuomo by 19 percentage points. The poll shows incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, also running as an independent, with only 7% of the vote. In a hypothetical 2026 governor's race, Republican Elise Stefanik appears to be closing the gap on incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul. The results suggest a challenging political landscape for centrist Democrats in New York's upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive review of 19 Smithsonian museums to ensure their exhibits and materials are sufficiently 'patriotic' and align with 'American exceptionalism.' According to a White House letter, the initiative aims to remove 'divisive or partisan narratives' ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. This move follows an executive order to eliminate 'anti-American ideology' from the institution and has sparked significant concern among critics about political interference with historical and cultural curation at the world's largest museum complex.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding the use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology by providing ten new surveillance vans to seven police forces across England. The government claims the technology is a crucial tool for locating suspects in serious crimes like sexual offenses and homicides. However, civil liberties groups such as Big Brother Watch and Liberty have condemned the move as an 'alarming' expansion of the surveillance state. They argue that robust legal safeguards should be established before rolling out more of the intrusive and controversial technology.</p>

This admission follows the findings of a historical commission, which detailed how French colonial troops used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to suppress the independence movement, with the violence continuing even after independence was declared in 1960.</p>

This prospect of lower borrowing costs boosted market sentiment, increasing traders' bets on a rate cut to over 90%.

          <p>Peach harvests in California's Central Valley are down by as much as 30% this year due to the impacts of climate change. Warmer-than-usual winter weather disrupted the essential 'sleep' cycle for stone fruit trees, which require a certain number of hours below 45 degrees to regulate their growth and nutrient storage. This has led to a significantly smaller crop for farmers and higher prices for consumers across the country. The situation highlights the direct threat that a changing climate poses to agriculture and food supply chains.</p>
