          <p>President Trump's executive orders targeting major law firms have sparked alarm within the legal community.  These orders, while framed as addressing risks associated with 'Big Law,' are seen by legal scholars as a form of retribution against political opponents and a threat to the rule of law.  Several firms have filed lawsuits challenging the orders, and temporary injunctions have been issued while the cases proceed. The potential damage to the firms and the chilling effect on legal representation are significant concerns.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates, currently above 6%, are unlikely to return to the 3% levels seen in 2021 anytime soon.  The previous low rates were a response to the Federal Reserve's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Current higher rates reflect the Fed's efforts to combat inflation.  The article discusses factors influencing mortgage rates, including inflation, unemployment, and Treasury yields, suggesting that rates will likely remain elevated for the foreseeable future.  <i>(not investment advice)<br></i></p>
