          <p>Best Buy reported revenue and earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations for its latest quarter, driven by strong customer response to sales events and growth in computing and gaming categories. Despite this recovery, CEO Corie Barry maintained the full-year forecast due to uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts on consumers and the business. The retailer is focusing on innovation, expanding its third-party marketplace, and enhancing in-store experiences to stimulate growth. Shares of Best Buy experienced a slight decline in early trading following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock saw fluctuations following its latest earnings report, which highlighted robust demand for AI technologies but offered little clarity on its future in the Chinese market. The company reported a 56% surge in quarterly sales to $46.74 billion, slightly above analyst estimates, with adjusted earnings per share also topping expectations. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the early stages of AI infrastructure build-out, projecting trillions in spending by the end of the decade, despite ongoing concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China.</p>

          <p>Syria's interim government has postponed parliamentary elections in the Druze-majority province of Sweida and Kurdish-dominated regions of Hassakeh and Raqqa, citing security concerns and lack of central control. This exclusion affects over 5 million people, with their allocated seats remaining vacant. Both Kurdish and Druze leaders have condemned the decision as undemocratic, with some calling for separate governorates and uniting local armed factions. Critics argue the move further undermines the legitimacy of the indirect electoral process, which is already under scrutiny after 14 years of civil war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging his attempt to remove her from office, thereby initiating a legal dispute over the U.S. central bank's independence. Trump cited constitutional powers and allegations of false statements on her mortgage as reasons for removal, which Cook's attorney, Abbe Lowell, argues are unlawful and not valid 'cause' under the Federal Reserve Act. This case marks an unprecedented challenge to a president's authority to dismiss a Fed Governor, potentially escalating to the Supreme Court. The lawsuit highlights increasing political pressure on the Fed regarding interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>NBC plans to air special episodes of 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon' after 'Sunday Night Football' games this fall, aiming to attract new viewers from TV's top-rated program. This strategy follows a successful airing last season that garnered the show's best ratings of the year. The move comes as late-night television faces declining ratings and revenues in the streaming era, presenting an opportunity for 'Tonight' to capture audiences, especially with the departure of 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.' NBC remains committed to its late-night lineup, recognizing its value beyond ratings for promoting network properties.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster annual pace of 3.3% in the second quarter, an upward revision from the initial 3% estimate, following a contraction in the first three months of 2025. This growth was primarily driven by increased business investment and consumer spending, alongside a significant drop in imports after a first-quarter surge. While investment in AI is noted as a masking factor for underlying weaknesses, the overall economic picture for the first half of the year still shows a modest average growth rate.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit against President Trump, challenging her attempted dismissal, delves into the legal interpretation of 'for cause' removal for Fed board members. The suit argues that removal 'for cause' requires a connection to official conduct, not unsubstantiated allegations of private misconduct, referencing a 1935 Supreme Court case. White House officials maintain the president's authority to fire for cause, citing serious accusations regarding Cook's mortgage applications. This legal battle highlights the delicate balance of the Fed's independence against political influence, an issue previously raised by Trump's public statements about Chairman Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome has been airlifted to a hospital in southern France after sustaining multiple serious injuries in a training crash. The 40-year-old cyclist suffered five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a lumbar vertebrae fracture, though he is in stable condition and did not sustain head injuries. Froome is scheduled for back surgery and is expected to miss the remainder of the season, potentially impacting his competitive racing career.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering military force against drug cartels in Latin America, while also continuing diplomatic efforts and exploring demand-side solutions for the fentanyl crisis. Despite heated rhetoric, cooperation with Mexico's President Sheinbaum has resumed, including extraditions, border deployments, and joint surveillance. Experts caution against unilateral military action, emphasizing Mexico's sovereignty concerns and the historical ineffectiveness of supply-side strategies alone, particularly for synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The article suggests focusing on harm reduction and border interdiction, citing encouraging signs of declining overdose deaths, as a more prudent path forward.</p>

          <p>Australian police are conducting a manhunt for Dezi Freeman, a 56-year-old man suspected of killing two officers and wounding a third during a search warrant execution. Freeman, described by media as a radicalized conspiracy theorist and self-professed 'sovereign citizen,' is believed to be heavily armed and skilled in bush survival, familiar with the rugged terrain near Porepunkah, Victoria. Police are urging the public not to harbor him and have warned against traveling into the alpine area.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order aimed at cashless bail policies, asserting that government resources should not support jurisdictions that have eliminated cash bail for various crimes. Trump claims these policies endanger law-abiding citizens and encourage recidivism, though the U.S. Department of Justice data contradicts these assertions, showing high court appearance rates and low pre-trial rearrest rates. Critics argue that Trump is advancing myths about bail systems, which are often biased against racial minorities and the economically disadvantaged. The move is seen as benefiting the profitable bail bond industry rather than improving public safety.</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is experiencing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks nearly halved since 2005 due to large banks acquiring regional and community institutions. This trend raises concerns about reduced competition, innovation, and consumer choice. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system, with only 79 banks, was lauded as the soundest globally during the 2008 financial crisis. While Canada's system benefits from collective economic strength, some experts caution against market domination, especially as the Federal Reserve proposes lowering capital requirements for big U.S. banks.

Critics, including Welsh language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith and the Professional Association of Self-Caterers, argue these changes are insufficient and the 182-day threshold continues to harm the tourism industry.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, 'The Origin of Language' by Madeleine Beekman, proposes that the intense prehistoric need for assistance in child-rearing was a primary catalyst for the development of human language. This theory shifts focus from male-dominated evolutionary narratives to emphasize familial care, arguing that vulnerable early human offspring necessitated new modes of cooperation and communication. Beekman traces biological changes in vocal cords and brain growth that made language possible, suggesting that the drive to express needs and coordinate care for infants gradually led to the complex structures of words, syntax, and grammar. The article highlights how this perspective underscores the collective nature of raising children throughout human history.</p>
