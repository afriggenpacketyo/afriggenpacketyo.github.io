          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer after experiencing urinary symptoms. The cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 with metastasis to the bone, is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians. The diagnosis came after doctors found a small nodule that required further evaluation, and the former president's office indicated that the cancer can likely be managed.</p>

          <p>Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates discussed President Trump's foreign policy initiatives in the Middle East, including lifting sanctions on Syria and pursuing a diplomatic deal with Iran. Gates noted the strategic shift in the Middle East due to Israel's actions against Hamas and Hezbollah, and the weakening of Iran. He emphasized that any nuclear deal with Iran must include a complete halt to enrichment and the elimination of their ballistic missile programs. Gates also addressed the situation in Ukraine, stating that Putin's goals remain unchanged and that he seeks to recreate the Russian Empire. Gates ultimately advised that President Trump needs to figure out some leverage that he has going into a meeting with Putin to make him believe his interests are served by at least freezing things in place.</p>

          <p>Two crew members died and at least 22 were injured when a Mexican Navy sailing ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge. The ship, carrying 277 people, lost power and drifted into the bridge, causing its masts to smash. The vessel had been docked at Pier 17 in Manhattan and was en route to Iceland, but was apparently heading in the wrong direction when the accident occurred.

          <p>Israel has announced it will allow a "basic amount of food" into Gaza to prevent a potential famine after a 10-week blockade, citing the operational need to expand intense fighting against Hamas.

Gaza's health ministry reports that at least 67 people have been killed and 361 injured in the last 24 hours.

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, narrowly won the first round of Poland’s presidential election, according to exit polls. Trzaskowski, a member of Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Platform, secured 30.8 percent of the vote, slightly ahead of Karol Nowrocki, backed by the hard-right Law and Justice party, who received 29.1 percent. A runoff election is scheduled for June 1. The Polish presidency, while largely ceremonial, holds veto powers that can influence the government's agenda, making the election a crucial test for Tusk's efforts to reverse policies implemented by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration's policy of granting refugee status to White South Africans, stating that it aligns with the U.S.'s role as a beacon for the oppressed. This follows the arrival of the first group of Afrikaners in the U.S. after President Trump directed his government to allow their resettlement due to alleged oppression in South Africa. Rubio claims that White South Africans are facing property confiscations and threats to their lives due to their race, while the South African government denies these claims.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy condemned Donald Trump's acceptance of a $400 million Boeing jet from Qatar, labeling it as the "definition of corruption." He argued that Trump's recent trip to Gulf states was motivated by financial gains, with each country offering Trump money in exchange for national security concessions. Republican Senator Rand Paul expressed concerns about a potential conflict of interest, and former Vice President Mike Pence deemed the gift "inconsistent with our security," given Qatar's history of supporting terrorism. Trump has defended his decision, claiming the gift is for the U.S. and not for his personal use.</p>

          <p>Israel has retrieved thousands of items belonging to its most famous spy, Eli Cohen, after a covert operation in Syria, marking 60 years since his execution. The archive, held in Syrian intelligence safes for six decades, includes documents, recordings, photos, letters, and personal objects collected after Cohen's capture in 1965. Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian political echelon in the early 1960s, provided intelligence that significantly aided Israel's victory in the 1967 Middle East War.
