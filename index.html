          <p>Three more bullet trains in eastern Japan experienced malfunctions, specifically auxiliary power unit failures, after services were suspended for over five hours between Tokyo and northeastern Japan due to an initial train failure. The affected trains were a new type that debuted last year, and investigations are ongoing to determine if the failures are linked. JR East has decided to halt the operation of this train type outside of coupled services until the cause is clear, leading to the cancellation of over 20 trains between Tokyo and northeastern Japan. The initial incident involved a train halting in Tochigi Prefecture due to an auxiliary power unit failure and an overheated motor control device. </p>

          <p>North Korea is planning to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia's Kursk region to aid in reconstruction efforts, signaling deepening cooperation between the two nations. According to Russian officials, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has decided to deploy 1,000 sappers to clear mines and 5,000 military construction workers to restore infrastructure in the region. Kim has also expressed his unwavering support for Russia's efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, though details about the troop dispatch were not mentioned by North Korean state media. The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised concerns among the U.S., South Korea, and their allies, particularly regarding potential technology transfers that could advance North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.</p>

          <p>Investigators are working to determine the cause of the Air India Flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad, India, which occurred shortly after takeoff and resulted in a controlled flight into terrain. The focus is on analyzing the wreckage, cockpit voice recorder, and flight data recorder to understand what went wrong in the seconds after takeoff. Possible causes under investigation include engine failure due to bird strikes or fuel contamination, improperly extended flaps, maintenance errors, or inadvertent crew actions. The investigation will involve examining every component of the wreckage, maintenance logs, and signals from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders to build a comprehensive understanding of the events leading to the crash.</p>

Despite the efforts of immigrant rights activists, the undocumented community lives in fear and terror.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team recently told Judge Arun Subramanian it will need between two and five days to present its case, a stark contrast to its initial request of up to two weeks with witnesses on the stand. A change in timelines for the defense may signify Diddy's lawyers found "some weaknesses" in the government's case, according to New York-based attorney Nicole Brenecki. In a federal indictment unsealed Sept. 17, Combs was charged with racketeering conspiracy (RICO); sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. The "Last Night" rapper has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, in which witnesses have testified to alleged sexual assault, severe physical abuse, forced labor and drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a critical step toward its lunar ambitions in 2030. The test included a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where the spacecraft's escape engines ignited while grounded. The return capsule reached its designated altitude within 20 seconds, separated cleanly from the escape tower, and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag cushioning system. This safety test, the first of its kind since 1998, simulates emergency scenarios where astronauts must be rapidly extracted from danger during launch.</p>

          <p>Officials in Britain have issued a warning about unlicensed practitioners performing cosmetic procedures such as fillers and Botox in unsafe locations like public toilets and hotel rooms. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) says people's lives are at risk due to the lack of regulation in the industry and are calling for a licensing scheme. Concerns have also been raised about unsafe fillers and fat-dissolving injections being sold online, as well as counterfeit Botox causing adverse side effects. Trading standards officials are particularly worried about young people getting injections, as age verification is inconsistent, and advise checking qualifications and being wary of social media advertisements.</p>

          <p>Australia is set to become the first country globally to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. While most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality, those engaging in anal sex with new or multiple partners will need to wait three months to donate blood, though they are still eligible to donate plasma. The plasma donation rules will take effect on July 14, with updated blood donation approaches to be implemented in 2026.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly conducted strikes "in the area of Tehran" amid escalating hostilities with Iran. The first plane carrying Israelis stranded abroad due to flight cancellations has landed at Ben Gurion Airport as part of Operation Safe Return.

The Israeli Transportation Ministry estimates that around 150,000 citizens are abroad, with about one-third attempting to return home.</p>

          <p>Dozens of families are calling for an independent inquiry into maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust, citing concerns about inadequate care leading to deaths and injuries. These families have contacted the BBC with concerns about inadequate maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust between 2017 and 2024. The concerns include women feeling like they had not been listened to when they raised concerns, a lack of compassion, and families saying the trust made them feel like they were alone in their experience. The trust has expressed deep sorrow and acknowledged the need for improvements, but families are seeking a more comprehensive review of the maternity services.</p>

The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth was likely to moderate due to trade factors, which could lead to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The data comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S., with Japan prioritizing concessions for its key automobile sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Taylor suggests that European governments should maximize the use of NATO's command structure and experience in collective defense planning to prepare for a time when they may need to act without U.S. support. This involves building a strong European pillar within NATO, which could include leading a coalition to provide security guarantees for Ukraine. Until then, Taylor advocates for a strategy of "extend and pretend" to maintain transatlantic cooperation.</p>
