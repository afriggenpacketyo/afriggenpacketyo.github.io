          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after mistakenly arresting a 19-year-old undocumented college student, Ximena Arias Cristobal, during a traffic stop on May 5th. The officer, Leslie Allen O'Neal, cited Arias-Cristobal for an improper turn and driving without a license, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). After reviewing dashboard camera footage, officials dismissed the traffic charges on May 12th, and ICE released Arias Cristobal on May 22nd after an immigration judge granted her bond. Both Arias Cristobal and her father, who was also detained by ICE, face deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin stated that he believes there are enough Republican senators opposed to the House's budget bill to stall its progress and demand changes. The House narrowly passed the sweeping domestic policy package, but fiscal conservatives in the Senate are signaling their unwillingness to support it in its current form. Senator Johnson emphasized the need for the president to address spending reduction and deficit concerns before the bill can move forward. This resistance highlights the potential challenges the bill faces in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Germany's finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, has joined European politicians in urging talks with the U.S. after President Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe starting June 1st.

The EU's trade chief, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, has affirmed the bloc's commitment to securing a mutually beneficial deal, emphasizing that trade relations should be based on respect, not threats.

          <p>President Trump's recent warming towards the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. After Islamist rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad, Israel launched over 700 attacks on Syria, aiming to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands. However, following Trump's meeting with al-Shara and the announcement of lifting sanctions, Israeli strikes have significantly decreased. This shift in U.S. policy has raised concerns within the Israeli government, which views the new Syrian administration with skepticism, fearing it could become an anti-Israel government.</p>

          <p>In a Face the Nation interview, Representative Jim Himes criticized the House budget bill for cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance while preserving tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, adding $3 trillion to the deficit, and complicating the tax code. He urged President Trump to increase sanctions and pressure on Russia to achieve a fair resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war. Himes also cautioned against politicizing intelligence, citing the Iraq War as a cautionary tale, and condemned Joe Kent's alleged pressure to amend an assessment of links between the Venezuelan government and the Tren De Aragua gang.

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators to represent Essequibo, a territory internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana. President Nicol√°s Maduro's move is seen as an attempt to legitimize his rule amid domestic dissatisfaction and reported disloyalty within the military. Claims to the Essequibo region are deeply ingrained among many Venezuelans, who believe the land was historically theirs, but most residents of Essequibo identify as Guyanese and want to remain part of Guyana. The International Court of Justice has ordered Venezuela to refrain from electing officials to oversee the area, but Maduro has rejected the court's jurisdiction.</p>

Barkley defended the play, emphasizing that any team can utilize it, but the Eagles' success stems from their strong offensive line and Jalen Hurts' strength. He also dismissed safety concerns, arguing that the play's execution is not universally successful, citing examples of other teams struggling with it.

          <p>President Trump has again criticized Harvard University regarding its international students, asserting that their home countries are "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." This statement comes days after a federal judge blocked the administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Harvard argued that the revocation was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" and a punishment for rejecting the government's demands to control its governance and curriculum. International students comprise about 27% of Harvard's student body and are typically ineligible for federal financial aid.</p>

          <p>A longtime West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration's changes to the academy, specifically objecting to the president's use of a "Make America Great Again" hat during an address to graduating cadets. Parsons criticized the executive order ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the armed forces, stating that West Point began "eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments" to align with the administration's ideology. Parsons described the administration's actions as indoctrination rather than education, leading to a sense of professional betrayal.</p>
