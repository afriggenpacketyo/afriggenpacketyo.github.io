          <p>Comedian Cristela Alonzo reflects on her upbringing in a south Texas border town, where she lived in an abandoned diner with her undocumented mother and siblings. She details the constant fear of immigration enforcement and the financial hardships that defined her early life, shaping the personal and political themes in her comedy. Alonzo's experiences, including caring for her family and breaking into stand-up, are central to her Netflix specials, which explore class and the current political climate. The article highlights how recent ICE raids have resurfaced childhood anxieties about her mother's safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new fitness trend circulating on TikTok suggests that consuming a spoonful of honey and salt before exercising can provide a significant energy boost, similar to commercial pre-workout supplements. The combination of a rapidly digesting carbohydrate (honey) and sodium is believed to enhance physical performance. A certified holistic nutritionist interviewed for the article confirms the scientific basis for the trend but recommends pairing it with a more substantial snack for sustained energy. The article notes the hack's popularity is likely due to honey's quick absorption into the bloodstream.</p>

The article argues that the downgrade overlooks the bank's strategic shift towards diversifying its revenue streams beyond net interest income. Management is focusing on growing fee-based businesses like investment banking, capital markets, and credit cards to reduce dependency on Federal Reserve interest rate policies. The club views the stock as undervalued and believes CEO Charlie Scharf's long-term strategy will prove successful. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is sinking under more than $22.5 billion in debt, raising concerns about its long-term viability as climate change intensifies flooding across the country. The program, which provides essential coverage for millions of homeowners, is trapped between its mandates to keep insurance affordable and the rising costs of disaster recovery. The article argues that by subsidizing insurance in high-risk areas, the NFIP inadvertently encourages development in floodplains, creating a moral hazard. Experts warn that without significant reform, the system is unsustainable, posing a major threat to homeowners and taxpayers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has announced that it will halt the release of all economic data, including the crucial monthly jobs report and the consumer price index, if a government shutdown occurs. According to the department's contingency plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will suspend all operations, ceasing data collection and website updates. This data blackout would leave investors and Federal Reserve policymakers without key indicators of the economy's health ahead of important meetings. The suspension of these reports could create significant uncertainty in financial markets and for economic forecasting.</p>

          <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, with projections indicating a drop from 35 million to 34 million participants in 2026. Health insurers are scaling back on unprofitable plans and exiting some markets due to rising medical costs and new regulations affecting government reimbursement rates. As a result, seniors may face higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for their 2026 plans. The trend marks a significant shift for insurers, who are now focusing more on margin improvement rather than aggressive membership growth in the Medicare market.</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the U.S. government shuts down on October 1. Because the program is funded through mandatory spending, payments are not subject to the annual appropriations process that is currently stalled in Congress. However, a shutdown could disrupt other Social Security Administration (SSA) services, as its operating budget requires congressional approval. Services like benefit verifications, replacing Medicare cards, and processing earnings corrections could be temporarily halted, depending on how many SSA employees are furloughed.</p>

Ramsey emphasized that concentrating wealth in a small number of companies exposes an investor to catastrophic losses if those specific companies falter. He stressed that true long-term wealth building relies on spreading risk across many different investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To better achieve financial goals, behavioral economist Katy Milkman recommends a simple two-step process: set a specific goal and then create a reminder to take action. This approach helps bridge the gap between intention and execution, which is where many savings plans fail. For those who save manually, this could be a recurring calendar alert, while automating savings through direct deposit is an even more effective strategy. Milkman's research also shows that people are most motivated to start new habits during "fresh starts," such as the beginning of a new year or after a birthday.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has renewed his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies not made in the U.S., arguing that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries offering better financial incentives. He claimed the levy would protect national security and solve a long-standing problem of production moving overseas, particularly impacting California. The announcement created uncertainty about its implementation, including whether it would apply to streaming services and how an "American-made" movie would be defined. Industry analysts suggest such a tariff would significantly increase production costs, which would be passed on to consumers.</p>

Speaking at the Labour conference, Mahmood framed the policy as a way to ensure integration and counter the "false promises" of right-wing parties like Reform UK.

          <p>The Texas Department of Agriculture is implementing a new strategy to prevent the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, from entering the state from Mexico. The plan involves placing tape traps in high-risk areas along the border, near livestock pens, and at major ports to monitor for the flies that carry the parasite. The screwworm's larvae feed on the living tissue of warm-blooded animals and can be devastating to livestock, posing a significant threat to the U.S. agricultural industry. This proactive measure is part of a broader effort that includes investing in facilities to produce sterile flies.</p>

          <p>A potential $1.6 billion merger between Compass and Anywhere Real Estate would unite the two largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage companies, creating a dominant market player with a combined network of 340,000 agents. The deal would bring together Compass's regional strength with Anywhere's national brands like Century 21 and Coldwell Banker. While the companies tout the benefits of combined resources and scale, some industry experts worry the consolidation could further squeeze smaller, independent brokerages.

The frustration was highlighted in a text message from a U.S. grain trader, read by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, complaining that a U.S. bailout for Argentina inadvertently undercut American agricultural interests by allowing Argentina to reduce its grain prices for China.</p>
