          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's win in New York's mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats, business leaders, and billionaires are now strategizing to support an independent challenger, such as incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, to prevent a Mamdani victory in the general election. Conversely, progressive figures like former Mayor Bill de Blasio argue the win reflects the majority's will and that accusations of radicalism are unfounded. Mamdani is actively engaging with all factions, including the business community, aiming to build a broad coalition for his vision of an affordable and safe city for all residents.</p>

          <p>Four giant pandas on loan to the Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama, Japan, have been sent back to China, leaving only two of the iconic animals in the entire country. The departure of Rauhin and her three offspring marks the end of a successful joint breeding program that began in 1994 and produced 17 cubs, the most outside of China. A farewell ceremony was attended by thousands of visitors who expressed sadness but wished the pandas well. While this chapter of "panda diplomacy" closes, the zoo director expressed willingness to accept new pandas in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Florida suggests that body fat percentage is a much more accurate indicator of mortality risk than the commonly used Body Mass Index (BMI). Researchers found that over a 15-year period, individuals with high body fat were 78% more likely to die than those with healthy levels. The study criticizes BMI for its inability to distinguish between muscle and fat, rendering it an unreliable health metric for many individuals, such as bodybuilders. The findings suggest that more accessible methods for measuring body fat, like bioelectrical impedance analysis, should become a standard part of health screenings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's recent use of an expletive during a press conference about the Iran-Israel conflict, marking a rare instance of a U.S. president swearing deliberately on camera. The author suggests that while unconventional, the moment came across as authentic and effectively conveyed a frustration shared by many observers. The piece argues that in an era of polished and often distrusted political speech, occasional and judicious use of such language can make politicians appear more human and relatable. It contrasts this with the heavily scripted nature of most political communication, which can create a disconnect with the public.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has postponed a ruling on a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, creating uncertainty about the future of the Voting Rights Act. The case centers on whether a new map with two majority-Black districts, created to comply with the Act, constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court's decision to hold the case for re-argument is unusual and has voting rights advocates concerned it could lead to a weakening of protections against racial discrimination in elections. This case is one of several legal challenges that could limit the scope of the landmark 1965 law.</p>

          <p>Americans celebrating the Fourth of July may face higher prices and shortages of fireworks this year due to new tariffs on Chinese goods. The U.S. relies on China for nearly all of its consumer and professional fireworks, which are now subject to significant import taxes under the Trump administration's trade policy. Some importers have halted shipments to avoid the tariffs, likely leading to product shortages and prompting experts to advise early shopping. The industry is particularly concerned about 2026, the nation's 250th birthday, as continued high tariffs could drastically diminish the scale of planned celebrations across the country.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is ramping up the development and deployment of interceptor drones as an unconventional and cost-effective solution to counter intensified Russian airstrikes. Russia has significantly increased its use of Shahed drones, which now fly at higher altitudes, making them difficult for traditional mobile air defense units to shoot down. In response, Ukraine is mass-producing faster, specialized interceptor drones and training pilots for aerial combat to protect its cities and infrastructure. Experts believe this strategy is a more efficient alternative to expensive anti-aircraft missiles, with a single interceptor drone costing around $5,000 compared to up to $1 million for a missile.</p>

The move is part of Labour's new 10-year health strategy, which aims to simplify a system deemed overly complex and shift resources to frontline care. Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. While health leaders welcome reducing duplication, they caution that the vital functions of these bodies, such as patient feedback and staff safety, must be preserved within the new structure.</p>

          <p>Actor Damson Idris shared his experience preparing for his role in the new "F1: The Movie," where he stars alongside Brad Pitt. He described the intensity of learning to drive Formula 1 cars at speeds up to 180 mph on iconic tracks, a process supported by F1 champion Sir Lewis Hamilton, who is a producer on the film. Idris, known for his breakout role in "Snowfall," views this major Hollywood film as a new chapter in his career. He also lightheartedly recounted the challenge of trying to "look cute" while acting under the extreme physical forces of high-speed driving.</p>

The low-key comeback bout saw a more measured Wilder, who utilized his jab and set up his punches rather than relying solely on his famous right-hand power. While the win puts him back on a positive track, Wilder acknowledged he is on a new beginning and aims to become a more complete fighter before targeting the division's elite again.</p>

The dispute was highlighted when the Economy Minister, from the conservative CDU party, attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, angering her Social Democratic colleague, the Environment Minister. While Germany officially phased out its last nuclear plant in 2023, the CDU appears open to all low-emission technologies, including nuclear, to ensure energy security. This clashes with the SPD's focus on renewables and raises concerns about meeting Germany's climate targets, especially with plans for new gas-fired power plants.</p>

          <p>A top economist at China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a significant advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins due to its existing digital payment infrastructure. The research note suggests that platforms like WeChat and Alipay already function much like stablecoins, offering digital money pegged 1:1 to the fiat currency. These systems are supported by a mature regulatory framework that requires customer funds to be fully backed by central bank money. This existing ecosystem could provide a strong foundation for China to lead in the broader field of platform-based digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>
