          <p>The UK government is exploring financial support options for Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain companies, which are facing collapse after a cyber attack halted JLR's car production in late August. Factories remain suspended until next month, costing JLR an estimated £50 million weekly and jeopardizing smaller suppliers. Ideas include government purchasing components or providing loans, as a Covid-style furlough scheme has been ruled out due to cost. The Business and Trade Select Committee is investigating the impact, highlighting broader concerns over cyber attacks on UK institutions.</p>

          <p>New York sports radio hosts Gregg Giannotti and Boomer Esiason publicly criticized Mets announcer Gary Cohen for his remarks about Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw. Shaw missed a game to attend Charlie Kirk's memorial service in Arizona, a decision Cohen questioned due to the Cubs' pennant race. The radio hosts argued Cohen's commentary was unnecessary and potentially politically motivated, given Shaw's personal friendship with Kirk and the circumstances of Kirk's death. They emphasized the importance of personal decisions over team obligations in such a situation.</p>

          <p>More than a thousand disabled children in the UK are on hold for essential wheelchairs and mobility equipment, as the charity Whizz Kidz has closed its waitlist for the first time in 35 years. Escalating costs and strained NHS budgets are cited as reasons for the "national crisis," with many more children missing out on crucial independence. Families describe the profound impact of these delays, as children like 11-year-old Wren and teenager Ivy face limitations in school and daily life. Whizz Kidz has launched an appeal to raise £750,000 to reopen its services.</p>

          <p>Actress Jessica Chastain stated she is "not aligned" with AppleTV+'s decision to pause the release of her series, "The Savant," which focuses on an investigator tracking online hate groups. The postponement followed the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with the show's content featuring extremist attacks. Chastain argued on Instagram that the article is highly relevant to current events, including numerous violent incidents in the US, and aims to honor those who prevent violence. She expressed hope for the show's eventual release, despite respecting Apple's current stance.</p>

This downturn is attributed to rising costs from US tariffs, persistent inflation, and increasing reliance on technology for efficiency. The article notes a faltering US job market, with only 22,000 jobs added in August, and consumer spending pulling back due to tariff-driven price hikes.

          <p>A preliminary trial of the gene therapy AMT-130 has shown remarkable success, reducing Huntington's disease progression by 75% over three years in high-dose patients. This experimental one-time treatment, delivered via brain surgery, uses a harmless virus to turn off the harmful protein causing brain cell damage. While still years from FDA approval, researchers are thrilled by the statistically significant effects on disease progression, allowing some patients to return to work. This article highlights a major potential breakthrough for Huntington's, which affects about 100,000 Americans, offering significant hope.</p>

          <p>Over 100 former ABC News employees, including prominent figures, have sent a letter to Disney CEO Bob Iger. While commending Kimmel's reinstatement, they urge stronger action to publicly defend journalists and the network against political intimidation.

          <p>Medical professionals strongly advise pregnant women to continue using acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain and fever, directly countering President Trump's suggestion to "tough it out." Doctors warn that untreated fevers can harm both mother and baby, potentially causing cardiac or central nervous system abnormalities. They emphasize acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter option, with no scientific evidence linking it to autism. This article highlights concerns that Trump's comments, despite a cautious FDA statement, could lead women to avoid necessary medication or use riskier alternatives, posing significant public health risks.</p>

Democrats, however, focused on the victims being detainees, called for gun control, and urged a rejection of anti-immigrant sentiment.
