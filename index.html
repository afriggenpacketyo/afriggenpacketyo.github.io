          <p>Russian forces launched a significant drone and missile attack on Kyiv, injuring at least 14 people and striking residential areas. The assault occurred shortly after the U.S. announced a pause on some arms shipments to Ukraine, a decision President Trump defended by stating the need to preserve domestic supplies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his intention to discuss the weapons delay with President Trump, highlighting the potential impact on Ukraine's defensive capabilities during Russia's intensified offensive.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its markets, accusing it of widespread manipulation of the Nifty 50 index. The regulator also froze over $566 million in alleged illegal gains, stating the firm used a deliberate strategy of buying stocks to inflate an index, betting on its decline, and then selling off to profit from options trades. Jane Street has disputed the findings and affirmed its commitment to regulatory compliance, but SEBI described the firm's behavior as untrustworthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A family vacation in the Bahamas turned tragic when a 42-year-old Texas man was struck by a speeding boat's propeller while snorkeling near the shore. The former Army Ranger sustained severe, nearly fatal injuries to his lower body, and the two individuals in the boat fled the scene. The victim was airlifted to a hospital in Miami for intensive care, and his family is now seeking to identify the boat operators responsible for the hit-and-run. The incident has also highlighted the importance of having travel medical insurance for international trips.</p>

          <p>A drive-by shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. The attack occurred as a crowd was leaving an album release party for rapper Mello Buckzz, and police believe it was a targeted incident. Authorities are concerned about potential retaliation and have increased their presence, while the venue has been temporarily shut down. This location was also the site of a previous mass shooting in 2022 when it operated under a different name.</p>

While a political advisor insists the trip is focused on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting rural issues, the visit is widely seen as an effort to build a national profile.

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two others injured. The blasts at Devastating Pyrotechnics in the community of Esparto triggered a large fire that spread to surrounding grasslands, burning approximately 80 acres. Family members have identified some of the missing as workers who were on their first day at the facility. Local officials confirmed the business lacked the proper county licenses to store fireworks on the agricultural property, and federal authorities have been called to assist in the investigation.</p>

          <p>Advocates and local officials are raising alarms about public safety at national parks due to significant staffing shortages. At Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland, for example, shuttered lifeguard towers are a visible sign of the issue, which stems from a Trump administration hiring freeze and budget cuts that have reduced the National Park Service's permanent staff by 24%. The National Parks Conservation Association reports that thousands of seasonal positions remain unfilled nationwide, leading to fears of increased risk for visitors as the busy summer season continues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a massive legislative package, a signature goal of President Trump's second term, by a narrow 218-214 vote. The bill includes trillions in tax and spending cuts, boosts defense funding, and dramatically increases resources for immigration enforcement. Despite initial opposition from some Republicans over changes made in the Senate, party leadership, with direct engagement from the president, secured the votes for passage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has placed 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's policy direction under the Trump administration. The employees' letter argued the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment, a rare public rebuke from within the agency. In response, the EPA accused the signatories of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and placed them on paid leave pending an investigation. This action follows a series of moves by the EPA to roll back environmental regulations.</p>

While acquitted of the most serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges, he was convicted on two lesser counts and still faces significant jail time and numerous civil lawsuits. The trial revealed sordid details of his private life, which have permanently tarnished his image as a hip-hop mogul. Despite the damage and a diminished musical influence in recent years, some observers believe his dedicated fanbase may still allow for a potential comeback.</p>
