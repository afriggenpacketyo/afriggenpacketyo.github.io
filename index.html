          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Boeing as his "new favorite stock," viewing its recent price decline as a significant buying opportunity. Despite the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching new highs, Boeing shares have struggled, dropping about 10% in September. Cramer also warned about the risk posed by the rising 10-year Treasury yield, noting its potential to negatively impact various stocks, similar to headwinds seen last fall. He also commented on Nvidia's collaboration with Intel, framing it as a strategic win for Nvidia's expansion into enterprise data centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who negotiated Jeffrey Epstein's controversial 2008 plea deal, testified in a closed-door deposition before the House Oversight Committee. Acosta, who later served as Labor Secretary under President Trump, resigned from that post amid public outcry over his role in the lenient agreement. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that the deposition would be "hard-hitting," aiming to uncover why Epstein received what many consider a "sweetheart plea deal" despite numerous warnings about his crimes. Comer emphasized that the investigation is moving quickly with cooperation from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he was not pressured by President Trump on how to vote regarding interest rates ahead of this week's decision. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the one approved, confirmed he only had a brief congratulatory call with the president and did not discuss his policy position. His stance places him significantly apart from most other Federal Open Market Committee members. Miran also addressed concerns about his independence, dismissing them as "silly" and affirming his intent to serve only until his term expires in January 2026.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a Republican-led short-term funding bill with a 217-212 vote, aiming to keep the government open until November 21. The measure now faces significant opposition in the Senate, where it requires at least seven Democratic votes to pass, a prospect that seems unlikely. The bill includes additional security funding for lawmakers but lacks Democratic priorities related to healthcare, which Democrats have called "poison pills." With the September 30 deadline approaching, both parties remain far apart, increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown as neither side appears willing to compromise.</p>

          <p>Mark A. Welsh III has resigned as president of Texas A&M University less than two weeks after a student's complaint about "gender ideology" in a classroom went viral. The controversy led to the firing of an instructor and the dismissal of a dean and department chair. Welsh, a retired four-star Air Force general, had been leading the university since 2022.

          <p>The fate of TikTok in the United States may depend on a licensing deal for its powerful and closely guarded algorithm, a major point of contention in negotiations. The Chinese government had previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, but recent statements suggest a potential softening of this stance. A possible framework could involve a U.S. entity licensing the technology from parent company ByteDance, allowing engineers to recreate the content-recommendation system for a new U.S. app. This arrangement aims to address national security concerns while allowing ByteDance to retain some ownership and revenue from its core technology.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made significant progress toward a deal for TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call, but did not finalize an agreement.

The ongoing negotiations aim to resolve national security concerns raised by lawmakers while allowing the popular social media app to continue operating in the U.S. President Trump has expressed a desire to keep TikTok active, citing its value and its role in his 2024 election campaign.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw's start on Friday, which may be his last at Dodger Stadium, will be broadcast exclusively on Apple TV+. The game is part of a package of Friday night games that Major League Baseball sold to the streaming service, limiting access for fans who typically watch on the regional sports network, SportsNet LA. Kershaw, a three-time Cy Young award winner, announced on Thursday that he plans to retire at the end of the season. This situation is reminiscent of 2022, when Albert Pujols' historic 700th home run was also aired exclusively on the Apple platform.</p>

          <p>Wiltshire Police have arrested two South Western Ambulance Service workers in connection with the deaths of six adults. The investigation, which began in 2023, led to the arrest of a man in his 30s on suspicion of six counts of gross negligence manslaughter and a 59-year-old woman on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. The ambulance service stated it launched an internal investigation upon becoming aware of concerns and has been cooperating with the police. The two workers were immediately relieved of their duties, and one is no longer employed by the trust.</p>

          <p>Mixed martial arts fighter Raja Jackson has been arrested on felony charges after a livestreamed, unscripted assault on professional wrestler Stuart Smith during an event in Sun Valley. Jackson was seen running into the ring and brutally punching Smith, who appeared to be unconscious, more than 20 times before other wrestlers intervened. The incident reportedly stemmed from an earlier confrontation where Smith smashed a beer can on Jackson's head, which Smith believed was part of the scripted performance. Jackson was booked on $50,000 bail following a police investigation into the August 23rd attack.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually. The guidance clarifies that workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare, legal, and financial services, will not qualify for the tax break. Additionally, automatic gratuities, such as fixed service charges for large parties, are not considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary. The deduction, part of a bill passed in July, is set to be in effect from 2025 through 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal includes the elimination of all funding for the Migrant Education Program (MEP), a nearly 60-year-old federal initiative supporting over 250,000 children of seasonal agricultural workers. The program provides crucial services like tutoring, summer enrichment, and college readiness workshops to help students overcome educational disruptions caused by frequent moves. Advocates argue that cutting the program would remove a vital lifeline for a vulnerable population whose parents are essential to the nation's food system. The proposal follows a recent, temporary freeze on nearly $7 billion in education funds that was reversed after legal and political pressure.</p>

If successful, the acquisition would create a media behemoth with an extensive portfolio of content, sports rights, and major film studios.

This move came after medical experts warned that altering the three-decade-old practice of administering the shot at birth would leave infants vulnerable. The committee also reversed a previous day's vote concerning insurance coverage for a combined measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox vaccine for young children.</p>

The resolution frames his killing as a reminder of the threat of political extremism.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that Russia's oil revenues in Europe have decreased by 90% since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The new measures, which require approval from all 27 EU member states, aim to further curtail Russia's energy profits by expanding sanctions on its oil sector and banning EU purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas.

This counterintuitive movement reflects investor focus on broader economic factors beyond short-term rates, including economic growth projections, inflation, and government debt issuance. The Fed reduced its benchmark rate by a quarter point, with policymakers indicating two more cuts are likely this year. Recent data showing fewer jobless claims has eased some concerns about a potential slowdown in the U.S. labor market. (not investment advice)</p>
