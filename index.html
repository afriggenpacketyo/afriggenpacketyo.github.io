          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and multiple injuries. Authorities have detained a person of interest, confirming through surveillance footage that there was only one shooter, alleviating initial reports of two suspects. The incident occurred at the club's restaurant, with a witness stating the suspect was subdued after being hit with a chair before being taken into custody. Police have assured the public there is no ongoing threat while the investigation continues into the circumstances of the attack.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is intensifying over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters, passing east of Bermuda without any current watches or warnings in effect. While no direct landfall in the U.S. is anticipated, distant swells from the storm are projected to reach the East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada early next week. The season has so far been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has found evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. Researchers from several universities analyzed high-resolution images taken since 2009, identifying 41 new landslides that appear to have been triggered by moonquakes. This discovery has significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases, as it highlights previously unexplored geological hazards that must be considered. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal National Science Review, which is supervised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed five new bills aimed at protecting residents from federal immigration enforcement operations. The most prominent new law, the "No Secret Police Act," prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks and requires them to be identifiable by name and badge. Other laws restrict immigration agents' access to schools and hospitals without judicial warrants and require schools to notify families of federal agent presence. These measures are a direct response to the Trump administration's immigration policies and have been criticized by federal officials as dangerous to their agents.</p>

          <p>The remaining dates of singer d4vd's world tour have been canceled as police investigate the death of a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in a car registered to him. The body of Celeste Rivas, who was reported missing last year, was discovered in the trunk of a Tesla that had been towed from a Hollywood Hills street. While the 20-year-old artist, whose real name is David Anthony Burke, is cooperating with the investigation, no suspects have been named and no arrests have been made. The tour cancellations were announced shortly after the teenager's identity was released.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide and one of his former attorneys, to be the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The appointment follows the contentious departure of Erik Siebert, who resigned amid pressure from the administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Halligan, who represented Trump during the Mar-a-Lago documents probe, would take over an office in turmoil over the politically charged investigation. The move has been criticized by Virginia's Democratic senators as an attempt to weaponize the Justice Department against political adversaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate has paradoxically led to an increase in long-term rates, including those for mortgages. While the stock market rallied on the news, bond traders sold off long-term bonds, driving their yields higher. Analysts suggest this reaction indicates the bond market's concern that the Fed may be easing its focus on inflation at a time when it remains above the 2% target. This market movement signals skepticism about aggressive rate cuts while the economy appears steady, creating potential headwinds for homebuyers and others reliant on long-term loans.

A 2019 inquest concluded she was killed by one or two British soldiers, but progress on the case has been slow.

          <p>Despite general consumer caution and economic headwinds, sales of used electric vehicles in the U.S. have surged, with a 40% spike recorded in July. This trend is driven by the discovery that pre-owned EVs are often priced lower than comparable gasoline-powered cars, a perception that counters the common belief about high EV costs. New owners express high satisfaction, citing the elimination of fuel expenses and the overall driving experience as major benefits. This boom in the used market, along with aggressive lease deals on new models, is making electric vehicles more accessible to a wider range of consumers.</p>

The suspect, Anibal Hernandezsantana, was charged with multiple felonies after at least three bullets were fired into the station's lobby while the building was occupied; no injuries were reported. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, and it is unclear if it is connected to a protest held the previous day regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. The station's parent company, TEGNA, has increased security and is cooperating with the ongoing police investigation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that the proliferation of AI and humanoid robots by 2030 will lead to an era of "sustainable abundance" and a "universal high income." Responding to a claim that automation will replace all jobs, Musk stated that intelligent robots will far outnumber humans, providing for everyone's needs. He envisions a future where society moves beyond a basic income safety net to one where everyone has access to the best healthcare, housing, and services. Critics question the economic and political feasibility of such a system, citing current national debt and resistance to universal welfare programs.</p>

          <p>Jane Austen's classic 1815 novel "Emma" is being reimagined for the 21st century in a new stage adaptation at London's Rose Theatre. Written by Ava Pickett, this modern version places the meddling protagonist Emma Woodhouse in contemporary Essex, where she interferes with her friends' dating app profiles instead of arranging society matches. The play explores themes of social class, friendship, and love through a modern lens, reflecting on the pressures of online dating and returning home after university. The adaptation aims to capture the timeless human elements of Austen's story while grounding them in a relatable, present-day context.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of university students in the UK are taking on part-time jobs and long commutes because their government maintenance loans fail to cover basic living costs. Recent studies indicate that the maximum loan covers only about half of what is needed for a minimum standard of living, leaving a significant financial gap. Students report working up to 30 hours a week or commuting for hours from their family homes to afford their education, often at the expense of their studies and social lives. This financial pressure highlights the increasing unaffordability of higher education for many young people.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a supplement widely known for enhancing muscle mass and athletic performance, is now being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating "brain fog." As a naturally occurring compound that helps cells produce energy, creatine is vital for high-intensity physical activity. A growing body of research suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus, particularly in individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies. While many users, including perimenopausal women, report positive effects on mental clarity, experts caution that research is still developing and results are not guaranteed for everyone.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced its decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September. This marks a significant shift in British foreign policy, which previously held that recognition should come as part of a negotiated peace process. The move follows growing pressure from within the Labour Party and from international allies like France, amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. While the government has framed it as a step toward a two-state solution, critics have labeled it a symbolic gesture that rewards terrorism, putting the UK at odds with the United States.</p>

          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed two weeks ago, is set to draw major political figures, including President Trump, to a stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The event, organized by Turning Point USA, will feature heightened security measures, including TSA-level screening, amid concerns about political violence. Kirk's death has intensified deep political divisions in the U.S., with the Trump administration blaming the "radical left" for the attack. The high-profile nature of the service, expected to be attended by tens of thousands, has prompted a significant security response to ensure the safety of attendees.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals last month without first informing the White House, according to sources familiar with the matter. The list included career CIA officials and two Democratic congressional staffers, causing internal frustration as the White House had no opportunity to vet the names beforehand. Gabbard claimed her actions were at President Trump's direction to punish those involved in the "politicization of intelligence," particularly regarding assessments of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The episode has reportedly deepened existing tensions between Gabbard's office and the CIA.</p>

The arrangement aims to resolve national security concerns that the Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could access the data of American users.
