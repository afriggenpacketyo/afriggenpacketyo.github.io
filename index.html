          <p>Chinese scientists have tested key components for a quantum-based network during a rocket flight to assess their resilience to space travel conditions. The experiment involved a laser module and a phase encoding device aboard a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket, which reached an altitude of 2.5km. This test is a crucial step toward building an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications that do not require encryption keys. The successful completion of this test signifies China's progress in establishing a quantum secure direct communication network, which is considered a highly efficient and secure form of communication.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is implementing more aggressive tactics to address its ongoing homelessness crisis, including targeted sweeps of homeless encampments. Between June 2024 and June 2025, nearly 1,000 people have been arrested or cited for illegal camping, though few are ever charged. Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city leads with services and aims to get people off the streets and into shelters, mental health care, and drug treatment programs. Despite criticisms regarding the suitability of available shelters, the city reports that nearly half of its 8,000 homeless individuals are now sheltered, a 35% increase since 2019, and business leaders are showing renewed engagement and optimism.</p>

          <h2>Young Offenders Often Denied Credit for Time Served in Juvenile Detention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 20:54:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that in many states, young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served while awaiting trial. This practice adds months to the duration that young people are confined, incurring significant costs and negatively impacting their well-being. Experts argue that this disparity stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to unequal application of fundamental rights. While some states offer time credit, it rarely makes a meaningful difference, as detention centers often lack the rehabilitative programs needed for release, ultimately harming young people and increasing recidivism.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is challenging President Trump's proclamation barring international students from enrolling, arguing that it is illegal and violates the rights of thousands of students. The university amended an earlier lawsuit, asserting that the ban denies students the right to pursue education and Harvard the right to teach them. The White House claims Harvard is a "hotbed of anti-American, antisemitic, pro-terrorist agitators," allegations the school denies. Harvard contends that Trump's actions are retaliatory, stemming from the university's refusal to cede control of its governance, curriculum, and ideology, and that the proclamation is an attempt to circumvent a prior court order protecting international students' enrollment.</p>

          <p>A preliminary NTSB report indicates that an American Airlines flight that caught fire after takeoff from Denver International Airport in March had engine parts installed incorrectly. The report revealed a loose part inside the right engine, installed in the wrong direction, and fuel leaking from an incorrectly fastened fitting. Passengers and crew members noticed fire and smoke filling the cabin shortly after landing, leading to an evacuation on the plane's wings. The aircraft sustained substantial damage, and twelve passengers along with six crew members sustained minor injuries.</p>

The attorney emphasized that the system failed Decker, suggesting that if he had received the necessary help, the tragedy could have been avoided.

          <p>The Labour government in England plans to mandate that most new build homes must be fitted with solar panels under upcoming regulations. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that this move is "just common sense" and could save households Â£500 annually on energy bills. Developers will be required to add panels unless the buildings meet specific exemptions, such as being shaded. The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes.</p>
