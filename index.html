          <p>Tens of thousands gathered at a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an event that combined elements of a spiritual revival and a political rally. The service featured prominent speakers, including Donald Trump, and was marked by an emotional address from Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, who announced she forgave the man charged with her husband's murder. Many attendees and speakers framed Kirk as a martyr for his cause, vowing to continue his work and spreading a message that mixed personal remembrance with sharp political rhetoric against ideological opponents. The atmosphere underscored the deep emotions and political resolve following his recent assassination.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child psychology expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in everyday interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than lecturing, these parents validate their child's feelings and treat mistakes as learning opportunities. The article suggests that creating an environment of emotional safety and connection is the true foundation for developing strong social skills.</p>

          <p>UK Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has stated that reforming the welfare system is a necessity that must proceed. He vowed to press forward with changes aimed at providing better support for individuals to return to work and addressing the escalating costs of benefits. This commitment comes after the government recently abandoned a major policy intended to cut disability benefits. McFadden emphasized that the current system is unhealthy for recipients and fiscally unsustainable, suggesting that specially trained job centre staff will offer voluntary support to those on long-term sickness benefits.

          <p>A team of scientists is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease on the island of Nantucket by genetically engineering the local mouse population. The project, led by an MIT associate professor, aims to make the native white-footed mice—the primary carriers of Lyme bacteria—heritably immune to the disease. By introducing an antibody gene into the mice, they hope to break the infection cycle where ticks feed on infected mice and then transmit the illness to humans. The project is proceeding with a strong emphasis on community consultation to ensure public buy-in before any potential release.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has officially launched with an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing the "fearless pursuit of truth." Founded by figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat what they see as a culture of self-censorship and ideological conformity on other campuses. For now, the institution offers free tuition, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations.

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies, which can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, has completed its mysterious and epic 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. This annual journey is a natural wonder, guided by the butterflies' internal clocks and compasses. However, the monarch population has declined significantly over the past 30 years due to threats like habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants essential for their caterpillars. Conservation efforts, including planting milkweed waystations and tagging butterflies, are underway to protect this iconic species.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their regular-season home finale to the San Francisco Giants 3-1, despite a strong seven-inning, one-hit performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan.

The game marked a milestone for the franchise, as attendance surpassed four million for the first time, reflecting strong fan support throughout the season. With their magic number to clinch the division title at three, the team is now focused on its final road trip before an expected return to Dodger Stadium for the playoffs.</p>

          <p>Sir Nick Clegg, the former UK Deputy Prime Minister, has described the relationship between Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump as "getting a bit embarrassing." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg labeled the government's "endless knee-bending" as "slightly cringey" and urged the prime minister to more forcefully advocate for British values. He argued that the UK's current approach is based on a miscalculation that it does not have to choose between the US and the EU.

          <p>The southern right whale population in South Australia is showing a remarkable recovery, thirty years after the establishment of the Great Australian Bight Marine Park. Researchers from Flinders University report that the repopulation rate is among the fastest in the world for this species, which was once hunted to near extinction. These whales were considered the "right whales" to hunt due to their slow speed. The success story highlights the critical importance of marine protected areas in allowing threatened species to rebound and underscores how targeted conservation efforts can yield significant positive results for ecosystems.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has warned that his country's economy could face a crisis comparable to the 1997 meltdown if it accepts current U.S. demands in trade negotiations. The dispute centers on a proposed $350 billion investment from South Korea into the U.S. President Lee stated that making such a large cash investment without safeguards, such as a currency swap agreement with the U.S., would create significant financial instability for South Korea. These remarks highlight a major obstacle in the stalled trade talks between the two allied nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated that he would support a deal between the U.S. and North Korea that involves freezing Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program rather than its complete dismantlement. In an interview, he described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" and an "interim emergency measure," given that North Korea continues to produce new weapons. President Lee believes that as long as the long-term goal of denuclearization is not abandoned, there are clear benefits to halting North Korea's current nuclear and missile development. This position signals a pragmatic shift in Seoul's approach to negotiations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. The government and airport officials champion the expansion as a vital opportunity for economic growth and job creation. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners who are concerned about the increased noise, traffic, and climate impact the expansion will cause.</p>

When a 68-year-old man collapsed in his seat shortly after kickoff, fellow fans immediately called for help, and a nurse in the section rushed over to perform life-saving CPR. The man's daughter, who witnessed the event, said she watched life fade from her father's face before the quick actions of the fans revived him.

          <p>In a significant shift in foreign policy, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that the United Kingdom now formally recognizes a Palestinian state. The move, coordinated with other nations including Australia and Canada, is intended to "keep alive the possibility of peace and a two-state solution" amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The decision was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority but drew fierce criticism from the Israeli government, which described it as a "huge reward to terrorism." The recognition is largely symbolic but aims to build new momentum for a long-term peace process.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mountain lion, known to researchers as F390 and the mother of two 14-month-old cubs, was killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in San Juan Capistrano. Her death leaves her adolescent cubs to survive on their own during a critical period when they would still be learning essential hunting and navigation skills from her. Conservationists from the UC Davis California Carnivores Program have since managed to place a GPS tracking collar on the female cub to monitor her progress.

In response, a chief Taliban spokesman urged the U.S. to adopt a policy of "realism" and cited the Doha Agreement, in which the U.S. pledged to respect Afghanistan's territorial integrity. A defense official added that ceding any Afghan soil is "out of the question," firmly dismissing the possibility of a U.S. return to the sprawling military facility.</p>

For over 90 minutes, the strategy nearly worked, as City frustrated the home side. However, Arsenal finally broke through with a 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli, salvaging a 1-1 draw and leaving both title contenders to share the points.</p>
