          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California with illegally exporting millions of dollars worth of sensitive Nvidia AI chips to China. The individuals allegedly operated a company, ALX Solutions, to ship advanced semiconductors like the H100 GPU without the required export licenses. According to the criminal complaint, they concealed their activities by routing shipments through countries like Malaysia and Singapore. This case highlights the ongoing U.S. effort to restrict China's access to critical technology and the methods used to circumvent these controls.</p>

          <p>Japan marked the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima with a solemn ceremony attended by global officials. During the event, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the growing global military build-up and the idea that nuclear weapons are necessary for defense, stating such trends threaten global peace frameworks. Survivors shared harrowing memories of the 1945 attack, which killed over 200,000 people, connecting their past suffering to current global conflicts. The mayor also urged the Japanese government to ratify the international treaty banning nuclear weapons, a pact currently opposed by nuclear powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) reveals that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered the most significant annual decline in coral cover in nearly 40 years of records. The primary cause is identified as severe and widespread coral bleaching due to heat stress from climate change, compounded by cyclones and starfish outbreaks. This marks the first time Australia's two largest reefs, the Great Barrier and Ningaloo, have experienced bleaching simultaneously. Experts warn the reef is approaching a tipping point where it may not recover between catastrophic events.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony related to her case, arguing it would violate her due process rights while her conviction appeal is pending. The filing emphasizes that unlike the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell is alive and her legal options remain viable. Meanwhile, Epstein accuser Annie Farmer has requested the transcripts be released to provide accountability, albeit with redactions to protect victims. The DOJ has admitted the testimony in question is primarily from law enforcement officers, not from any alleged victims directly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists in China are currently debating the merits of establishing official, measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents, like Chang Xiuze from the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, argue for including metrics such as the household consumption rate as a key national indicator to boost domestic demand. They point to China's relatively low rate of 39.6% in 2023 as a cause for concern. However, other influential thinkers argue that such specific benchmarks are not operationally feasible to implement as concrete policy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire, now the largest in California this year, has burned nearly 84,000 acres across the Los Padres National Forest and is threatening over 800 structures. The blaze, which started as four smaller fires, remains only 9% contained and has forced evacuations in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. At least three people have been injured, including a motorist overrun by flames and two contract employees in an ATV accident. Officials expect a warming and drying trend to intensify fire behavior, with over 1,900 personnel currently battling the flames in difficult, steep terrain.</p>

          <p>After more than 50 years, police have identified a young boy found deceased in Virginia in 1972 as four-year-old Carl Matthew Bryant from Pennsylvania. The breakthrough came from advanced DNA testing on a hair sample, which led investigators to Bryant's relatives and his mother, who died in 1980. While the boy's identity is now known, the circumstances of his death from blunt force trauma, and the disappearance of his infant brother, James, remain unsolved. Detectives believe the boys' mother and her then-boyfriend, both now deceased, were involved in the murders.</p>

The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, just below the anticipated 49 cents, even as revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates. The company's AI business revenue declined, partly due to U.S. export restrictions to China, which cost an estimated $800 million in the quarter.

Abbott's lawsuit argues this constitutes abandonment of office and seeks Wu's ouster as a consequence.

          <p>Sources familiar with Ghislaine Maxwell's recent interview with the Department of Justice claim she told officials that Donald Trump never did anything that caused her concern. The nine-hour interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was reportedly requested by Maxwell herself. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is considering a public release of the interview transcripts and audio recordings. Maxwell is currently appealing her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, and President Trump has not ruled out the possibility of a pardon for her in the future.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is scheduled to start the team's first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. The decision comes as other quarterbacks on the roster, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, are dealing with hamstring injuries, and veteran Joe Flacco is not expected to play much. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick from Colorado, was surprisingly listed as QB4 on the initial depth chart. This start provides a significant opportunity for him to compete for a roster spot after a prolific college career playing for his father, Deion Sanders.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the fatal Titan submersible implosion concluded the tragedy was preventable and caused by OceanGate's negligence and flawed safety culture. The report states the company used "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory scrutiny and silenced employees who raised safety concerns, including firing a whistleblower. Investigators faulted CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, for ignoring warnings and creating an environment where safety was underemphasized. The report cites the submersible's inadequate design and continued use despite known damage as key factors in the catastrophic failure.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting a rise in flea-borne typhus infections, particularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The disease is spread by fleas that have bitten infected animals like rats, opossums, and stray cats, with cases peaking in late summer and fall. So far this year, Los Angeles County has reported 79 cases, while Long Beach has seen 20 cases, a significant jump from the previous year. Officials are advising residents to use flea control on pets, secure trash, and avoid contact with stray animals to prevent infection.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have announced they will not pursue the death penalty against three high-profile accused Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, while Zambada is charged with running a powerful Sinaloa cartel faction. The decision comes despite President Trump's calls for capital punishment for drug traffickers. Mexico, which has abolished the death penalty, typically requires assurances against its use when extraditing its citizens, a condition that may have influenced this decision.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France, injuring nine people, one critically, and forcing the closure of a major highway. The fire has burned over 11,000 hectares, leading to the partial evacuation of a village and several campgrounds. Unfavorable weather conditions, including strong winds and dry terrain, are accelerating the fire's spread. More than 1,200 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, have been mobilized to combat the blaze, which has prompted President Emmanuel Macron to state that all national resources are being deployed.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis has found that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since President Trump took office in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. While attacks were already rising in 2024, they escalated sharply after his inauguration, reaching the highest levels of the war. This increase coincided with two temporary pauses in U.S. military aid to Ukraine and a significant ramp-up in Russian munitions production. Critics suggest the administration's approach may have emboldened Moscow, while the White House maintains it is working to stop the killing.</p>

          <p>New research from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park indicates that social relationships between female mountain gorillas are more crucial than previously thought. A 20-year study of their behavior found that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she actively seeks out and joins other females she already knows, even if they have been separated for years. This behavior highlights the importance of these same-sex bonds, as having an ally helps a new arrival navigate the social hierarchy and potential aggression from resident females. The findings provide new insights into the evolutionary roots of social movement.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complexities of modern weather forecasting and why public perception of its accuracy sometimes lags behind scientific reality. While a one-day forecast is now correct over 90% of the time, challenges remain due to Chaos Theory, where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating vast amounts of data in a simple format also creates difficulties. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which can process historical data to make predictions faster and more granularly, though experts note it may struggle with predicting unprecedented climate events.</p>
