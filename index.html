          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with stories including counter-terrorism police raids across England, resulting in multiple arrests related to a major terror plot. The Daily Telegraph notes these arrests, involving Iranian men, have sparked renewed calls for the government to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. Other papers focus on the political fallout from Reform UK's success in local elections, with the government considering measures to tackle immigration. The Financial Times highlights pressure on the prime minister to reverse winter fuel allowance cuts following Reform's electoral gains. The Daily Mirror and Daily Express feature VE day commemorations and a Ukrainian veteran's plea for continued British support. Finally, the Daily Star humorously reports on President Trump's budget cuts impacting the search for aliens.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, best known for his role as Tom Brewster in the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94. In "Sugarfoot," Hutchins played a comically genteel sheriff who preferred cherry soda to whiskey and abhorred violence. After the show's success, Hutchins faced challenges finding consistent work in Hollywood, leading him to become a traveling clown in 1973. He embraced the role, traveling globally and finding new meaning in comic performance, emphasizing the importance of acting seriously to make people laugh. Hutchins also appeared in Elvis Presley films and wrote essays about his life in show business.</p>

          <p>Garment factories in Guangzhou, China, are facing significant challenges due to rising trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. These factories, which rely heavily on exports through platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu, are seeing declining orders and considering relocation to other provinces or countries with lower labor costs. The tariffs, combined with decreasing domestic consumer spending, have created a difficult environment for these businesses, leading to suspended production lines and closures.

          <p>A recent government survey indicates that foreign visitors to Japan are most frustrated by the scarcity of public trash bins, particularly at train stations. This issue, cited by nearly 22% of surveyed visitors, forces tourists to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public areas is attributed to safety concerns following past terror attacks. Littering in tourist spots has become a significant concern due to the lack of disposal options. The survey also highlighted communication issues and overcrowding as other inconveniences for visitors.</p>

Economists warn that this influx of discounted goods could erode profitability and weigh on employment, further weakening consumer demand.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a decline following OPEC Plus's decision to increase oil production, despite concerns that President Trumpâ€™s trade war would curb demand. The price decrease reflects market apprehension about potential oversupply and reduced global economic activity. This decision comes as global trade tensions continue to influence energy markets and economic forecasts. The move by OPEC Plus aims to balance supply with anticipated demand, but the impact of trade policies remains a significant factor.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking officials in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) does not indicate weak control by President Xi Jinping. The campaign's impact on the military's readiness and modernization is considered limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor. Recent actions include the removal of Central Military Commission (CMC) member Miao Hua and investigations into former defense ministers, highlighting the focus on rooting out corruption within the military's top ranks.</p>

          <p>As the Catholic Church prepares to elect a new pope following the death of Pope Francis, the Vatican is meticulously organizing the traditional smoke signal system to communicate the election's outcome to the world. The process involves installing two stoves inside the Sistine Chapel, one for burning ballots and another for generating the smoke signals, connected to a chimney that leads to the outside. Technicians use specific chemical compounds to produce either black or white smoke, ensuring clarity and avoiding ambiguity. The system requires careful engineering and testing to prevent malfunctions and maintain the tradition's integrity.</p>
