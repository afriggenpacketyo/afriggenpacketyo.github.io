          <p>Self-custody of bitcoin presents unique security challenges, with global events like wildfires and wars highlighting the need for robust protection. While third-party custodial options offer convenience, they also carry risks of hacks and fraud. Multi-signature setups and diversified storage approaches can mitigate the risks of single-point failure. Unexpected death of the bitcoin owner is also a significant consideration. Companies like Coinbase and Block are developing solutions that merge convenience with enhanced security.</p>
