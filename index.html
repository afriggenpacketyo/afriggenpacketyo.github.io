        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, the conservative leader in Germany, fell short of the required majority in the initial parliament vote to become chancellor, securing only 310 of the 630 votes needed, despite his coalition holding enough seats. This unexpected outcome is considered a significant setback for Merz, especially after winning Germany's federal elections two and a half months prior. The Bundestag now has 14 days to elect Merz or another candidate, with the Social Democrat SPD potentially responsible for the dissent due to unhappiness with the coalition deal. Merz's failure undermines his ambition to provide stability after the previous government's collapse, though colleagues plan to nominate him again. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>President Trump is once again targeting sanctuary cities, reigniting a legal battle over federal funding. He issued an executive order to withhold funds, accusing these cities of crimes like conspiracy and obstruction of justice. While Democrats previously unified to defend sanctuary policies, there is now less uniform opposition, reflecting internal disagreements on immigration. A federal judge struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, but further legal challenges are expected, with the issue potentially reaching the Supreme Court. California's Attorney General is reviewing the legality of the order, emphasizing the state's focus on public safety over immigration enforcement. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are scheduled to meet at the White House, amidst strained relations due to tariffs and annexation suggestions. Carney won his election with an anti-Trump message, and this meeting follows his initial decision to visit Europe first, a break from tradition. The meeting aims to balance standing up for Canada while avoiding conflict with Trump, with Carney cautioning against expecting immediate breakthroughs on a new trade deal. Separately, the Justice Department is seeking to dismiss a case restricting abortion access, and Trump announced a 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to offer $5,000 "baby bonuses" to encourage Americans to have more children is unlikely to succeed, according to experts, who cite unaffordable healthcare, soaring housing costs, inaccessible childcare, and a lack of federal parental leave mandates as significant disincentives. While US birthrates are declining, they remain in line with other developing countries, and concerns about social security can be addressed through other means.

          <p>Americans are increasingly pushing back against the expansion of tipping culture, with gratuities falling from a pandemic peak as tip requests become ubiquitous in unexpected places. The rise of electronic point-of-sale systems is contributing to "tip-creep," prompting some consumers to reduce or eliminate tips in certain situations. While some individuals are choosing to tip more generously due to economic hardships, others are opting for a "countercultural" approach by not tipping at all in establishments covered by regular minimum wage laws. President Trump's proposal to eliminate taxes on tips has drawn criticism for potentially incentivizing the spread of tipping culture and low wages. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>A federal appellate panel is set to consider cases involving two international students, Rumeysa Ozturk and Mohsen Mahdawi, who face removal from the U.S. after expressing criticism of Israel. The Trump administration revoked Ozturk's student visa, while Mahdawi was detained during a citizenship interview. Lower court judges have issued orders in favor of the students, but the administration is seeking to pause these orders. The cases raise concerns about free speech and the government's response to pro-Palestinian protests. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>This article argues that Congress's weakness has created a vacuum that encourages presidential and judicial overreach, resulting in a disordered political system. The author traces the decline of congressional stature to the centralization of authority in the hands of leaders and the rise of performative partisanship. The author contends that Congress's passivity renders much of what happens in government largely symbolic and suggests that addressing the overreach of the other branches requires first changing what members of Congress want.

          <p>The growing political divide between young men and women is not solely due to culture wars but also economic shifts. The decline of manufacturing jobs, traditionally held by men, has led to job insecurity and more regressive gender norms. As the labor market split into lower-paying "manual" occupations and higher-paying "cognitive" jobs, men without college degrees struggled to adapt. The crisis of masculinity presents an opportunity to redefine men's role in an inclusive way, focusing on caretaking and producing. Optimism score: 50</p>
