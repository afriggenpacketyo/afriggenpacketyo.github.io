          <h2>Hershey Announces Significant Price Hikes Due to Unprecedented Cocoa Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 18:58:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company is set to implement a low double-digit price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the soaring cost of cocoa as the primary driver. The company attributes the spike in cocoa prices to a global shortage caused by unfavorable weather conditions and disease affecting crops in West Africa, a major production region. In response, Hershey plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of a broader strategy to expand into other snacking categories. The price changes are expected to roll out to retailers over the next 90 days.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. According to officials, indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent proposal for a 60-day truce. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli forces within Gaza during the ceasefire. The Trump administration is described as cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough that could lead to the release of hostages and an influx of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is deliberately purging women from senior military leadership positions. It cites the recent removal of Vice Admiral Yvette Davids as head of the U.S. Naval Academy, following the firings of other high-ranking female officers like Admiral Lisa Franchetti and Admiral Linda Fagan. The author contends these actions reflect Hegseth's documented belief that women are a distracting influence in the military, sending a chilling message that their advancement is unwelcome. The piece frames the trend as a regressive form of social engineering.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on home sales, a move that would significantly alter real estate taxation. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in profit from their taxable income, a threshold unchanged since 1997. Proponents argue that removing the tax would unlock housing inventory by encouraging older homeowners to sell, while critics contend it would primarily benefit wealthy individuals and could further inflate home prices. The proposal aims to address market stagnation but raises concerns about housing affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded its investigation into the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of the former U.S. Representative. The final report identifies several contributing factors, including the aircraft being overweight for takeoff with a load of moose meat. Additionally, a set of moose antlers affixed to the wing strut created significant drag and a weight imbalance. These factors, combined with downdrafts and turbulent conditions, likely resulted in the pilot losing control of the aircraft in the remote Alaskan terrain.</p>

          <p>More than six months after devastating wildfires swept through Los Angeles, the remains of another victim have been discovered in Altadena, bringing the total death toll to 31. The remains were found on La Venezia Court and confirmed to be human by the medical examiner's office. This individual was the 19th victim of the Eaton fire, one of two major blazes that also destroyed over 16,000 structures. Officials note that identifying victims from such incidents is a complex and time-consuming process involving DNA, dental records, and other forensic methods.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the U.N.'s cultural and scientific agency, for the second time. The State Department cited the organization's advancement of "divisive social and cultural causes" and its focus on a "globalist, ideological agenda" as reasons for the departure. The administration also reiterated its objection to UNESCO's admission of Palestine as a member state in 2011. The withdrawal, which is expected to take effect at the end of 2026, reverses the Biden administration's decision to rejoin the agency in 2023.</p>

          <p>Human rights advocates and doctors are calling for the immediate closure of a controversial migrant detention facility in Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," citing appalling and inhumane conditions.

As the government phases out other repayment plans, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers, who will also receive a $50 monthly credit per qualifying dependent.

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's recent, increasingly bizarre social media activity reflects a state of desperation as he struggles to control the narrative around his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. The article points to a weekend spree of over 30 posts, including strange AI-generated videos and angry rants, as evidence of a president lashing out defensively. The author suggests that unlike in the past, Trump's posts are not effectively shaping reality but instead show him retreating into a fantasy world where he is powerful and his enemies are jailed, a concerning sign of psychological unwellness.</p>
