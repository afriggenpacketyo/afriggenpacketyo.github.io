          <p>Despite Elon Musk's backing, Donald Trump's views on climate change and clean energy, particularly electric vehicles, remain unchanged, highlighting a persistent political divide. Musk, who initially participated in White House councils, left after Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. The article suggests that even when aligned, Musk and Trump couldn't alter the political perception of electric cars, with Republicans increasingly viewing clean tech unfavorably, with the exception of nuclear energy. The article concludes that broader political divides influence how people perceive technologies aimed at limiting climate change, indicating that more than just endorsements are needed to shift opinions.

          <p>The UK government is struggling to reduce foreign aid spending on hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, with plans to allocate £2.2 billion this financial year, only slightly less than the previous year's £2.3 billion. This money, intended for overseas development assistance, is primarily used to cover accommodation costs. The Home Office aims to reduce reliance on hotels by expediting asylum decisions and increasing dispersal accommodation. Critics argue that diverting aid to domestic asylum costs undermines humanitarian efforts and development priorities abroad.</p>

          <p>The German government will ask the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to rule on the legality of migrant turnbacks at the border, following a Berlin court ruling that deemed the refusal of entry to three Somali nationals unlawful.

          <p>A Utah judge ruled that Ralph Leroy Menzies, a convicted killer with dementia, is competent enough to be executed. Menzies was convicted in 1988 for the 1986 killing of Maurine Hunsaker. Despite his cognitive decline, the judge stated that Menzies understands what is happening and why he faces execution. Menzies' lawyers plan to appeal, arguing his dementia prevents him from understanding his punishment, while the victim's family expresses relief that justice will finally be served.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support for fiscal responsibility, the US national debt continues to rise, with a new bill threatening to add trillions more. Economists have long expressed concerns, and ratings agencies have downgraded the US credit rating, citing persistent deficits and rising interest costs. While there is a debt ceiling, it has repeatedly been raised or suspended, sparking legislative battles. One expert suggests that when faced with prioritizing deficit reduction or an expensive policy, policymakers often prioritize the latter, but it is important to avoid big mistakes that are hard to reverse.

          <p>Georgia's fetal 'personhood' law is being tested in the case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant woman on life support, raising questions about whether the law mandates keeping her on life support. The law, which grants fetuses the same rights as a person, has sparked debate among conservatives and politicians regarding its application in such medical situations. While some argue the law requires maintaining life support to save the fetus, others contend that removing life support is not equivalent to abortion.

While producers suggest a reasonable price of 3,000 yen per 5 kg, consensus on an appropriate price level remains elusive.</p>

          <p>MI5 misled its watchdog, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), about a neo-Nazi spy case after initially lying in court. IPCO rewrote a report on the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent after MI5 provided false information. The Security Service has since apologized to IPCO for the false statements, raising concerns about accountability and oversight.</p>
