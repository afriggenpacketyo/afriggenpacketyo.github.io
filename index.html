          <p>President Trump's impending 25% tariff on imported vehicles is prompting some consumers to purchase cars before the levies take effect.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sharp reduction in international aid to Afghanistan, particularly the suspension of USAID funding, has led to a significant increase in maternal and infant mortality.  The closure of numerous health clinics due to funding cuts has left women in remote areas with limited access to essential healthcare.  Midwives report a rise in preventable deaths due to lack of timely care.  This situation highlights the devastating consequences of aid cuts on vulnerable populations and the lack of prioritization for women's health.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Third Term Comments: A Constitutional Conundrum</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's comments about a potential third term raise constitutional concerns. While he claims to be serious, his statements are inconsistent and lack any concrete plan to circumvent the 22nd Amendment.  The mere suggestion of a third term, regardless of feasibility, is unsettling and warrants close attention.  The absence of any concrete steps towards a third term, however, prevents it from being an immediate crisis, but still is a cause for concern.</p>
