          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose 30% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, with the new duties set to begin on August 1. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump cited persistent trade deficits and national security concerns as the primary reasons for the move. The announcement has drawn immediate concern from the EU and Mexico, who warned of disruptions to supply chains and have signaled they may implement proportionate countermeasures.

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash has uncovered a chilling detail: both of the aircraft's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position just seconds after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they initiated the cut-off, with the other pilot denying the action, deepening the mystery. Investigators are now focused on analyzing the cockpit recordings to determine if the cause was intentional, pilot error, or a critical mechanical failure.</p>

          <p>New child safety rules under the UK's Online Safety Act are set to take effect, legally obligating tech platforms to prevent children from accessing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The regulations will require platforms to implement age-verification systems, with significant fines for non-compliance. While the move is a long-awaited step for safety campaigners, critics and officials acknowledge that the law may already need updates to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies like AI.</p>

          <p>Political analysts are examining President Trump's approach to federal disaster response, particularly following the recent devastating floods in central Texas. A panel on "Washington Week" noted that while Trump can be effective at mobilizing government resources, his style differs from past presidents. He tends to focus on promoting his administration's response and relies more heavily on state and local officials, often lacking the personal, empathetic connection with victims that his predecessors displayed.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump recently posted on social media that he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of actress Rosie O’Donnell, a longtime critic, calling her a "Threat to Humanity." O’Donnell, who was born in New York, responded by calling Trump a "danger to the nation." Legal scholars affirm that the president does not have the authority to revoke the citizenship of a U.S.-born individual, as it is protected by the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's journey to the Club World Cup final presents a mix of significant benefits and drawbacks. The club is set to earn over £80 million in prize money, which helps offset major transfer spending. However, the tournament has involved extensive travel, a shortened pre-season, and the risk of player injuries and fatigue ahead of the Premier League season. The trip has also given the manager a chance to integrate new signings and test tactical systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new book and accompanying docuseries, author James Patterson delves into the psychology of Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. Patterson posits that Kohberger, an arrogant and socially inept criminology student, believed he could execute the perfect crime. However, his plan was undone by what Patterson calls "tunnel vision," leading him to make a critical error: leaving a knife sheath with his DNA at the crime scene.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of the "America Party," a new political venture aimed at breaking the Republican-Democratic duopoly by capturing a small number of key congressional seats. However, political science experts express strong skepticism about its potential for success. They argue that third parties historically have more impact by influencing the major parties on specific issues rather than winning elections, and note that Musk's high personal unpopularity and the party's undefined platform are major obstacles.</p>

The article likens skepticism about gender-affirming care to manufactured doubt on issues like climate change and advocates for acceptance to prevent needless suffering for trans youth.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, the first recorded death from the disease in the state since 2007. Plague is a rare bacterial infection typically transmitted to humans by fleas from infected rodents. While treatable with antibiotics, the pneumonic form, which infects the lungs, is the most severe and easily spread. Officials advise residents to use caution around wildlife, especially in rural areas.</p>
