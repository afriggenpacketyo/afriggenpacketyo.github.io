          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the European Union is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia, focusing on phasing out Russian fossil fuels and targeting the country's shadow oil fleet. The statement also included a warning about the EU's complex relationship with China, emphasizing the need to de-risk diplomatically and economically without completely decoupling. This move signals a continued hardening of the EU's stance on Russia's aggression while navigating the strategic challenges posed by Beijing's global influence.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans face a potential "huge premium shock" in 2026 if Congress does not extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that are set to expire. According to research group KFF, the end of these subsidies would cause average premiums to rise by about 75%, affecting approximately 22 million people who currently receive them. The enhanced tax credits, introduced during the pandemic, have been credited with driving the U.S. uninsured rate to a historic low, and their expiration could lead to millions losing coverage.

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is facing a critical trial on charges of forging his university diploma, a conviction for which could disqualify him from future presidential elections. A university degree is a constitutional requirement for the presidency, and a guilty verdict could result in a prison sentence and a political ban. This case is one of several legal challenges against Imamoglu, which his supporters and party claim are politically motivated attempts to eliminate a powerful opponent ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>A significant debate is unfolding within the Democratic party regarding the best strategy to counter President Trump's second term, centering on whether to adhere to traditional political norms or adopt more confrontational tactics. One faction, dubbed "Team Normal," advocates for focusing on popular "kitchen table" issues to win elections, assuming the political system's rules still apply. In contrast, "Team Abnormal" argues that the current political emergency requires direct resistance and procedural obstruction to stall what they see as authoritarian moves, believing this approach can both protect democracy and mobilize voters.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Originalism Has Stifled Constitutional Amendment Process</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a historical analysis arguing that the rise of originalism, a judicial philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, has effectively killed the practice of amending the U.S. Constitution. It traces how political movements, particularly conservatives, shifted from pursuing formal amendments on issues like abortion and budgets to seeking constitutional change through judicial appointments and interpretation. This shift has increased the political polarization of the Supreme Court, undermined the democratic process of amendment, and contributed to a state of constitutional stagnation.</p>

          <p>The European Union will suspend most financial payments to Israel in response to the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Citing the catastrophic images of civilians killed and a man-made famine, she announced that bilateral support would be put on hold, with exemptions for civil society initiatives and the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum. This decision comes as Israel faces global criticism for its military operations in Gaza, which have resulted in over 64,500 Palestinian deaths.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales has suggested that the practice of recording non-crime hate incidents is "no longer required" and can be handled differently. This system records acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but that do not meet the threshold of a criminal offense. The watchdog argued that the policy places police in a difficult position and that people should be allowed to speak openly without fear of legal repercussions, sparking a debate over the balance between free speech and monitoring potential escalations of hate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, ruling that she has shown a strong likelihood that her removal violated the law. Judge Jia Cobb stated that the "for cause" provision for removing a governor likely applies to conduct while in office, not to the pre-service mortgage fraud allegations Trump cited. This ruling marks a significant moment in the legal battle over the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference, allowing Cook to remain in her role as the lawsuit proceeds.</p>

This year's list is noted for its geographic diversity, with only one London-based act, as the ceremony moves to Newcastle for the first time to address criticisms of being too London-centric.</p>

          <p>China's State Council has approved the establishment of a national nature reserve at Scarborough Shoal, a contested feature in the South China Sea also claimed by the Philippines.

This decision follows China's recent publication of new base points around the feature, further asserting its sovereignty claims in the strategically important waterway.</p>

          <p>French authorities have confirmed that two children and one adult died while attempting to cross the English Channel in a small boat off the coast of Calais. The vessel was reportedly carrying 38 people, and the victims were likely crushed at the bottom of the overcrowded boat. This tragedy adds to the more than 20 lives lost in the Channel this year, highlighting the ongoing dangers of these crossings. The incident occurred as the UK government faces mounting pressure over the record number of small boat arrivals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed removing the £100 limit on contactless card payments, allowing banks and card providers to set their own caps, which could potentially be unlimited. The move aims to align card payments with the unrestricted limits already available on smartphone digital wallets and reduce "payment friction" for consumers. While the proposal raises concerns about fraud, the FCA states that providers would only permit higher values for low-risk transactions and would be liable for any fraudulent losses, ensuring consumer protection remains in place.</p>

          <p>While the Atlantic Basin is currently quiet, the hurricane season has reached its climatological peak on September 10, and forecasters anticipate a significant increase in storm activity later this month and in October. Experts from NOAA and Colorado State University predict that large-scale environmental conditions, including warmer sea surface temperatures and more favorable wind shear, will support tropical cyclone development. So far, the season has produced six named storms, but historical data shows that the busiest period often occurs from late August through mid-October.</p>

While Lachlan has been CEO of Fox Corp. during recent controversies, observers note he has a more hands-off leadership style compared to his father's active "kingmaker" role in politics.</p>
