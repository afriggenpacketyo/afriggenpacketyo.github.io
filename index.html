          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi as she faces growing criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The backlash stems from a Justice Department memo which concluded there was "no incriminating client list" or evidence of blackmail in the Epstein files. This finding disappointed many who had been promised major revelations, leading to a public feud and highlighting a division within the administration over the handling of the sensitive case.</p>

          <p>Renewed heavy rainfall in central Texas has forced a pause in the search for victims from the catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe River, which has already claimed at least 129 lives. Authorities issued new flash flood warnings on Sunday, going door-to-door in some areas to alert residents of the danger as waterways are expected to surge again. The severe weather is complicating an already devastating situation, with emergency crews conducting high-water rescues and urging residents to seek higher ground.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which sees the artist return to his R&B foundations with a sound that is raw, quirky, and deeply personal. The album moves away from his polished pop hits, instead offering spacey, cooled-out grooves and improvisatory-feeling tracks that reflect a recent period of personal change and tumult for the singer. The project is being noted for its emotional frankness and for adapting to the idiosyncratic vibe of modern pop music.</p>

          <p>Two young men, 20-year-old U.S. citizen Sayfollah Musallet and 23-year-old Mohammed al-Shalabi, were killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in what their families describe as an attack by Israeli settlers. The incident occurred near Ramallah, with families stating the men were beaten and shot, and that medical assistance was blocked from reaching them for hours. The U.S. State Department is aware of the death of the American citizen, as the event adds to a documented increase in settler violence in the region.</p>

          <p>A man in Goodyear, Arizona, is facing repeated $100 fines from his homeowners association for placing a cooler of free bottled water outside his home during the state's dangerous triple-digit heat. The man, David Martin, says the water is for delivery drivers, children, and anyone else in need of hydration. The HOA's legal counsel stated that while providing water is not an issue, the community's rules prohibit advertising it with a portable ice chest, sparking a local dispute that has led to a recall petition against the HOA board.</p>

          <p>Iran's state-affiliated Fars news agency has reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian was slightly injured during an Israeli attack on a secret underground facility in Tehran last month. According to the unverified report, the strikes trapped top officials, and the president suffered leg injuries while escaping through an emergency shaft. This claim follows Pezeshkian's recent accusation that Israel tried to kill him, and it raises questions about potential intelligence breaches within Iran's security apparatus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of U.S. government data reveals a significant disconnect between President Trump's rhetoric about deporting dangerous criminals and the reality of who is being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The statistics show that over 71% of the nearly 58,000 people currently in ICE detention have no criminal convictions. Of those who do have a criminal record, a small fraction have been convicted of the high-level violent crimes that the president frequently highlights to justify his aggressive immigration enforcement agenda.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the Trump administration's response to the Texas floods, pushing back against criticism of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Noem asserted that President Trump's goal is not to eliminate the agency but to "remake" it to be more efficient and better support state-led disaster responses. Her comments follow reports of unanswered calls and expired contracts at FEMA call centers during the crisis, which she dismissed as politically motivated "fake news."</p>

          <p>An Israeli air strike in central Gaza killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to fill water containers at a tanker truck. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating that a "technical error" caused a munition to fall dozens of meters away from its intended target, an Islamic Jihad militant. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians and has launched a review into the strike, which occurred amid an escalation of aerial attacks across the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has affirmed that President Trump is serious about imposing new tariffs on Mexico and the European Union if current trade deals are not improved to his satisfaction. The statement reinforces the administration's hardline stance on trade, coming just as the EU announced it would delay its own retaliatory tariffs until August 1 in hopes of negotiating a solution. Hassett's comments suggest that the threat of a significant trade escalation remains, pending the outcome of ongoing talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the Trump administration's proposed 50% tariff against Brazil, framing it as part of a comprehensive global strategy. When questioned about the move, given that the U.S. maintains a trade surplus with Brazil, Hassett argued that the tariffs are necessary to encourage the onshoring of production. He stated that this addresses a national security risk posed by a large overall trade deficit and prevents transshipping that could undermine U.S. objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Senate homeland security committee describes the attempted assassination of Donald Trump as a result of a “cascade of preventable failures” by the Secret Service. Published one year after the event, the findings highlight significant mishandling of communications, the denial of extra security requests for the rally, and a subsequent lack of accountability. The committee, chaired by Senator Rand Paul, concluded that the situation was inexcusable and that the disciplinary actions taken so far do not reflect the severity of the security lapses.</p>
