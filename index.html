          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a 42% drop in second-quarter net income, falling short of Wall Street's expectations, which caused its stock to fall by approximately 9%. Despite the profit dip, the airline noted that travel demand has begun to stabilize after a period of weakness, particularly in the domestic market. In response to changing consumer behavior and economic uncertainty, Southwest is overhauling its business model by introducing assigned seating and new fare structures. The company also announced a new $2 billion share buyback program for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two men, Jordan R. Willis and Ivory Carson, are set to appear in a Missouri court for a preliminary hearing on second-degree felony-murder charges related to the deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans. The victims—Ricky Johnson, David Harrington, and Clayton McGeeney—were discovered deceased from a combination of fentanyl and cocaine toxicity in Willis's backyard in January 2024. Prosecutors allege the suspects supplied the fatal drugs, and the hearing will determine if there is sufficient evidence for a trial. This case has drawn significant local attention due to the unusual and tragic circumstances of the deaths.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop Highly Resilient Aerogel for Advanced Aircraft Shielding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:50:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from Zhejiang University in China has engineered a new type of aerogel with exceptional toughness and elasticity, potentially revolutionizing shielding for aircraft operating in extreme conditions. Traditional aerogels are excellent insulators but are mechanically fragile, limiting their application. The new method, which involves using graphene oxide, creates a unique internal dome-like cellular structure, resulting in a material that is both strong and lightweight. This innovative preparation technique can be adapted to hundreds of different formulations, opening up new possibilities for advanced material science.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 8% following the announcement of its second consecutive quarterly decline in automobile sales, with automotive revenue dropping 16% year-over-year. CEO Elon Musk warned of potentially "rough quarters" ahead, citing the expiration of federal EV tax credits and increasing competition from lower-cost manufacturers in Europe and China. The company did not provide official guidance for the remainder of the year, leading some analysts to interpret this as a signal that management no longer expects volume growth in 2025.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that China is unwilling to fully stop the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals because it views the issue as a source of political leverage over the United States. While China has previously demonstrated it can crack down on the trade when incentivized, its cooperation has been inconsistent and often tied to the broader state of U.S.-China relations. The analysis suggests that despite the devastating human cost in America, Beijing treats its control over the chemical supply as a strategic tool, withholding full enforcement to extract concessions from Washington.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Walking 7,000 Steps Daily Offers Significant Health Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:08:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major study published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Researchers argue this is a more realistic and evidence-based target for many people than the widely promoted but unscientific goal of 10,000 steps. The analysis of data from over 160,000 adults found that even modest increases in daily steps, from 2,000 to 4,000, were associated with better health outcomes, with benefits tending to level off after 7,000 steps for most conditions.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on the influential "Full Send Podcast" hosted by the Nelk Boys, a media group popular in the right-leaning "manosphere." During the hour-long interview, Netanyahu discussed the war in Gaza, criticized pro-Palestinian supporters, and praised Donald Trump, while also engaging in lighthearted banter about fast food. The appearance was described by a commentator as an effort to reach a younger audience amid declining support for Israel, but it drew significant backlash, with critics condemning the normalization of a leader facing war crime allegations amid a humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian explores the concept of "citizenship insecurity," a feeling of estrangement and disillusionment with American values that has grown for some since the 2024 election. This sentiment is not necessarily about immediate physical danger but a sense that the U.S. passport no longer represents the ideals of democracy and human rights it once symbolized. The article interviews several individuals, including naturalized citizens and academics, who feel a profound instability and are considering options like dual citizenship due to the country's political direction and the erosion of social contracts.</p>

          <p>The National Governors Association (NGA), a historically bipartisan body, is reportedly splintering as some Democratic governors express frustration with the organization's response to the Trump administration's policies. At least two Democratic governors plan to stop paying dues, citing the NGA's tepid reaction to federal overreach on issues like the deployment of the National Guard and funding disbursements. The growing division highlights the challenges of maintaining bipartisan consensus in a highly polarized political environment and questions the organization's ongoing effectiveness as a collective voice for states.</p>

          <p>In a return to monetary easing, Turkey's central bank cut its key interest rate by three percentage points to 43%, a larger reduction than markets had anticipated. This is the first rate cut since April and suggests the bank is confident in its progress on tackling the country's high inflation rate, which has been steadily decreasing. The central bank stated that its tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until price stability is achieved. Some analysts viewed the move as a dovish surprise, questioning if policy is tight enough to meet year-end inflation targets. (not investment advice)</p>
