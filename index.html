          <p>China is increasingly relaxing its visa-free entry regulations to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector. The article outlines five methods for travelers to enter mainland China without a visa, including transit stays of up to 10 days for citizens of 55 nations. Recent updates also allow Russian citizens to stay for up to 30 days visa-free. These policy changes aim to lower traditional entry hurdles, which previously involved extensive paperwork and fees.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa after his "incendiary actions" at a pro-Palestinian protest in New York. Petro reportedly urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders and called for an army larger than the U.S. military. This incident further strained U.S.-Colombia relations, which have soured under Petro, especially after his criticism of U.S. anti-drug operations and the decertification of Colombia as an anti-drug ally. The move underscores heightened diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>The DEA Atlanta Field Division has opened a new lab to expedite the processing of federal drug seizures in Georgia, significantly increasing efficiency in combating the Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG). This in-house lab reduces drug testing times from days to minutes, crucial for prosecuting cases. Recent operations saw the seizure of over 1,000 pounds of meth linked to CJNG, with suspects identified as Mexican nationals. The DEA emphasizes targeting the cartel's entire network, from production to money laundering, to prevent its expansion.</p>

          <p>Hungary is experiencing increasingly aggressive public discourse and media pressure as elections approach, with a recent tragedy involving a police chief's suicide linked to pro-government media attacks. Critics, including the Loupe Theater Troupe, protest against the government's "neurotoxin of propaganda" and the use of taxpayer money for disinformation campaigns. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party maintains strong control over traditional and digital media, inciting hatred against perceived enemies. This environment raises concerns about media freedom and the future of democratic debate, with little improvement expected.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is set to reimpose sweeping economic and military sanctions on Iran, a decade after they were lifted as part of the international nuclear deal. This action follows accusations from the UK, France, and Germany that Iran failed to uphold its commitments, triggering a 30-day diplomatic resolution mechanism. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the move as "unfair" and "illegal," despite assurances his country would not seek nuclear weapons. The re-escalation of sanctions, including an arms embargo and ban on uranium enrichment, adds significant strain to an already tense international situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue its freeze of over $4 billion in foreign aid, which was previously approved by Congress. The conservative-majority court cited that the "asserted harms" to Trump's foreign affairs conduct outweighed potential harm to aid recipients, though this is not a final determination. Liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over spending. This move continues the administration's policy of drastically downsizing U.S. foreign aid, raising concerns about global public health and humanitarian efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Minnesota has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent ally of President Trump, defamed election technology company Smartmatic with false claims of rigging the 2020 presidential election. The judge found 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely asserted Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. While defamation was established, the question of "actual malice"—whether Lindell knew his statements were false or acted with reckless disregard—will be determined in future proceedings to assess damages. Lindell maintains his "unwavering belief" in his claims and vows to continue his fight against voting machines.</p>

Despite a recent win against the Seattle Mariners, manager Dave Roberts confirmed Stewart's procedure, which will sideline him for the remainder of the current season. Stewart had been dealing with persistent shoulder soreness following a minor-league rehab stint. While the surgery is expected to allow him to pitch for most of next season, his absence creates a notable void in the Dodgers' relief corps, leaving them to rely on other pitchers to fill the gap.</p>
