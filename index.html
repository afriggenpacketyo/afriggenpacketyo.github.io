          <h2>UK Economy Shows Unexpected Growth in First Quarter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy exceeded expectations by growing 0.7% in the first three months of the year, primarily driven by the services sector and a significant increase in production. This strong growth occurred just before the US imposed import tariffs and UK employer taxes increased, leading analysts to caution that this rate of expansion is unlikely to persist. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the strength of the UK economy compared to other major nations, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employer's National Insurance payments, terming it a 'jobs tax' that could jeopardize economic progress. Some businesses are absorbing US tariffs to maintain stable prices, while others are delaying decisions due to economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has approved a $433 million joint venture between Apple supplier Foxconn and HCL Group to establish a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, with operations expected to commence by 2027. The facility will produce display driver chips for mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and PCs, with a capacity of 20,000 wafers and 36 million chips per month. This deal aligns with Apple suppliers' increasing shift towards India amid trade tensions between the US and China. India's "Semiconductor Mission" aims to create a robust chip and display ecosystem, making this Foxconn venture the sixth semiconductor unit under the plan.</p>

          <p>A European Union trade official stated that the EU has no interest in reviving the stalled Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China, citing steadily deteriorating trade ties and increasing barriers for businesses over the past 15 to 20 years. Despite lobbying efforts from Chinese officials and the recent lifting of Chinese sanctions on some members of the European Parliament, the EU's stance remains unchanged. The CAI, initially seen as a landmark deal, faced delays in ratification in 2021 due to tit-for-tat sanctions related to alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul announced that Berlin is willing to align with US President Trump's call for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP.

          <p>Ola Aina believes that Taiwo Awoniyi's injury during a Nottingham Forest match could have been avoided if the assistant referee had raised the offside flag earlier. Awoniyi, who collided with a post while trying to get on the end of a cross from Anthony Elanga, was later placed in an induced coma following surgery for a serious abdominal injury. Aina argues that Elanga was clearly offside, but the flag was not raised until after the play due to a protocol introduced in 2020.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons to address near-record high rice prices caused by a supply shortfall. This measure involves releasing 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. Concerns arise that reducing the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, a third of the appropriate reserve level, could impact the government's response to future poor harvests or natural disasters.

          <p>Three Māori MPs in New Zealand face potential suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a sitting last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka, performed in response to a controversial bill, could have 'intimidated' other lawmakers. Te Pāti Māori criticized the recommendations as a 'warning shot to all of us to fall in line,' while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters accused the trio of being 'out-of-control MPs' who flout the rules.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the U.S. and China, has cautioned that their collective growth is at risk of a significant slowdown, attributing this to tariff tensions and policy uncertainty affecting investment and trade.

The Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit emphasized that the current trade environment, marked by tariff hikes and retaliatory measures, is not conducive to trade, leading to delayed investments and new product launches.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, which experienced a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate this year, but the looming threat of U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry is not anticipated to be a significant factor. The IMF reports that Denmark's economic growth is expected to decline from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026, due to anticipated weakness in export growth. However, most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders, protecting it from potential U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts drove in two runs with a double after Shohei Ohtani was intentionally walked, leading the Dodgers to a 9-3 victory over the Athletics. This was the fifth time that Ohtani has been intentionally walked to face Betts. After the hit Betts made a gesture to the Athletics' dugout in celebration. The Dodgers' offense also included home runs from Ohtani, Andy Pages, and Max Muncy, while Yoshinobu Yamamoto earned the win with a quality start.</p>
