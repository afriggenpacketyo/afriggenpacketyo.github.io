          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would reduce the pace of cuts to its Japanese government bond (JGB) purchases starting in April of next year, while holding the benchmark interest rate steady at 0.5% due to rising economic growth risks. The central bank plans to decrease monthly JGB purchases by approximately 400 billion yen per quarter until March 2026, and then slow the cuts to 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027, targeting a monthly purchase amount of about 2 trillion yen. This adjustment aims to improve the functioning and stability of the JGB markets. Following the announcement, the Nikkei 225 index increased by 0.55%, and the yen strengthened slightly against the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, with spot prices increasing by 30% in 2025. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, contrasting it with assets tied to specific economies. While the dollar index has weakened and yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds have decreased, gold prices have consistently reached new highs, driven by instability and uncertainty, particularly in the Middle East. This shift reflects a growing concern about the future of the U.S. dollar and Treasury market, prompting investors to seek alternative safe havens.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's directives to cancel several National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants were "void" and "illegal." The judge, William Young, stated that the cancellations, which targeted studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law, constituting racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. The ruling comes after two lawsuits were filed against the administration by the American Public Health Association and a group of 16 states, with estimates suggesting up to $1.8 billion in research funding had been cut. The judge ordered the NIH to reinstate the terminated grants, while the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it would explore legal options, including an appeal.</p>

          <p>Southern Water, serving approximately 2.6 million customers across the south of England, has cautioned residents about potential hosepipe bans following the driest spring since 1893. The prolonged dry spell has significantly impacted local chalk streams, including the Test and Itchen rivers, which are primary water sources for the region. The company is advising customers to conserve water by taking shorter showers and allowing lawns to turn brown. Southern Water warned that if river levels continue to decline, stricter measures like hosepipe bans or ceasing the use of the affected streams may be necessary.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully transmitted data from a satellite in stationary orbit to Earth at 1Gbps using a 2-watt laser, which is five times faster than Starlink. The team, led by Wu Jian and Liu Chao, overcame atmospheric turbulence by combining adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR). This "groundbreaking" solution enables high-speed satellite laser downlinks, despite the challenges posed by light scattering in the atmosphere. This technology could potentially allow for the transmission of an HD movie from Shanghai to Los Angeles in under five seconds.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) has authorized the sale of up to $500 million in bonds to cover past alleged sexual misconduct claims. This decision will allow the district to stretch out repayments over 15 years, mitigating the impact on its annual budget and services. The move comes in response to approximately 370 sexual abuse claims filed against LAUSD, dating back to the 1970s, with payouts totaling $302 million in the current fiscal year alone. The district also established its own insurance company to manage future abuse claims.</p>

          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, has reported to a U.S. federal prison after being sentenced for stealing nearly $17 million from the baseball player. Mizuhara received a prison term of four years and nine months and was ordered to surrender himself to authorities. He is being held in a low-security prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, and is likely to be deported to Japan after completing his sentence, as he is not an American citizen. Mizuhara misappropriated the funds from Ohtani's bank account to cover gambling debts and also stole money to buy baseball cards and pay for dental work.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are set to vote on a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. The current law in England and Wales states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain circumstances, requiring approval from two doctors. Recent law changes have allowed women to access pills to terminate pregnancies at home under 10 weeks. Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners.</p>
