          <p>The Department of Education has paused $8 billion in grant funding to Harvard University, citing concerns over the university's management and its failure to combat antisemitism and discrimination. According to a senior official, the Trump administration believes that public confidence in Harvard is at an all-time low. The pause includes medical research funding, and the university is under investigation by multiple agencies, including probes into accusations of undisclosed foreign gifts and discrimination within the Harvard Law Review. Harvard would need to come into agreement with the administration to return to compliance under federal law.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor announced that President Trump's tariff policies are expected to reduce its 2025 profits by approximately $1.5 billion, leading the company to suspend its full-year guidance due to increased uncertainty. The company noted the potential for disruptions to automotive supply chains and retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports. Ford's profit for the first three months of the year declined to $471 million from $1.3 billion the previous year, attributed to lower vehicle sales and production pauses. The company is adapting to changes driven by tariffs, although uncertainty remains regarding tax and emission policies.</p>

          <p>California's tourism reached a record $157.3 billion in spending in 2024, but Governor Newsom anticipates a decline due to President Trump's tariffs, which could lead to a "Trump Slump."

Local businesses in Los Angeles and desert towns that rely on tourism are already experiencing downturns. The governor's office has announced a marketing plan to invite Canadians back to California after recent declines in tourism figures.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to provide strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid, a practice known as red-boxing.

If found in violation, Cuomo could face penalties and lose public matching funds.

          <p>Following a meeting with actor Jon Voight, President Trump announced that he was authorizing the Commerce Department to consider imposing 100% tariffs on films produced outside the United States. Voight and his manager had submitted a proposal to Trump that included the idea of tariffs on foreign films. The announcement sparked confusion and concern in Hollywood, with some fearing the tariffs could cause more harm than good. Trump has since softened his stance, stating he wants to help the industry and will meet with entertainment representatives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with the U.S. Department of Justice's defense of existing rules easing access to the abortion drug mifepristone, a case initiated during the Biden administration. The DOJ filed a brief in Texas federal court urging a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from three Republican-led states on procedural grounds. Despite Trump's past statements, this action suggests that his administration is not prioritizing restrictions on mifepristone access. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary, stated that Trump has requested a study on the safety of abortion pills but has not made a decision on tightening restrictions.</p>
