          <p>A meticulously planned robbery at the Louvre Museum saw thieves steal eight priceless items from the French crown jewels collection. Using a vehicle-mounted lift to access a first-floor gallery, the masked perpetrators threatened guards and escaped on scooters in a matter of minutes. The incident has exposed significant security vulnerabilities, including a broken local alarm and inadequate CCTV coverage, sparking a major police investigation. The theft has been widely condemned by French political figures as a profound loss to the nation's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud provider, experienced a significant outage that disrupted numerous major websites and online services, including Disney+, Reddit, and various banking apps. The issue originated in AWS's main U.S.-East-1 region and was attributed to a DNS problem with its DynamoDB database service. While services were gradually restored, the event highlighted the internet's heavy reliance on a few key infrastructure providers. The outage also impacted Amazon's internal operations, affecting warehouse employees and delivery drivers.</p>

          <p>A career expert and executive coach outlines five key strategies for effectively dealing with a controlling or micromanaging boss. These tactics include submitting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority to make them feel in control, and oversharing information to preemptively satisfy their need for oversight. The article also suggests getting ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." technique to validate their feedback while still asserting one's own ideas. Finally, it advises directly asking for positive feedback to foster a more balanced professional relationship.</p>

          <p>The Colombian government has recalled its ambassador to the United States for consultations after former President Donald Trump made inflammatory remarks about its leader. Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as an "illegal drug leader" and threatened unilateral U.S. action to shut down drug production fields if Colombia did not act immediately. The move follows Petro's condemnation of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel. Petro responded directly to Trump on social media, calling his comments "rude and ignorant."</p>

          <p>The recent brazen jewelry heist at the Louvre is not the first time the world-renowned museum has been targeted by thieves. The most famous incident occurred in 1911 when an employee stole the Mona Lisa, a crime that ironically propelled the painting to global fame after its recovery two years later. Over the decades, other significant thefts have included the diamond-studded sword of King Charles X in 1976 and a landscape painting by Camille Corot in 1998, neither of which has been recovered.

The new policy is intended to provide clearer direction for officers and reduce ambiguity in policing online debates.

          <p>Following the theft of priceless crown jewels from the Louvre Museum, art security experts are weighing in on where the loot might end up. While well-known paintings are difficult to sell, precious metals and gemstones are increasingly targeted because they can be melted down or recut, destroying their historical identity and making them untraceable. However, one former FBI art crimes expert believes these specific pieces are so historically important that the thieves may try to keep them intact. The investigation is exploring links to organized crime networks that procure art for collectors.</p>

          <p>In her posthumously published memoir, Virginia Giuffre provides graphic details of the sexual abuse she endured at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their associates. The book reiterates her allegation of having been forced into sexual encounters with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including one instance she describes as an "orgy" on Epstein's private island. Giuffre also recounts the sadomasochistic abuse she suffered from Epstein and the role Maxwell played in recruiting her. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations and reached a financial settlement with Ms. Giuffre in 2022.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is convening to chart its next five-year economic plan, facing the challenge of balancing industrial policy with the need to stimulate weak domestic consumption. For decades, China's growth was driven by exports and infrastructure, but with those sectors slowing, boosting consumer spending has become more urgent. However, analysts believe Beijing will prioritize government spending on developing high-tech industries, like semiconductors, to achieve technological sovereignty amid geopolitical competition with the U.S. This focus on industrial resilience may leave fewer resources available to address the gloomy mood among Chinese households.

          <p>An article examines the narrative of a "Christian genocide" in Nigeria, which has been amplified by some public figures and organizations citing attacks on Christian communities. The Nigerian government refutes this claim, acknowledging security issues but denying a systematic campaign. Analysts suggest the violence is driven by a complex mix of factors, including land disputes between mostly Christian farmers and Muslim Fulani herders, climate change, and weak governance. While Christian communities have been severely affected, survivors and experts argue that the violence cuts across faiths and oversimplifying it obscures the root causes.</p>

          <p>Due to rising cocoa prices, the maker of McVitie's Penguin and Club bars has altered the recipe, meaning the products can no longer be legally classified as chocolate. The treats are now described as having a "chocolate flavour" coating because the amount of cocoa-derived ingredients has been reduced below the regulatory threshold of 20%. The company, Pladis, made the change to manage costs driven by poor harvests in West Africa.

This move brings Japan in line with over 90 other countries and follows years of debate and campaigning by rights groups.
