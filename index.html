        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly considered firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, despite previous statements indicating no intention to do so. Legally, firing Powell would be contentious, as federal law allows removal of Fed governors only "for cause," and the Supreme Court has specifically exempted the Fed from broader presidential firing powers. Powell himself stated he would not resign if asked, highlighting the ongoing tension between the president and the central bank regarding monetary policy. Trump's criticism centers on interest rate policies, arguing that Powell's caution could harm economic growth, while the Fed prioritizes controlling inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

This has raised concerns about the decline of Confucian ideals like filial piety in modern, fast-paced Chinese society. The incidents highlight a tension between traditional values and the pressures of contemporary life, as well as questions about empathy and societal norms.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests, while also misnaming Senator Alex Padilla as "Jose Padilla." Vance's visit to Los Angeles amid demonstrations over immigration raids underscores the Trump administration's focus on hard-line immigration policies. Newsom's office refuted Vance's claims, stating the governor has consistently condemned violence, and the misnaming of Padilla was deemed intentional, referencing a convicted al-Qaida terrorism plotter with the same name. The situation highlights the ongoing political tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in California.</p>

          <p>Israel is reportedly weighing its options to destroy Iran's underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordow if the U.S. decides against military action. One option involves deploying elite Israeli Air Force commandos to infiltrate and destroy the facility, similar to a past operation in Syria. Experts suggest another approach would be cutting off power to Fordow, disabling the centrifuges. Israel prefers the U.S. to use its bunker-buster bombs, but is willing to act alone if necessary, to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>A gardening simulation game called Grow a Garden has become surprisingly popular, surpassing even adrenaline-filled games like Fortnite in concurrent players. The game, available on the Roblox platform, involves players slowly developing a virtual garden by planting, growing, and selling items. The game's slow pace and competitive elements appeal to many, especially younger players, with some even willing to spend real money to acquire rare items. The game's popularity highlights the appeal of more sedate and patient gaming experiences.</p>

          <p>As summer approaches, the appropriateness of wearing shorts in the office remains a debated topic, even as many companies relax their dress codes. Stylists suggest that wearing shorts to the office depends heavily on the context and the formality of the workplace, with tailored shorts being more acceptable than casual styles. While some companies trust employees to dress professionally and comfortably, others maintain stricter guidelines, especially for client-facing roles. Personal comfort and expression are increasingly valued, but navigating office dress codes requires careful consideration.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict within a two-week window set by President Trump, who will decide whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva, with both sides expressing willingness to continue discussions. The U.S. has offered Iran a civilian nuclear program if it agrees not to enrich uranium on its soil, but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's approval is needed. The situation remains uncertain, with concerns about the functionality of the Iranian government and potential obstacles to direct talks with the U.S.</p>

The administration stated that the decision aligns with President Trump's commitment to enforcing U.S. immigration laws. Trump indicated he would address the effects of his immigration crackdown on the farm and hotel industries, which heavily rely on migrant labor.</p>

          <p>China has launched the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, aiming to become a key architect of new global governance models. Beijing states that existing mechanisms do not adequately represent the interests of developing nations. The establishment of IOMed is intended to fill an institutional gap in international mediation and position Hong Kong as a political bridge to the Global South. The move signals China's ambition to enhance its global prominence and reach out to developing countries.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Makes Changes to ObamaCare, Ends 'Dreamer' Coverage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 17:55:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is shortening ObamaCare's open enrollment period, ending coverage for immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children, and banning plans from covering "sex-trait modification" as an essential health benefit. The administration claims the moves will address fraudulent enrollment and save taxpayers billions of dollars. The federal open enrollment period will run from November 1 through December 31, and states operating their own exchanges will have flexibility to set their own enrollments. The administration projects the rule will save up to $12 billion in 2026.</p>
