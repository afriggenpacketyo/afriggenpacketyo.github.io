The condom, made around 1830 from a sheep's appendix, features an image of a nun and clergymen. The museum acquired the condom to highlight the lighter and darker sides of sexual health during a time when sensual pleasure was intertwined with fears of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The exhibit, titled "Safe Sex?", aims to shed light on underrepresented aspects of 19th-century life.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History made a surprising discovery about the Oort Cloud while preparing a planetarium show.

This unexpected finding, relying on data about celestial object movements and simulations, suggests a more complex shape than a sphere or flattened shell.

          <p>Researchers have discovered that over 90% of popular freshwater fish in Southern California are infected with human-infecting parasites. The parasites, called trematodes, can cause gastrointestinal problems and other health issues. The parasites likely arrived in the U.S. via the Malaysian trumpet snail. Thoroughly cooking freshwater fish can prevent illness. The study also found that many YouTube videos about preparing caught fish do not mention proper cooking or freezing techniques.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a "sustain" phase in the brain that links experiences to emotions. Following an experience, a signal lingers in the brain, generalizing the emotional state. This sustained signal allows the experience to interact with other stimuli, influencing emotional responses. The findings may help explain emotional differences in neuropsychiatric conditions. However, some researchers argue that the lingering signal may not be specific to emotion but could also be involved in other cognitive processes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill could eliminate a popular workaround for the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, impacting certain business owners. The current $10,000 limit on the SALT deduction, enacted in 2017, has led many states to implement pass-through entity (PTE) taxes to bypass the federal limit. The House-approved bill would block specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs) from using the SALT deduction workaround. Some non-SSTB pass-through businesses could still claim an unlimited SALT deduction via the PTE workaround and qualify for a larger qualified business income deduction. (not investment advice)</p>
