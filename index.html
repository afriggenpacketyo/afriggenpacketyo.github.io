          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is set to abandon efforts to overhaul local policing in Minneapolis and Louisville, effectively ending federal oversight of police departments accused of civil rights violations.

The decision is expected to draw consternation from racial justice advocates, particularly as it coincides with the anniversary of George Floyd's death. The article also notes that while local leaders have pledged to continue reforms, the absence of federal oversight is a significant setback for police accountability.</p>
