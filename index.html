          <p>The German government has revised its economic growth forecast to zero for the third consecutive year, primarily due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on imported automobiles, steel, and aluminum. Economy Minister Robert Habeck stated that Germany's export-oriented economy is particularly vulnerable to U.S. trade policy. The tariffs and market turbulence are exacerbating existing challenges such as weak foreign demand and reduced competitiveness. Germany remains the only G7 nation whose economy has not experienced growth in the past two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eight critically endangered Fijian iguanas, rescued from wildlife traffickers in Spain, have arrived at the San Diego Zoo. The iguanas were seized in 2017 and their move to San Diego was authorized by the Fiji government as part of an international effort to help restore the endangered species. The San Diego Zoo is home to the largest captive colony of these reptiles and is leading genetic research efforts to aid their survival, working to determine if the iguanas were poached and from which island they originated.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Regional Energy Pricing</h2>

          <p>Energy secretary Ed Miliband is "considering" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy. He did not set out details of the "zonal pricing" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment. But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households. Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted "absolutely no decision has been made".</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Investing in Critical Mineral Miners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 08:52:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating investing in companies that mine and process critical minerals to reduce U.S. reliance on imports from countries like China, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. The administration is considering equity investments in domestic miners and a sovereign risk insurance fund to protect companies from political changes. The U.S. is also considering stockpiling key critical minerals, similar to the strategic petroleum reserve, to counter China's market dominance.</p>
