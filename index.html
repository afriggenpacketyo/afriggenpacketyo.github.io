          <h2>Lawsuit Filed Against Trump Administration Over Student Loan Repayment Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-19 19:01:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Federation of Teachers sued the Trump administration for halting affordable student loan repayment plans, arguing it violates federal law and harms borrowers.  The lawsuit alleges the administration's actions deny access to affordable payments and block progress toward loan forgiveness, impacting over 12 million borrowers. The Department of Education cites a court injunction as the reason for the pause, but the union contends this interpretation is excessive and that paper applications aren't being processed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its legal battle against a judge's order blocking the deportation of non-citizens under the Alien Enemies Act.  The administration refused to provide details about deportation flights, citing national security concerns, and is considering invoking state secrets privilege.  The case involves allegations of deporting individuals based on suspected gang affiliation, regardless of criminal records in the US, and raises questions about judicial authority over executive branch actions regarding foreign affairs and national security.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order to abolish the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign promise.  The White House claims this will shift education control to families, but the American Federation of Teachers opposes the move, citing public opinion and the department's role in leveling the educational playing field.  While Congress would need to approve the abolishment, some support exists within the Republican party for eliminating the agency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is cutting $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania, citing its policies allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.  The White House linked the decision to Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, but the university maintains compliance with NCAA and Ivy League regulations.  The move has drawn criticism from local officials who argue the funding cuts are a pretext to target the university and the city of Philadelphia.</p>
