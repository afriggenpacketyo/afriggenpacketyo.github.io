          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 13:48:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Play was temporarily stopped during a fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova due to a failure in the new electronic line-calling system. An operator error deactivated the system, causing it to miss a clear "out" call on a crucial point, which was then ordered to be replayed. Pavlyuchenkova, who ultimately won the match, expressed significant frustration, stating a game was "stolen" from her and questioning the umpire's refusal to make a manual call. The incident has sparked debate about the reliability of the automated system, which was introduced at the tournament for the first time this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A "Face the Nation" broadcast featured interviews discussing major national events, including a new tax and spending bill signed by the president and devastating floods in Texas. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett defended the bill, arguing it would stimulate growth and not significantly increase the deficit or cause mass loss of Medicaid coverage, contrary to projections by the CBO and other analysts. In response, Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi criticized the legislation as a "big, ugly bill," predicting it would inflate the deficit, raise interest rates, and harm Americans' access to healthcare. The program also included a segment with filmmaker Ken Burns on the American Revolution.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, named the "America Party," following a public disagreement with President Donald Trump over a recently passed tax and spending bill. Musk, who previously supported Trump, heavily criticized the legislation for what he termed "insane spending" that would increase the national debt. He stated on his social media platform X that the new party aims to challenge the existing "one-party system" and restore freedom. The move creates uncertainty for the 2026 midterm elections, given Musk's vast wealth and potential to fund candidates, and could have repercussions for his businesses that rely on government contracts.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash flooding in central Texas has resulted in a death toll of at least 70 people, with Kerr County being the most severely affected region, reporting 59 fatalities, including 21 children. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the county, enabling federal resources, including FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard, to aid in the ongoing search and rescue operations. Many of the victims were at a summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River, where campers and a counselor are still reported missing. Officials are continuing their search for survivors amid the widespread devastation.</p>

          <p>This article details the complex and lengthy legislative maneuvering required to pass President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" ahead of the July 4th deadline. The process was marked by significant delays, last-minute negotiations, and procedural tactics in both the House and Senate. Key moments included a nearly 16-hour reading of the 940-page bill on the Senate floor and a record-breaking seven-and-a-half-hour vote in the House. The passage ultimately relied on intense negotiations with skeptical Republican members and strategic clock management by party leadership to overcome internal opposition and unified Democratic resistance, culminating in a final House vote just hours before the holiday.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which killed nearly 70 people, have exposed the limitations of current weather forecasting models in the face of the climate crisis. While the National Weather Service issued timely watches and warnings, the rainfall's intensity—exceeding a 1-in-500-year event—was far greater than predicted, overwhelming the region. The analysis suggests that although forecasters knew a major event was possible due to record atmospheric moisture, predicting the precise location and magnitude of such extreme downpours remains a significant challenge. This tragedy underscores the increasing frequency of such events and the urgent need for improved forecasting technology and climate adaptation.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have argued for significant structural changes to effectively counter modern drone warfare. The article suggests that the PLA will likely need to establish specialized counter-drone combat units capable of rapid responses to unmanned aerial threats. This analysis comes as drones have proven to be a decisive factor in recent conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and clashes between Israel and Iran.

          <p>A 24-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of vandalism after portraits in the Windrush Untold Stories exhibition in Brixton, south London, were damaged. The outdoor art installation, which features portraits and stories of the Windrush generation, was attacked on Thursday. While community groups had initially suggested the act was driven by racial hatred, the Metropolitan Police stated that they do not believe it was a hate crime. Police acknowledged the distress the incident caused the community and have been in contact with the exhibition's organizers. The suspect remains in police custody as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has spoken out against recent moves by the White House and Congress to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In an interview, Burns called the decision "foolhardy and misguided," arguing that it is based on a false perception of public media, like PBS and NPR, as being politically biased. He emphasized that PBS is a crucial service, especially in rural areas where it may be the only broadcast signal available, providing essential educational, emergency, and cultural programming. Burns, whose films have aired on PBS for decades, stated that he worries about the future of the public broadcaster if its funding is cut.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are in a critical week of negotiations to secure a trade deal with the United States and avoid President Trump's threatened 50% tariffs on EU imports. With the July 9 deadline looming, uncertainty remains about how the bloc will be treated, creating significant anxiety across European industries. A split has emerged among EU members, with some like Germany favoring a quick deal to prevent a trade war, while France advocates for holding out for a more balanced agreement. The EU now appears to be aiming for a framework agreement similar to the one the UK secured, conceding that a comprehensive deal is likely unattainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR journalist in Gaza has provided a harrowing first-person account of the perilous journey to obtain food from a distribution site supported by the U.S. and Israel. The report describes a "death trap" where thousands of desperate Palestinians face Israeli military fire, armed private contractors, and violent crowds to get rations. The journalist witnessed people being killed and wounded while trying to access the site and was personally threatened by armed thieves. This chaotic and dangerous system, which has replaced more orderly UN distribution, highlights the extreme hunger and lawlessness gripping the territory, forcing civilians to risk their lives for basic sustenance.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in Peru's Barranca province with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city served as a vital trading center, linking ancient coastal communities with societies in the Andes and the Amazon basin. The site, founded between 1800 and 1500 BC, contains 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes. Led by the archaeologist who excavated the Americas' oldest civilization, Caral, the research suggests Peñico provides crucial insights into the society that emerged after the Caral civilization declined, potentially due to climate change.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is handing over audio recordings of the 1985 torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena to the defense team of Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is facing federal prosecution in New York for his alleged role in the killing, which marked a pivotal moment in the U.S. war on drugs. The tapes, which have never been publicly released, are highly sensitive and have long been the subject of controversy.

According to the leader of a Chinese chamber of commerce, local leaders are eager for the economic stimulus and manufacturing projects that Chinese companies can provide. While national-level political rhetoric has created concern among potential investors, officials in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly receptive to Chinese capital, particularly in sectors like agriculture and automotive manufacturing.

          <p>A communication expert and executive coach highlights five common phrases that, despite good intentions, can make a person sound judgmental and erode trust. Phrases such as "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can come across as dismissive or condescending, implying the other person is wrong or illogical. Similarly, using preambles like "To be honest..." can suggest prior dishonesty and put others on the defensive. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" or using "yes, and..." to build on ideas rather than correct them.</p>

          <h2>London's Metropolitan Police Chief Argues Football Clubs Should Contribute to Policing Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 08:31:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has stated that football clubs should help pay for the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. He argued for a "polluter pays approach," questioning why event organizers who require a police presence do not contribute to the cost, which currently diverts resources from local communities. The suggestion comes as part of a broader call by Sir Mark for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger ones to improve efficiency. This proposal has been criticized by sports bodies, who warn it could threaten events and raise ticket prices.</p>
