          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, causing traffic disruptions and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department due to a fallen high-voltage line, occurring shortly after a fire at an electrical substation had already weakened the grid. Despite the disruptions, Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that the Palais des Festivals switched to an independent power supply, ensuring all scheduled events, including the Closing Ceremony, proceeded as planned.

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver the commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, amid changes to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Recent actions, including the disbanding of student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and the removal of books on diversity from academy libraries, reflect the administration's rollback of DEI initiatives. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these changes undermine the values and education of the academies. Two protests are planned during the ceremony.</p>

          <p>A tax bill passed by the House of Representatives could jeopardize the U.S. clean energy boom by terminating key tax credits that have supported the industry's growth. The legislation would effectively undo President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, potentially leading to job losses and increased electricity costs. Companies have invested over $161 billion in solar and battery storage projects since the IRA passed, but the tax bill could significantly slow down the deployment of clean energy to the grid.

The GOP's drive to pass Trump's agenda fits a pattern of using alleged Democratic transgressions as justification to go even further.

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decline, reversing the spike that occurred during the pandemic. Murder rates have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, with early data for 2025 suggesting the potential for the lowest murder rate in US history. The decrease is attributed to the waning pandemic, government actions to stem violence, and community violence interruption programs. Despite the positive trends, many Americans still believe crime is rising, highlighting a "bad news bias" in perceptions of crime.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest as he reportedly charges $1 million for club memberships. He held a private dinner at his Golf club in Northern Virginia for 220 crypto investors who bought into his meme coin, with guests spending more than $394 million on the cryptocurrency. Ethics experts and Democrats are raising concerns about the implications of these financial dealings, while the White House claims there is no conflict of interest.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, could benefit investors but also carries risks for the housing market. Critics, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and raise housing prices. The Trump administration previously proposed ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie during his first term, but a decision is yet to be made.</p>
