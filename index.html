          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie stated that justice cannot be avoided to prevent embarrassment for powerful individuals implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein case. He and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna are leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing the files through a discharge petition. Khanna expressed confidence they will have the necessary 218 signatures by the end of September to bring the legislation to the House floor. This legislative push aims to ensure accountability for anyone involved, regardless of their status or influence.</p>

In an interview, Zelenskyy stated that Putin achieved his goal of meeting with a U.S. president, enhancing his international image without making any concessions. Amid ongoing Russian attacks, including a recent record assault on Kyiv, Zelenskyy reiterated his call for increased pressure and sanctions from the U.S. and European allies to compel Russia to end the war, emphasizing that energy is Russia's weapon.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to create online resources documenting Catholic miracles, spreading his faith through digital media. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV, recognized Acutis for his devout faith and kindness, which included defending bullied children and aiding the homeless. His preserved body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, has become a major pilgrimage site in Assisi.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris, who had been running in second place for most of the race, fell behind his teammate Oscar Piastri after a slow pit stop. McLaren then ordered Piastri, the championship leader, to let Norris pass, a decision that Piastri publicly disagreed with but ultimately followed. The team defended the move, comparing it to a previous tactical swap, but it has sparked debate about fairness in the tight title race.</p>

          <h2>Knee Pain Increasingly Affects Younger Adults Due to Obesity and High-Intensity Sports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 11:00:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of adults in their 30s and 40s are experiencing knee pain, a problem traditionally associated with aging. Medical experts attribute this trend to two primary factors: a higher average body mass index (BMI) and a rise in injuries from high-intensity sports during high school and college. A recent study found that early structural damage in the knees is common by age 30, often without symptoms, with higher BMI being the main contributing factor.

Her diet prioritizes green leafy vegetables like kale, dairy, eggs, and animal meat, while strictly avoiding sugar and simple carbohydrates, which she says cause inflammation and mental "dullness."

Previous attempts to identify the driver failed because he always wore a helmet, preventing police from taking action. The vehicle is believed to be a Dallara GP2 racing car, and the owner now faces fines for driving it on public roads.</p>

However, one analysis suggests that widespread panic is misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The article argues that while prices on some goods will rise, the larger threat to the economy is the potential end of the long boom in the labor market. As long as income and wealth continue to grow, the economy will likely absorb the impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

These performances have stoked hope for the team's future ahead of the next World Cup in four years.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," is one of the most important things parents can do for their newborn's development. Consistent, deep sleep is crucial for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional growth and is linked to better cognitive function and emotional regulation later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and maintaining a flexible routine. He emphasizes that these foundational habits are easiest to instill in infancy and contribute to long-term well-being.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that individuals preparing for societal collapse, often associated with right-wing politics, should embrace solar energy. Despite political affiliations with fossil fuels, solar power offers unparalleled self-sufficiency and resilience, aligning with conservative ideals of individualism and independence. Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on complex supply chains, solar panels provide a durable, long-term energy source with simple maintenance, requiring only sunlight. The author suggests that this practical advantage should transcend political divides, making solar panels a logical choice for anyone concerned with personal preparedness in a crisis.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in the Arizona State Senate have filed an ethics complaint seeking to expel Democratic Senator Analise Ortiz. The complaint stems from Ortiz resharing an Instagram post from a community group that warned of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity near an elementary school. Republicans claim her action was reckless and jeopardized officer safety, while Ortiz defends it as exercising her First Amendment right to inform her community. Ortiz and her supporters, including the state's Democratic attorney general, have condemned the move as a politically motivated attempt at intimidation.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's rhetoric highlights his increasing use of the phrase "never seen anything like it" and similar superlatives. This verbal tic is presented not just as a signature style but as a reflection of his black-and-white worldview and approach to governance. By framing events as historically unprecedented, whether as immense successes or dire crises, he creates a context that justifies extreme responses and consolidates his position as a heroic figure. This form of "truthful hyperbole" is a consistent feature of his communication, often used regardless of factual accuracy.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The demonstrations, among the largest in recent months, featured emotional appeals from the families of the hostages, who argue that intensifying the military offensive further endangers their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure for a ceasefire, the Israeli government has vowed to continue its campaign until it achieves total victory and gains full control of the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece posits that China's simultaneous expansion of both coal and renewable energy is a pragmatic strategy, not a climate policy reversal. As the country adds record amounts of solar and wind power, existing grid infrastructure struggles to handle the intermittent supply, leading to increased "curtailment" where clean energy is wasted. New coal plants are being used as a flexible backup or "shock absorber" to ensure grid stability, especially during peak demand and when hydropower is low. This approach allows grid operators to confidently approve more renewables without risking blackouts during the transition.</p>

The platform grew organically through word of mouth and expanded internationally, becoming a major player in the second-hand fashion market. Despite early struggles, Vinted became Lithuania's first tech "unicorn" and now has over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>
