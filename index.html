          <p>A UK High Court has granted a temporary injunction to Epping Forest District Council, preventing the government from housing asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel. The ruling, which requires all asylum seekers to be moved by September 12, came after the council argued that recent protests were escalating community tensions.

While acknowledging a "deferral mindset" among homeowners due to economic uncertainty, executives noted positive signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter.

          <p>Kentucky has issued an emergency ban on bromazolam, an unregulated synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax," following its connection to nearly 50 overdose deaths in the state last year. Governor Andy Beshear's action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, enabling law enforcement to pursue charges for its sale or possession. The move is part of a wider effort by 21 state attorneys general urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to implement a federal ban on the dangerous drug.</p>

          <p>Shares of Viking Therapeutics experienced a sharp decline of over 40% after the company released disappointing mid-stage trial data for its oral obesity drug. Investors were concerned by the results, which showed a high discontinuation rate of around 28% among participants, largely due to gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and vomiting. The data is seen as inferior to competing oral treatments from industry leaders Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, diminishing hopes for the company to become a major competitor in the lucrative weight-loss drug market.

          <p>Financial experts are cautioning consumers that buy now, pay later (BNPL) services can lead to unsustainable spending habits and significant debt. While these plans offer the convenience of interest-free installments, they can encourage overspending by making purchases feel cheaper and masking the total cost. Experts point out that using multiple BNPL services simultaneously can create a complex web of payments, and missed payments can lead to fees and potential damage to one's credit score, turning a seemingly smart budgeting tool into a financial pitfall.</p>

          <p>Newly released police investigation documents show that Bryan Kohberger, who murdered four University of Idaho students, was known for sexist and unsettling behavior while in his graduate program at Washington State University. Fellow students and faculty members described him as creepy and condescending toward women, with one professor expressing concern he might stalk or abuse students in the future. The records detail multiple complaints about his conduct and note that he physically blocked female students in their office, reinforcing a pattern of problematic behavior before the murders.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals that a declining number of young adults aged 25 to 34 are achieving traditional milestones of adulthood compared to previous generations. The study found that in 2023, less than a quarter of young adults had met four key markers—moving out, getting a job, marrying, and having a child—down from nearly half in 1975. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, such as the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward marriage and family formation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly accused India of profiteering by purchasing discounted Russian crude oil and reselling the refined products, such as gasoline, to global markets. Bessent labeled this practice the "Indian arbitrage" and called it unacceptable, stating that some of India's wealthiest families have made billions in excess profits from the trade. This accusation comes as the Trump administration increases tariffs on Indian exports to pressure New Delhi over its economic ties with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Republican party is intensifying efforts to ensure favorable election outcomes through structural means rather than voter persuasion. It points to the push for mid-decade redistricting in Texas at President Trump's behest and a Supreme Court case challenging the last vestiges of the Voting Rights Act. The author contends these actions reflect a broader strategy to predetermine election results by controlling who can vote and whose votes count, signaling a weakening commitment to competitive democratic processes.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes the diplomatic strategies European leaders and Vladimir Putin employ when dealing with President Trump. The author argues that while European leaders act like "supplicants," offering praise and concessions to win favor, Putin treats Trump as a "protege," appealing to his authoritarian instincts and vision of a world run by powerful strongmen. This dynamic creates an imbalance where Russia can effectively bend Trump's ear with disinformation, undermining the efforts of America's traditional allies to maintain a united front on issues like Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has issued a mixed ruling in a civil rights lawsuit concerning the remote "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. The judge dismissed claims regarding detainees' lack of confidential access to lawyers, ruling them moot after the administration designated a different facility for their hearings. However, the judge also transferred the remaining claims of First Amendment violations to a different jurisdiction, allowing that part of the case to proceed while highlighting the complex legal landscape for the detainees.</p>

The attack, which killed six people including a child, was allegedly motivated by the suspect's frustration over a civil lawsuit and was planned weeks in advance. Authorities have described the suspect as an anti-Islam activist, and the incident prompted a surge in far-right activity in the region following the tragedy.</p>

          <p>This article investigates how families of inmates who died or suffered from negligent care are navigating the complex bankruptcy proceedings of private equity-backed prison healthcare companies like Corizon (now YesCare) and Wellpath. These companies have filed for bankruptcy in part due to numerous lawsuits alleging substandard care, a move that automatically pauses all legal claims against them. Despite the legal hurdles, victims' families have organized and, in some cases, gained roles on creditor committees, securing larger settlements and even equity in the reorganized companies.</p>
