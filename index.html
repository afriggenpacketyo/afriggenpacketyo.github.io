          <p>China is strengthening its relationship with eSwatini, one of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies, through significant infrastructure projects. A Chinese state-owned enterprise is building the US$146 million Mpakeni Dam, a key part of a larger water project funded by the African Development Bank. This move signals Beijing's increasing economic influence in the region, even with nations that formally recognize Taiwan, highlighting a strategy of leveraging economic partnerships to advance its geopolitical interests.</p>

          <p>Amid a chikungunya fever outbreak in southern China, health experts are cautioning that broad mosquito elimination efforts may be ineffective. The viral disease, spread by Aedes mosquitoes, has prompted authorities in cities like Foshan to penalize businesses for not clearing breeding sites. However, specialists argue that these measures often miss the specific mosquito species responsible for transmission, such as Aedes aegypti, which is rare in the region, suggesting a more targeted approach is needed.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, a New South Wales state lawmaker convicted of sexual assault, resigned from parliament just before his colleagues were scheduled to vote on his expulsion. Ward, who was convicted in July for sexually assaulting a political staffer and an 18-year-old, had initially refused to step down from jail while awaiting sentencing. His resignation followed a failed legal attempt to block the expulsion vote, a rare measure in Australian politics, ending a contentious period for the state parliament.</p>

          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group, has been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for conspiring to attack the power grid in Baltimore, Maryland.

          <p>His Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) is facing accusations of a cover-up over a persistent IT bug that caused legal evidence to be lost, overwritten, or hidden in its case management software. A leaked report reveals that HMCTS management knew about the issue for years but failed to conduct a comprehensive investigation or inform judges, fearing reputational damage. Sources worry that rulings in thousands of cases may have been made based on incomplete information, potentially leading to miscarriages of justice.</p>

          <p>Iconic French brand Perrier is at the center of a scandal that could strip it of its "natural mineral water" designation, following revelations of illicit water treatment practices. Investigations found that at least a third of French mineral water brands used illegal filtration methods due to contamination concerns, a practice that violates EU law for "natural" water. The controversy, dubbed France's "Water-gate," involves allegations of corporate fraud and government collusion, raising questions about product purity.</p>
