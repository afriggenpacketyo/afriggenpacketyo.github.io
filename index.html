          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is facing severe disruptions due to an equipment failure at an air traffic control center and ongoing staffing shortages, exacerbated by runway construction and bad weather. Air traffic controllers temporarily lost communication with planes on April 28, leading to numerous delays, cancellations, and flight diversions. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation into the issues, blaming mismanagement at the FAA and past cuts.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is "on the eve of a forceful entry to Gaza" after his security cabinet approved a new plan for military escalation, including relocating Palestinians to the south. This announcement comes after more than two months of continued blockade and bombardment of Gaza, with cease-fire talks at a standstill. Critics argue the expanded military campaign endangers hostages and won't fundamentally change the conflict's dynamic. The article notes that the call-up of soldiers is seen as a message to Netanyahu’s hard-line supporters, some of whom were dismayed that the military had not completed the task of eradicating Hamas.</p>
