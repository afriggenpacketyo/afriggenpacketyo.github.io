          <p>Elias Rodriguez of Chicago has been charged with first-degree murder and other counts in connection with the shooting deaths of two Israeli Embassy staff members outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were a young couple and employees at the Israeli Embassy who were about to be engaged. Authorities are investigating the shooting as a hate crime and terrorism, with potential for additional charges. The suspect allegedly shouted "I did it for Gaza" and "Free Palestine" after the shooting, while security has been increased around faith-based organizations and schools in the community.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-4 decision, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling, blocking the state from using government money to run the nation's first religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, resulting in the tie. The proposed school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, aimed to incorporate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. The deadlock sets no nationwide precedent, leaving the question of whether states can sponsor religious charter schools unresolved, and legal experts anticipate the issue will return to the court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining currently enrolled foreign students, citing an unsafe campus environment due to anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, accusing the university of refusing to provide information about purported misconduct of foreign students. Harvard has denounced the action as unlawful and retaliatory.

          <p>In this New York Times article, David Brooks challenges the populist narrative that America's economic woes stem from neoliberal globalization policies implemented in the 1990s and early 2000s. Brooks argues that this narrative is historically inaccurate, pointing out that top marginal tax rates were higher in 2016 than in 1992, and federal spending on social programs increased. He contends that the decline in manufacturing jobs primarily resulted from increased productivity, not globalization, and that the so-called era of neoliberal globalism has actually produced significant economic growth in America.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. The study compared GLP-1s to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitors, another type of diabetes medication without the same weight loss effect. Researchers found that patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause, particularly among women.</p>

          <p>The UK government has signed an agreement to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, citing legal and practical reasons. The move aims to safeguard the UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, fearing potential legal challenges and Chinese influence if sovereignty wasn't ceded. The deal allows the UK to effectively veto any foreign military presence on the islands. It also addresses long-standing accusations of hypocrisy regarding international law and aims to strengthen diplomatic relations amidst geopolitical uncertainty.</p>

It notes the relevance of this principle today, as the Trump administration cancels visas of foreign students for viewpoints it deems “bad” and as institutions of higher education investigate and discipline members of their communities for expressing views that run afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies.</p>

          <h2>Echoes of Past Violence: D.C. Shooting Brings Back Memories of Unsolved Israeli Diplomat Killing</h2>

          <p>The recent shooting of two Israeli Embassy staff members in Washington, D.C., has brought back memories of the unsolved 1973 killing of Israeli military attaché Col. Yosef Alon. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, shouted "Free, free Palestine" after being apprehended. While the recent shooting led to a quick arrest, the unsolved Alon case highlights a history of violence tied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, both in the Middle East and on American soil, and has prompted a renewed focus on the normalization of violence against Jewish people.</p>
