          <p>The WNBA's expansion franchise in Portland has reportedly fired its team president, Inky Son, just two months after her hiring. This move comes amid reports of a "rocky" rollout and "growing pains" for the new team, which is expected to announce its official name and branding in mid-July. Son was the first employee hired by the franchise, and her responsibilities included overseeing all business operations for the team. The dismissal raises questions about the stability of the new organization as it prepares for its inaugural season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision limiting nationwide injunctions, the practical implementation of President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship remains unclear. While the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality, the administration can now begin drafting regulations, which could go into effect in as little as 30 days in states that have not filed legal challenges. Advocacy groups are preparing for further litigation, including a new class-action lawsuit, to fight the policy on its merits. The White House has not yet provided specific details on how the order would be enforced.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran. The measure failed despite growing Democratic frustration over a lack of information regarding recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Some Democrats have questioned the administration's claims about the extent of the damage to Iran's program, suggesting the White House may be misleading the public.

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is occurring faster than sea levels are rising, potentially degrading the city's defenses against storm surges. Researchers identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new residential developments, linking the issue to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a critical warning about the need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city from future flood risks.</p>

Guterres emphasized that searching for food should not be a death sentence and called for a political solution.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled to limit the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 decision, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that such broad orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts by Congress. While the ruling arose from challenges to President Trump's birthright citizenship order, the court did not decide on the policy's constitutionality. The decision narrows the scope of judicial power, a move praised by the Trump administration but criticized by dissenters as weakening checks on executive power.</p>

Organizers, such as the El Sereno Bicentennial Committee, made the decision after many local groups withdrew from participating due to widespread fear in the community. The cancellations reflect the tangible impact of the raids on daily life, as residents have become increasingly anxious about being in public spaces.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would create a bureaucratic labyrinth and lead to massive coverage losses. He also stated the legislation threatens funding for struggling rural hospitals and could increase premiums for those on the state's insurance marketplace. The governor described the proposed cuts as reckless and cruel, potentially reversing California's progress in reducing its uninsured rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed, was assessed in a survey of nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers suggest that specific nutrients in these foods, such as omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may contribute to improved mental well-being by aiding the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin.

          <p>Researchers are reviving a century-old medical concept known as phage therapy to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The therapy uses bacteriophages, which are viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, as an alternative to traditional antibiotics. This article follows a journalist's journey to collect a phage sample from his own home, which successfully killed a patient's drug-resistant infection in a lab setting. As antibiotic effectiveness wanes, scientists at institutions like the University of Southampton are working to develop phages into a viable treatment, offering hope for a future where common infections could once again become deadly.</p>

Having already paid over $162,000 in tariffs, he found it impossible to absorb the rising costs while maintaining competitive prices.

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders targeting an elite law firm, ruling that the action against Susman Godfrey was unconstitutional. The order was part of a series of punitive measures the president has taken against firms for representing clients he opposes or employing attorneys he dislikes. In each of the four cases brought by different law firms, judges have found the orders to be an unconstitutional attack on the firms' rights and the independence of the legal system. The ruling is another significant legal rebuke to the administration's campaign against the legal profession.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a major U-turn on planned cuts to disability benefits, avoiding a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs but raising serious questions about its policy-making process. The initial plan aimed to generate quick savings to meet self-imposed fiscal rules, but critics argued it was a short-sighted cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine long-term welfare reform. This reversal may force the Chancellor to find Â£3 billion through other means, such as tax increases or different spending cuts. The episode highlights the tension between achieving short-term fiscal targets and implementing credible, structural reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

The bold presentation was largely praised online as a revolutionary use of fashion to bring awareness to social injustice, though some found it distasteful.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Celebrates Supreme Court Ruling on Nationwide Injunctions as a 'Monumental Win'</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that limited the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive orders. In a rare appearance in the White House briefing room, he called the ruling a "monumental victory for the Constitution." The case stemmed from his order to end birthright citizenship, and while the court did not rule on the policy's legality, it curbed a key tool used by judges to block his agenda. The decision was praised by the administration but drew sharp criticism from Democrats, who warned it weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for several days to study atmospheric data. The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will fly between 1,000 and 10,000 feet over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The flights are part of NASA's Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) and will involve performing vertical spirals and what look like missed landings to sample atmospheric gasses and measure land and water surfaces. NASA is advising the public not to be alarmed by the peculiar flight patterns.</p>
