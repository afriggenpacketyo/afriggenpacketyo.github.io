          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns. The administration claims these countries lack sufficient vetting processes to detect potential safety or terrorism threats. The policy, which mirrors a similar 2017 travel ban, exempts U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with clear evidence of identity and relationship. The ban is set to take effect on June 9, impacting foreigners outside the U.S. who lack visas. </p>

          <p>The Education Department has stated that Columbia University is in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws and is therefore not meeting accreditation standards. The department's civil rights office has notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, accusing the university of failing to adequately address anti-Semitism on campus following the October 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. The department said that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students on its campus. Losing accreditation would mean that Columbia would be ineligible to offer federal financial aid to students attending the university.</p>

          <p>Three young sisters have been found dead in Washington state, and their father, Travis Decker, is wanted for murder and kidnapping. The girls were reported missing after their father failed to return them following a visit. Decker's unoccupied truck was located near a campground, where officers discovered the bodies of the three girls. Police believe the girls died from asphyxiation, and their wrists were zip-tied; Decker is described as having extensive training and is considered well-versed in outdoor survival.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels, making it the agency's largest operation of its kind. The state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment. The Squaxin Island Tribe supports the cleanup, as maintaining clean beaches and water are essential to their culture.</p>
