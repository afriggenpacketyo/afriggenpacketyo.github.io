          <p>Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, the current North American chief operating officer, as its new CEO, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa's appointment comes after Tavares' unexpected resignation due to profit decline and sales issues in the U.S. Filosa, a 25-year company veteran, previously served as Jeep brand CEO and chief quality officer. The company recently reported a 14% downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainties related to U.S. trade policy. </p>

The investigation uncovered serious failures in the company's management of wastewater, leading to environmental damage and regulatory breaches.

          <p>Concerns are rising in Japan's bond market as long-dated yields hover near record highs, potentially sparking capital flight from the U.S. and an unwinding of carry trades. Analysts suggest that rising Japanese government bond yields could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., impacting U.S. tech stocks due to a stronger yen. Some strategists warn of a possible "global financial market Armageddon" if yields continue to climb, increasing borrowing costs and tightening global liquidity. However, other analysts believe the carry trade impact might be gradual due to reduced confidence in the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia is implementing a new drone tactic in Ukraine, involving dive-bombing with Iranian-designed Shaheds from high altitudes to avoid small arms fire. Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat stated that the drones are diving from about 2 kilometers in the sky, making them harder to target with heavy machine guns. This adaptation addresses Ukraine's strategy of shooting down Shaheds using mobile fire groups. However, the high-altitude maneuvers make the drones more easily detectable by radar, requiring Ukraine to rely more on surface-to-air missiles. Russia's strategy aims to exhaust Ukraine's air defenses, often combining drone attacks with long-range missile strikes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered embassies to cease scheduling appointments for student visas in preparation for expanded social media vetting of applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the pause would last "until further guidance is issued". The message said social media vetting would be stepped up for student and foreign exchange visas, which would have "significant implications" for embassies and consulates. The move comes amid Trump's feud with some of America's most elite colleges, which he believes are too left-wing and have enabled antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of murder and sexual assault, escaped from an Arkansas prison by impersonating a corrections officer. Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was serving lengthy sentences for his crimes. Authorities are searching the rugged Ozark Mountains for Hardin, while the sister of one of his victims expressed alarm, as she and other relatives were witnesses in his court proceedings. The escape occurred days after 10 men fled a New Orleans jail, heightening concerns about prison security.</p>

          <p>The UN's weather agency reports that there is a 70% chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 will exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius benchmark. This comes after the planet experienced the two hottest years ever recorded in 2023 and 2024. The 1.5-degree target was set as part of the 2015 Paris climate accords, which aimed to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels. Climate researchers predict that the probability of passing 1.5 degrees Celcius on a long-term basis will reach 100% in the late 2020s or early 2030s.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan concludes that possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalized. The London Drugs Commission, chaired by Lord Falconer, makes 42 recommendations, including removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalisation. The report also recommends improved public health services for cannabis-related harm, enhanced cannabis education, and support for fair access to medical cannabis.</p>

          <p>Vodafone's recent full-year results have sparked dÃ©jÃ  vu among long-term followers, with CEO Margherita Della Valle asserting that the company is at an "inflexion point." Similar claims have been made by previous CEOs, highlighting the company's history of disappointing investors. Vodafone's fortunes mirror those of corporate Britain, with the company expanding overseas in the late 1990s before a period of retrenchment and write-downs. While Vodafone has made some strategic moves, such as exiting Italy and merging with Three UK, it remains a deeply frustrating company with ongoing challenges.</p>
