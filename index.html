          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a public warning, advising citizens traveling abroad to be cautious of souvenirs that may contain hidden surveillance equipment. The agency stated that items like key rings, necklaces, or backpack charms could be modified with cameras, listening devices, or trackers by foreign spy agencies. According to the ministry, state sector employees, scholars, and students are considered prime targets for these compromised gifts. The warning emphasizes that bringing such items into classified workplaces could lead to the leakage of state secrets, and it reminds the public of China's strict counter-espionage laws.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's new Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has indicated she will likely seek a new loan from the International Monetary Fund to address the country's significant fiscal needs during the war with Russia. With global donors having only committed half of the estimated $75 billion required over the next two years, these discussions are crucial. Meanwhile, international partners are working to supply more military aid, including Patriot missile defense systems from Germany. In a separate development, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that another round of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia is scheduled to be held in Istanbul.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Surges, Increasing Pressure for Autumn Tax Hikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 03:53:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a significant increase of £6.6 billion compared to the same month last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. This rise is attributed to higher public service spending and soaring debt interest payments, which nearly doubled due to inflation. The figure, the second-highest for June on record, intensifies pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to stabilize public finances. Analysts now suggest that tax increases or further spending cuts in the upcoming autumn Budget are becoming increasingly probable to meet fiscal targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annie Farmer, a key witness and one of Jeffrey Epstein's earliest accusers, is urging the U.S. government to release all information related to his case, stating that if there is "nothing to hide," the files should be made public. She expressed exhaustion over the politicization of the case and the lack of new information, leaving victims feeling used. Farmer remains skeptical of the Trump administration's handling of the files, citing shifting promises and the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey. She was motivated to speak out following the suicide of fellow accuser Virginia Giuffre and calls to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

Separately, Germany is grappling with a cyber espionage operation that has compromised numerous organizations using Microsoft's SharePoint software.

          <p>The projected cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in the UK has escalated to £38 billion, a substantial increase from the previous £20 billion estimate. Project officials clarified that earlier figures did not account for inflation or risk, and confirmed the new cost will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills during construction. The government has secured its 44.9% stake and investment from partners like Centrica and EDF. Critics argue that the public will bear the burden of inevitable cost overruns, while the government maintains the project is vital for clean, homegrown energy.</p>

A party source stated the changes reflect the next stage of policy renewal and aim to present a united front against the Labour government. The reshuffle is seen by some as a reaction to poor local election results and ongoing pressure to improve the party's standing.</p>

Russia has historically removed depictions of homosexuality from films like "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "Rocketman." China is particularly known for its strict censorship, altering plots, removing scenes critical of the state, and even creating entirely new endings for films like "Minions: The Rise of Gru" to promote state-approved values and secure market access.</p>

With an estimated investment of 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion), the project's capacity is expected to be three times that of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement led to a significant surge in the stock prices of related Chinese companies, with shares of state-owned developer Power Construction Corporation of China jumping by the 10% daily limit. Firms specializing in hydro equipment and cement also saw substantial gains. (not investment advice)</p>

Marcos has expressed readiness to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement to secure a mutually beneficial partnership. The meeting underscores the strategic importance of the U.S.-Philippines alliance, with both leaders expected to reaffirm their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The automotive industry is renewing its push to develop and commercialize solid-state batteries, often hailed as the future of electric vehicles. Major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota, along with battery producers CATL and BYD, are targeting commercial production before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical bridge technology, the high cost and technical challenges remain significant hurdles, especially as existing battery technologies continue to see rapid improvements.

Scott left the game in the ninth inning with a forearm injury after feeling a stinging sensation in his throwing arm and will undergo an MRI. The game featured a strong performance from Shohei Ohtani, who pitched three solid innings and hit a two-run home run, while catcher Will Smith added two solo homers. Despite the offensive success, the team is now anxiously awaiting the results of Scott's scan, a major concern for their already injury-plagued pitching staff.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has threatened former President Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment for potentially violating a social media ban. The warning came after Bolsonaro's allies circulated a video of a speech he gave to journalists, which the judge believes was an intentional circumvention of the ban. Justice Alexandre de Moraes had previously ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and banned him from social media and from approaching foreign governments over allegations of planning a coup.

          <p>This article explores the Trump administration's increasing reliance on tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, often blurring the line with traditional sanctions. Unlike sanctions, which typically require international cooperation and complex legal frameworks, tariffs can be imposed unilaterally by the president to exert rapid economic pressure. This approach aligns with Trump's "America First" agenda and has been used to address trade deficits and influence non-trade issues like immigration. While this strategy offers flexibility and generates revenue, critics warn that the resulting uncertainty could destabilize global trade and lead to a serious economic slowdown.

          <p>San Francisco supervisors are poised to approve a new policy that effectively bans homeless people from living in recreational vehicles by imposing a strict two-hour parking limit citywide. The measure targets at least 400 RVs that serve as homes for people who cannot afford rent. Mayor Daniel Lurie supports the policy as necessary to clear sidewalks and reduce trash, while critics call it cruel, arguing it displaces people without providing sufficient housing alternatives. A permit program will exempt some current RV residents, provided they work with the city to find housing and eventually give up their vehicles.</p>

Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the goal is to restore trust for the thousands infected with HIV and hepatitis in the 1970s-90s. A key change ensures that if a family member with a claim dies, their payment can be passed on through their estate. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they expressed disappointment that some issues, such as compensation levels for hepatitis victims, remain subject to further consultation.</p>
