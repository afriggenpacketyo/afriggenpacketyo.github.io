        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portuguese forward João Félix, once the third most expensive transfer in football history, is set to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr. This move at age 25 is widely seen as a step back from top-level European competition, following underwhelming stints at Atlético Madrid, Chelsea, and Barcelona. Despite his immense early potential at Benfica, where he won the Golden Boy award, Félix has struggled to consistently perform under various high-profile managers. Pundits suggest a combination of mentality and an unwillingness to adapt to modern football's defensive demands has hindered him from fulfilling his initial promise.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more Americans face financial distress, personal bankruptcy filings are on the rise, but the process carries significant risks that require careful consideration. A primary consequence is a severe and long-lasting negative impact on one's credit score, which can make obtaining future loans or credit extremely difficult for up to a decade. Furthermore, filers risk losing valuable non-exempt assets, such as a second car or investment properties, which can be liquidated by a trustee to repay creditors. The decision can also have professional and personal repercussions, potentially affecting employment opportunities or rental applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Chelan County, Washington, are scaling back the search for Travis Decker, who is accused of murdering his three young daughters in early June. The decision comes after nearly two months of exhaustive searching yielded inconclusive evidence and a decrease in new leads regarding his whereabouts. Officials stated there is insufficient information to determine if Decker is alive or deceased, though the criminal investigation remains active. The U.S. Marshals Service continues to offer a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Decker, who is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's lawyers have filed a motion requesting that media mogul Rupert Murdoch be deposed within 15 days for a $10 billion defamation lawsuit. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. The legal team cites Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health issues as primary reasons for the urgency, arguing he may be unavailable to testify if the case proceeds at a normal pace. The motion also seeks access to Murdoch's communications and documents related to the publication of the article in question.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide, delivering a significant legal victory for the organization. The ruling blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to defund affiliates providing abortions by cutting off their Medicaid payments for one year. Judge Indira Talwani's order noted that restricting these funds would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that without this funding, nearly 200 of its clinics would be at risk of closure.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently seen a slight decrease, presenting a more affordable borrowing opportunity for homeowners. With the average HELOC rate now at 8.26% and home equity loan rates at 8.25%, experts advise homeowners to act strategically. Homeowners should carefully compare the two products to see which fits their needs, check with their current mortgage lender for offers before shopping around, and precisely determine the amount of equity they need to borrow. This cautious approach is recommended since the home serves as collateral for these types of loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The festival, organized by GigPig, will involve over 1,000 venues across the UK and aims to highlight their cultural importance amid unprecedented economic challenges facing the hospitality sector.

          <p>A group of 20 states and Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture to block an unprecedented demand for the personal data of millions of food stamp recipients.

The lawsuit, led by California and New York, argues this data collection violates federal privacy laws and the Constitution.

Other products likely to see price increases include beer, wine, and spirits from Europe, as well as essential building materials like lumber from Canada.

          <p>For individuals cutting back on red meat due to health concerns like increased risks of diabetes and cancer, nutrition experts recommend several alternative sources of iron. Plant-based options rich in this vital mineral include lentils, beans, tofu, pumpkin seeds, and spinach. To enhance the body's absorption of this plant-based iron, it is best to pair these foods with sources of vitamin C. Additionally, certain types of seafood such as oysters, clams, and sardines are excellent sources of iron. Fortified breads and cereals also contribute significantly to daily iron intake in the U.S.</p>

          <p>During Disability Pride Month, Berkeley activist and artist Maya Morya Selkie Scott is highlighting her "Disability Justice Community Stories Quilt Project." The project invites people to design their own quilt panels, creating a collective tapestry that shares diverse stories of life with a disability. Scott, a wheelchair user, sees the quilt as a way to make the disabled community more visible and to honor the history of disability rights activism, drawing inspiration from the AIDS Memorial Quilt. The growing quilt serves as a traveling artifact for education and advocacy, weaving together personal narratives of struggle, joy, and justice.</p>

          <p>Despite recent downgrades from Mizuho and Guggenheim, CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed continued confidence in GE Vernova, advising his Investing Club members not to worry. Both financial firms cited the stock's high valuation after a significant rally as the reason for their neutral ratings, though Mizuho raised its price target. Cramer noted the company's strong order book and suggested its CEO should be expanding production capacity to meet demand. The analysis reflects a long-term positive outlook on the company, contrasting with the more cautious short-term views from the investment banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that his administration will likely implement a global baseline tariff of 15% to 20% on all imports from countries without a negotiated trade agreement. This new range is an increase from the 10% baseline tariff he announced in April. Speaking in Scotland, Trump explained that the tariff would apply to the rest of the world because it is not feasible to make hundreds of individual deals. The announcement comes just days before an August 1 deadline and could significantly impact smaller nations that were hoping for a lower rate.</p>

Experts suggest Biya is adept at neutralizing potential rivals by playing them against each other and that the military's structure prevents any single group from staging a coup. While the country suffers from poverty and corruption, the fragmented opposition has been unable to form a united front, allowing Biya's ruling party to remain dominant.</p>
