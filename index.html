          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Israeli-Run Food Distribution in Gaza Serves as an Alibi for Starvation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 05:00:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, Alex de Waal argues that the Israeli-backed food distribution system in Gaza is a facade that fails to address the deepening famine. He contends the four distribution sites are insufficient, dangerously located in military zones, and inaccessible to the most vulnerable, such as mothers with children and the elderly. The article asserts that this system perpetuates a 'law of the jungle' rather than providing genuine humanitarian relief, ultimately serving as an alibi to mask the crime of mass starvation and the destruction of Palestinian society.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Cuban asylum seeker, identified as Jenny, was apprehended by masked ICE agents inside a Texas immigration courthouse moments after a judge granted her a future hearing date. Having entered the U.S. legally, she was attending a required hearing when agents detained her, reflecting a wider trend of arrests at courthouses under the current administration. This tactic targets migrants for expedited removal, often separating them from legal counsel and family support, creating a climate of fear even for those following legal procedures.</p>

          <p>Snoop Dogg has collaborated with the Zac Brown Band on a new country-rap song titled "Let It Run," which he describes as a blend of their distinct styles. In a recent interview, the rapper explained that the collaboration was a natural fit and emphasized the growing trend of cross-genre music that brings different audiences together. This is not his first venture into country music, as the article notes his previous work with artists like Willie Nelson and his belief that country and hip-hop share common ground in their storytelling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradoxical situation where the median price for an existing home reached an all-time high in June, even as the overall volume of sales has slowed. This trend is largely driven by a segmented market where wealthy, all-cash buyers dominate high-end sales, propping up prices. Meanwhile, first-time and middle-income buyers are increasingly priced out due to persistently high mortgage rates, which also discourages current homeowners from selling and losing their lower-rate mortgages.

          <p>Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have stated that disarmament is a non-negotiable "red line" as they face a critical political juncture. This declaration comes as peace talks with Syria's interim government have stalled over the integration of Kurdish forces into the national army and control over key territories. The situation is further complicated by external pressures, with Turkey warning against Kurdish autonomy and seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could threaten the Kurds' semi-autonomous region.</p>

          <p>A tragic bus crash in the Junin region of Peru has killed at least 15 people and left approximately 30 others injured. The double-decker bus, which was traveling from Lima with over 60 passengers, veered off the road and plunged into a ravine, landing on its roof next to a river. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, which is the latest in a series of fatal bus crashes in the country, where excessive speed and poor road conditions are often contributing factors.</p>
