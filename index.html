          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has observed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appears more open to peace negotiations than in their previous encounters. Following a meeting at the United Nations, Lula is reviving a Brazil-China peace plan, emphasizing that both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin seem to understand the limits of the ongoing conflict. He stressed the importance of the UN leading the negotiations to restore its authority and effectively represent all member states. This diplomatic effort aligns with a rare joint endorsement by China and Brazil of a US-led ceasefire initiative earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region showed varied results, diverging from Wall Street's downward trend which was fueled by investors selling shares in major technology companies like Nvidia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index recorded gains, partly due to a successful IPO from Chinese automaker Chery, whose shares surged upon their debut. Conversely, markets in Taiwan and South Korea were more subdued, reflecting investor caution about the AI industry's growth and anticipation of U.S. labor market data that could influence the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions.

The couple was struck by a vehicle, reportedly a van with a vanity plate reading "TIMES SQUARE," which then fled the scene. Eyewitnesses described a chaotic situation in the busy area, stating that the driver sped away after the collision. The New York Police Department has launched an investigation into the tragic event, but as of Wednesday evening, no arrests had been made and the driver remained at large.</p>

The company raised approximately $1.2 billion in its IPO, signaling strong investor confidence despite canceling its listing ceremony due to a typhoon. Chery has been actively expanding its global presence, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, a strategy that analysts believe positions it well to mitigate risks from tariffs imposed by the U.S., Canada, and the EU.

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has indicated that a potential government shutdown on October 1 could be used as an opportunity to permanently eliminate some federal positions. In a memo to agency heads, the administration outlined a plan for a "reduction in force" targeting programs not aligned with presidential priorities, a significant departure from the temporary furloughs seen in past shutdowns. This move is seen as an aggressive tactic by budget director Russell Vought to cut government spending.

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Humberto in the central Atlantic, the eighth named storm of the season. The storm is currently moving northwestward and is expected to steadily strengthen over the next several days due to favorable environmental conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures. While there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, forecasters are monitoring its path for potential downstream impacts along the U.S. Southeast coast. A second weather system is also being tracked in the Caribbean, which could develop into a tropical depression later this week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has launched national security investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and a wide range of medical supplies, including masks, syringes, and pacemakers. Conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, these probes could result in new tariffs on these goods to encourage domestic production. This action expands upon previous tariffs on steel and aluminum and reflects growing concerns over reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from China and Mexico. The move could significantly increase costs for consumers and key industries, such as automotive manufacturing, that depend heavily on imported robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly close to a decision on whether to charge former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent target of President Trump's criticism. While the specific charges are unconfirmed, speculation centers on allegations that Comey may have lied to Congress in 2020, a charge for which the statute of limitations is about to expire. The situation is intensified by Trump's recent public calls for prosecution and his replacement of the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia with his former personal lawyer.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot require states to cooperate with federal immigration agents as a condition for receiving certain grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The ruling sides with 20 states that argued the policy unconstitutionally held critical emergency preparedness funding hostage to the administration's immigration agenda. The judge deemed the policy "arbitrary and capricious," providing a legal victory for so-called "sanctuary" states that limit local law enforcement's cooperation with ICE. The decision marks a setback in the administration's broader effort to withhold federal funds from jurisdictions with such policies.</p>

Instead of purchasing the chips outright, OpenAI will lease them, allowing the AI startup to spread its massive computing costs over time while Nvidia retains ownership. The initial $10 billion investment will be in cash, but most of it is expected to be directed back to Nvidia to pay for these leases. This financial structure helps OpenAI manage costs for its extensive data center expansion while raising some investor concerns about the circular flow of capital within the AI industry.

This growth is largely attributed to the falling costs of the technology and the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria.

          <p>In an interview ahead of his address to the United Nations, new Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa warned that Israel's recent military actions in the region risk damaging U.S. strategic interests. He specifically cited an Israeli airstrike near Syria's presidential palace as a "declaration of war" and suggested such aggressions could push American allies to seek alternative partnerships. Al-Sharaa, who came to power after ousting Bashar al-Assad, is seeking a security agreement with Israel to de-escalate tensions, which would involve a return to the 1974 ceasefire lines monitored by UN peacekeepers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump claimed he was the target of "triple sabotage" during his appearance at the United Nations after experiencing a series of technical glitches. In a social media post, he detailed how an escalator carrying him and the first lady stopped abruptly, his teleprompter failed, and the auditorium's sound system malfunctioned. Trump demanded an immediate investigation, dismissing the possibility of coincidence. A UN spokesperson later explained that the escalator's safety feature was likely triggered inadvertently by a videographer from the U.S. delegation who was moving backward up the stairs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The suspect in the deadly sniper attack at a Dallas ICE field office has been identified by law enforcement as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. Authorities report that Jahn, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, fired indiscriminately from a nearby rooftop, killing one detainee. An ideological motive is suspected, as shell casings found at the scene were engraved with anti-ICE messages. Childhood friends described Jahn as largely apolitical and primarily interested in video games and internet culture, expressing shock at his actions. His online activity on gaming websites indicates he was an avid gamer but had not been active recently.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications for skilled foreign workers is creating significant challenges for U.S. businesses, particularly startups and non-profits. While the fee currently applies only to future applicants, smaller companies in tech and healthcare state they cannot afford such costs, which could hinder their ability to hire essential talent. Proponents argue the fee targets large tech companies that can absorb the cost and may curb misuse of the program. However, critics and economists warn the policy could stifle innovation, lead to a "brain drain," and prompt companies to offshore jobs rather than hire domestically. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of scientists has successfully designed and tested a novel exhaust system that significantly reduces the intense heat inside nuclear fusion reactors, a major obstacle in developing fusion as a clean energy source. The "Super-X divertor," tested at a U.K. government facility, uses an extended plasma pathway to cool the superheated plasma before it can damage the reactor walls. This breakthrough in heat management is a critical step toward making fusion energy more practical and commercially viable. Nuclear fusion promises nearly limitless, low-carbon energy without the long-lasting radioactive waste associated with current nuclear fission technology.</p>

Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms. Ministers have reportedly ruled out a large-scale, COVID-style furlough scheme due to its high cost. (not investment advice)</p>
