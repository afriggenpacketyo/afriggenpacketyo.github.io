          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. would not lower tariffs on imports from China to facilitate trade talks, emphasizing that stopping fentanyl from entering America is a priority.

Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with China‚Äôs Vice-Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland for trade discussions.

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has called on the FAA to take immediate steps to alleviate ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, including limiting flights per hour during construction and returning the airport to a slot-controlled system. Kirby argues that the FAA's current management of Newark, including approving more flights per hour than the airport can handle, is unsustainable. The FAA is taking steps such as installing new communication lines and boosting controller staffing to address the issues. Until construction is complete in mid-June, travelers are advised to book early morning flights or consider alternative airports.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plans to deport immigrants to Libya are facing legal challenges, with experts citing violations of U.S. and international law due to Libya's record of human rights abuses. The administration intends to begin deportation flights to Libya, but the legal authority for these deportations is unclear, and both of Libya‚Äôs rival governments deny any agreement with the U.S. to accept deportees. Judge Brian Murphy ruled that the plan defies a court order requiring immigrants to be granted written notice of their deportation and a meaningful opportunity to appeal, while Becca Heller of the International Refugee Assistance Project raised concerns about the disappearances of individuals being sent to overseas black sites.</p>

The U.S. diplomatic mission in Pakistan issued a security alert, advising citizens to depart conflict areas or shelter in place, while President Trump offered to help both countries resolve the conflict. The strikes targeted infrastructure allegedly used by militants linked to a recent massacre of tourists in Kashmir, escalating tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive meeting, citing heightened uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. While acknowledging a solid labor market, policymakers noted increased risks of higher unemployment and inflation.

The Fed is struggling to assess the economic fallout from Trump‚Äôs policies and how to set monetary policy in an environment where its goals of maintaining a healthy labor market and keeping inflation low may conflict.</p>

          <p>An AI-generated version of a deceased Arizona man, Chris Pelkey, addressed his killer, Gabriel Horcasitas, during sentencing, delivering a victim's statement based on the man's forgiving nature. The family used voice recordings, videos, and pictures of Pelkey to recreate him in a video using AI. Judge Todd Lang praised the use of AI and sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges. While some experts are concerned about the precedent this case sets, others view it as a unique step into the future, with the family feeling that it gave their brother the final word.</p>
