          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students. This decision came hours after Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the ban, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) justified by alleging that Harvard tolerated "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" on campus. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard demonstrated it would suffer immediate and irreparable injury without the restraining order, allowing international students to remain enrolled pending a court hearing. The lawsuit calls the revocation a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," a legislative package containing President Trump's second-term agenda. Key provisions include extending the 2017 tax cuts, introducing new tax cuts for service industry workers and auto loan interest deductions, and eliminating taxes on gun silencers. The bill also introduces Medicaid restrictions, including work requirements for able-bodied adults, and increases the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) to $40,000 for households earning up to $500,000. Additionally, it allocates significant funding for border security, creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, and rolls back clean energy programs. </p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package that includes substantial cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The legislation aims to reduce Medicaid spending by approximately $700 billion and SNAP by about $300 billion over the next decade. These cuts, the largest in the programs' histories, are intended to offset tax perks included in the bill. The proposed changes include new work requirements and stricter eligibility checks, with some Republican leaders citing the need to eliminate waste, fraud, or abuse in the programs.</p>

          <p>Stocks tumbled after President Trump threatened new tariffs on Apple and the European Union, citing stalled trade discussions. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all experienced declines. Analysts suggest the tariff threats create uncertainty that is detrimental to global growth and markets. The president's posts on Truth Social indicated a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. and a 50% tariff on EU goods. The bond market showed increased concern over rising debt and unsustainable fiscal trajectories, diverging from the equity market's focus on potential business adaptation to tariffs. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs as investors grew concerned over President Trump's escalating trade war and the nation's rising debt. Trump's proposal of a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. prompted a flight to safety in bonds. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 4 basis points to 5.027%, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to 4.505%. These moves followed Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, citing the growing budget deficit and debt burden.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order temporarily allowing President Trump to fire officials protected from summary termination, but it also signaled a reluctance to extend this power to members of the Federal Reserve. The order suggests the Court may be unwilling to allow Trump to disrupt the Fed's ability to make independent decisions about interest rates. The Court's Republican majority appears committed to the "unitary executive" theory, which posits that the president should have full control over officials executing federal laws, but it seems to recognize the potential economic chaos that could result from politicizing the Fed.</p>

          <p>A report suggesting the Trump administration is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. military personnel from South Korea has caused anxiety in the country, especially with a snap presidential election approaching. The plan reportedly involves moving around 4,500 troops to other locations in the Indo-Pacific region. Concerns about troop withdrawals have persisted since Trump's first term, when he demanded that Seoul pay more for the U.S. military presence.

          <p>Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, argues that the criticism aimed at Harvard has become excessive and unhinged, despite the university's real issues. He points out the Trump administration's punitive actions, including slashing research funding and forbidding international student enrollment. Pinker suggests that the nation needs proportionality in dealing with educational institutions, diagnosing specific issues rather than resorting to destructive measures. He acknowledges concerns about academic freedom and viewpoint diversity but contends that Harvard is far from the "woke madrasa" its critics portray.</p>

          <p>Wage garnishment is a serious financial consequence, especially when it comes to unpaid taxes. Tax relief strategies, such as installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, and Currently Not Collectible status, can help resolve debt and halt garnishment. Acting quickly and choosing the right strategy is crucial. If wages are already being garnished, verifying the debt and contacting the IRS or a tax relief specialist is recommended to negotiate a resolution or demonstrate financial hardship.
