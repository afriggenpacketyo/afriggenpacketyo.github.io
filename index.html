          <p>President Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on imported cars has triggered varied responses from automakers, including production halts, temporary layoffs, and strategic price adjustments. Stellantis temporarily halted production in some Mexican and Canadian plants, resulting in layoffs in Michigan and Indiana, while Jaguar Land Rover paused U.S. shipments. Hyundai and Toyota are holding off on price increases for now, while Ferrari has raised prices on some models.

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and preventing further issuance due to South Sudan's failure to accept the return of its citizens. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused the South Sudanese government of "taking advantage of the United States" by not complying with repatriation efforts. This action reflects the Trump administration's strict stance on immigration enforcement and its willingness to use diplomatic measures to compel other countries to cooperate with deportation policies.

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, arguing the judge lacked the authority to issue such a directive. Government attorneys claim the order infringes on the executive branch's power to conduct foreign policy. This case highlights the ongoing legal battles surrounding immigration enforcement and the administration's stance on deportations. It remains to be seen how the appeals court will rule.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. While the IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, they admit they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached "suspiciously" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. A mobile video showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people.</p>
