          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is reportedly phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove footwear during security screenings at some U.S. airports. While an official list includes six airports, travelers at other major hubs like LAX and LaGuardia have also reported not having to take off their shoes. The TSA has not officially confirmed the policy change but stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security. This development suggests a significant shift in airport security protocols that have been in place for over two decades.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is reportedly collaborating with former presidential candidate Andrew Yang on a potential new third party, tentatively named the "America Party." The discussions come after a public falling out between Musk and former President Trump, whom Musk had previously supported and advised. Yang, who founded the independent Forward Party, confirmed he is happy to help anyone move beyond the current two-party system. This development signals Musk's serious intent to disrupt the American political landscape, despite skepticism from Trump, who called the idea "ridiculous."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics has forecasted a 56% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of analyst expectations. The decline is attributed to inventory value adjustments and struggles to meet the high demand for advanced AI chips, particularly from industry leader Nvidia. The company has been lagging behind competitors like SK Hynix in the production of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips essential for AI processors. This guidance reflects ongoing challenges in Samsung's semiconductor division and its foundry business, which faces intense competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times criticizes the Trump administration's priorities, highlighting a recent show of force by federal agents in L.A.'s MacArthur Park. The author contrasts the billions allocated for ICE and border enforcement with significant budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health and agencies that forecast weather and climate events. The article argues that these policies reflect a misguided focus on immigration as the nation's greatest threat, while neglecting critical scientific research and preparedness for climate-related disasters. The raid is described by local officials as a political stunt intended to provoke fear.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to implement a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in August. The VA now states that it is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, making the mass layoffs unnecessary. The initial plan considered cutting up to 80,000 jobs to return staffing to 2019 levels. Critics, however, argue the high attrition rate is not natural and points to a toxic work environment that could still negatively impact veteran care.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to release the first part of its final report, which will focus on the human impact and compensation for victims. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongfully prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system. While the findings on their treatment are expected to be damning, the section assigning blame to specific individuals and entities will not be published until a later date, possibly in 2026. Victims are hopeful the report's recommendations will accelerate the process of receiving full and fair compensation for their losses.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the UK is being viewed as a crucial opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the two nations, with King Charles playing a significant diplomatic role. The visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, aims to reset ties that were strained by negotiations and to reinforce cooperation on defense and security. Analysts note that King Charles, a known francophile, has been instrumental in this diplomatic push, helping to navigate complex issues from military support for Ukraine to migration. The pageantry of the visit underscores a deeper strategic necessity for a renewed alliance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer advised investors against major selling in response to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting the figures are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than final policy. He argued that the Trump administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and that the ultimate goal may be to boost U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, Cramer believes the tariffs may not significantly impact inflation or the Federal Reserve's decisions. He pointed to economic stimulus within Trump's new spending bill as another key factor for investors to consider. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale operation involving federal officers and National Guard troops, some on horseback and in armored vehicles, descended on the MacArthur Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, drawing condemnation from local leaders. Mayor Karen Bass called the raid, which appeared to result in no arrests, a "political stunt" and an "intimidation tactic." The historic immigrant neighborhood was largely empty during the hour-long operation. Activists and officials characterized the event as a "reality TV spectacle" designed to instill fear in the community as part of the Trump administration's ramped-up immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism for taking a vacation to Greece as his state was hit by deadly floods, which killed over 100 people. The scrutiny is intensified by reports that Cruz successfully inserted language into a recent Republican spending bill that slashed millions in funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to improve weather forecasting. Critics argue these cuts weakened the very systems meant to warn the public about such disasters. Cruz has dismissed the criticism as "partisan finger pointing," while the Trump administration called the flood an "act of God."</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 6.8% on Monday, erasing $79 billion from the company's market capitalization. The decline is linked to investor anxiety over CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he is forming a new political party, the "America Party." Analysts suggest that shareholders are concerned Musk's deepening involvement in politics will serve as a distraction and could create further friction with the White House. The move follows a recent public feud between Musk and former President Trump, adding to a volatile period for the electric carmaker's public image and stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Atlantic argues that U.S. foreign and defense policy is suffering from a lack of clear leadership, with President Trump's interest being episodic and key cabinet positions filled by inexperienced loyalists. The article suggests that in this power vacuum, lower-level but ideologically driven officials like Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby are driving major decisions, such as reviewing the AUKUS pact and halting weapons to Ukraine. This ad-hoc process, common in authoritarian states, means that on many critical global issues, no one appears to be truly in charge of American strategy.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, suspected to have been caused by fireworks, ignited in a hilly area of Laguna Beach, California, leading to evacuation orders for several hundred homes. The "Rancho fire" grew to three acres, but fire officials reported making good progress with the help of firefighting aircraft and ground crews. City officials credited the rapid response and recent wildfire mitigation efforts, such as vegetation thinning and the installation of a high-pressure water tank, for helping to control the blaze. No homes were reported damaged, but the incident serves as a stark reminder of the area's constant wildfire risk.</p>

His lawyer cited the need to protect doctor-patient privilege, an argument the Republican-led committee has dismissed, stating that its subpoena supersedes such confidentiality codes. The confrontation is part of a broader GOP inquiry into Biden's mental fitness during his term, with Republicans claiming some policies may be invalid if he was incapacitated.

          <p>The government of El Salvador has told a United Nations working group that the United States is legally responsible for the more than 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This contradicts the Trump administration's claims that it cannot return the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants, mostly Venezuelans, were deported under the Alien Enemies Act after being accused of gang membership. El Salvador's report states its role was limited to facilitating the use of its prison infrastructure as part of a bilateral agreement, with legal jurisdiction remaining with the U.S.</p>
