          <p>The renowned artist Louise Nevelson, known for her monumental, monochromatic sculptures often incorporating found objects, is being celebrated in new exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Columbus Museum of Art. Her granddaughter, Maria Nevelson, highlights the artist's unconventional nature and her fierce dedication to her craft, which was finally recognized decades into her career. Nevelson, who began her artistic journey after moving to the U.S. from Ukraine, continued creating significant work well into her 70s and 80s, leaving a legacy that encourages individuals to pursue their passions without limitations. The article emphasizes her unique vision in transforming simple, humble materials into powerful, immersive art experiences.</p>

          <p>The popular BBC One show "Strictly Come Dancing" has announced the addition of two new professional dancers, Alexis Warr and Julian Caillon, for its upcoming autumn season. Warr, a winner of the U.S. dance series "So You Think You Can Dance," and Caillon, who has appeared on Australia's "Dancing With The Stars," will join 18 returning professionals. This announcement comes as the show implements new welfare measures following past controversies concerning dancer and celebrity behavior.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's long-standing 'Francafrique' policy, characterized by its deep political, economic, and military ties with former African colonies, is facing significant rejection, particularly in the Sahel region. This shift is forcing French companies, which once enjoyed preferential treatment, to adjust their business strategies amidst growing competition from global players like China, Turkey, and Germany. Some French multinationals are exploring new partnerships with local entities or relocating operations to other African countries to maintain market share. The article highlights that while France's direct presence may be diminishing, companies are seeking more indirect means to remain active in the region.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Strip is experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis, with approximately one million children, nearly half the population, suffering from chronic and potentially irreversible malnutrition. Doctors warn that prolonged hunger is causing permanent damage to children's central nervous systems, leading to potential neurological impairments. Despite Israel's recent announcement of daily 10-hour pauses in fighting for aid delivery and secure routes, the United Nations reports that 100,000 women and children are severely malnourished and require immediate medical care. The article highlights the devastating impact on a generation of children, with many families struggling to find basic food and water.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking in relation to Jeffrey Epstein, has met twice with the deputy U.S. attorney general, Todd Blanche, amidst ongoing political controversy surrounding the Department of Justice's handling of Epstein-related files. These meetings occur as Donald Trump faces scrutiny over a memo claiming no Epstein client list and the decision not to release extensive case documents. Legal experts debate what Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence, might disclose and whether her testimony could lead to a reduced sentence or shed new light on Epstein's network.

          <h2>Analyzing Donald Trump's Economic Philosophy Through 'Dealmaking' and Avarice</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article posits that Donald Trump's approach to leadership and economics is best understood through his concept of 'dealmaking,' which is fundamentally driven by avarice rather than traditional market principles. His career, rooted in real estate, emphasizes personal, adversarial, and often incomplete 'deals' that serve to enhance his brand and wealth, regardless of their market success. The author argues that Trump's policies, such as tariffs, are not about national economic benefit but about maximizing personal prestige and monetary gain, likening his strategy to ancient ceremonial exchange systems. This unique perspective suggests that his 'egonomics' prioritize self-enrichment, even at the expense of established market mechanisms and diplomatic traditions.</p>

          <p>An article argues that Donald Trump's economic policies and persona have paradoxically contributed to a revival of socialist ideas in the United States, particularly among younger generations disillusioned with contemporary capitalism. The piece contends that Trump's 'ersatz capitalism,' characterized by self-enrichment and vilification of free markets, has made severe critiques of capitalism seem valid. While traditional socialism failed in wealth creation, the author suggests modern socialist movements focus on wealth redistribution, often through non-market mechanisms that may not benefit the most vulnerable. This analysis highlights a significant shift in American political-economic discourse, where critiques of the market are gaining traction.</p>

          <h2>The Disappearance of Local Arts Listings and Its Impact on Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 07:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article laments the near disappearance of comprehensive local arts and entertainment listings in major media outlets, such as The New York Times and Time Out, over the past decade. This trend, driven by declining ad revenue and a shift towards click-driven journalism, is severely impacting subcultures and emerging artists who now struggle for visibility. The author, a musician, recounts how these listings were once vital for discovery and career development, and argues that their absence narrows mainstream culture and hinders the organic growth of diverse artistic scenes. The piece suggests that this erosion of cultural documentation will have lasting implications for artists, audiences, and even future historians.</p>

          <h2>The Historical Roots and Ongoing Issues of Tipping in America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article delves into the controversial history of tipping in the United States, revealing its origins in the post-Civil War era as a means to avoid paying formerly enslaved workers fair wages. Economic Policy Institute analyst Nina Mast explains that tipping became a predominant payment method in service sectors to keep labor costs low, with the federal tipped minimum wage remaining at $2.13 an hour since 1991. The piece highlights how this system shifts the burden of wages onto customers and makes workers vulnerable to wage theft due to difficult enforcement. It urges consumers to direct frustration at employers and lobbying groups rather than tipped workers, advocating for a universal minimum wage.</p>

Released as part of a prisoner exchange, former detainees recount being subjected to violence, sexual assault, inadequate food, and inhumane confinement. Human rights groups like Cristosal assert that these accounts, including allegations of beatings and forced acts, constitute torture and potential forced disappearance, as the U.S. government withheld identities and contact from families and lawyers.

Chen Binhua, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, asserted that the DPP's actions were 'completely contrary' to the will of the people and aimed at establishing a 'one-party monopoly.' Beijing, which considers Taiwan an integral part of China, views the DPP's efforts to suppress dissent as creating 'green terror.'

          <p>Many Americans are experiencing significant financial stress and anxiety, leading to delays in major life milestones such as marriage, homeownership, having children, and retirement. A recent poll indicates that six out of ten Americans report the economy has impacted at least one of their life goals due to affordability issues or economic uncertainty. Reader anecdotes in the article highlight challenges like soaring home prices, student loan debt, and unstable markets, which contribute to a sense of lost agency and a feeling that the 'American Dream is a farce.'

          <p>A Norwegian tourist claims he was denied entry to the U.S. at Newark Liberty International Airport after border officials allegedly found a political meme on his phone and questioned him about extremism and drug use.

Legal experts warn that political content or seemingly innocent photos can be used as grounds for denial of entry, especially for non-citizens who have fewer protections.

          <p>Despite widespread community support and a change in Georgia law, community organizer Katie Chubb faces significant obstacles in opening a birth center in Augusta, a 'maternity desert' with high maternal and infant mortality rates.
