        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung is set to introduce a slimmer version of its foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have already released thinner and lighter devices. These Chinese companies have used their slim designs to differentiate themselves from Samsung in the foldable market. Market analysts suggest that the demand for thinner foldable phones is growing as consumers are unwilling to compromise on thickness and weight. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicates that Apple is also planning to enter the foldable iPhone market next year, intensifying competition in this niche segment. The newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet – meticulously crafted and built to last.</p>

          <p>Yoshua Bengio, a leading figure in AI, has launched LawZero, an organization focused on preventing AI from harming humanity, and is developing 'Scientist AI' as a safety mechanism. Scientist AI is designed to calculate the probability of harm from other AIs' actions and block risky ones, acting as a guardrail. Bengio expresses concerns about AI systems developing goals and agency, potentially leading to unintended consequences and loss of human control. He emphasizes the importance of democratically establishing moral guidelines for AI, suggesting Scientist AI can help rationalize ethical debates and ensure AI actions align with human safety specifications. The goal is to design AI that inherently lacks the incentive or ability to cause harm, ensuring that it remains a tool for human benefit.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is urging further negotiations to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict, as President Trump weighs potential military strikes. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel has called on the UK government to support the US if it attacks Iran. Amidst the escalating tensions, Iran's foreign minister has confirmed talks with UK, France, and Germany regarding their nuclear program. The US may seek to use the UK's military base at Diego Garcia for potential strikes, but legal concerns have been raised about the lawfulness of such actions. The prime minister stressed the need for de-escalation and acknowledged Israel's right to self-defense.</p>

          <p>The United States is facing a potentially severe wildfire season with concerns that federal fire crews are underprepared due to budget cuts and staff shortages.

          <p>Estimates suggest that the recent 'No Kings' protests drew between four million and six million participants, potentially making it one of the largest single-day demonstrations in US history. Data journalist G Elliott Morris calculated the turnout to be 1.2-1.8% of the US population, possibly exceeding the 2017 Women’s March. The protests, organized by the progressive non-profit Indivisible, took place on President Trump’s birthday and coincided with a parade celebrating the US Army's 250th anniversary. While some downplayed the attendance, others noted the demonstration's significance in signaling a broader movement of resistance and civic engagement.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is increasingly becoming associated with political engagement, while many voters are more interested in other activities. The article suggests that Democrats need to demonstrate interests outside of politics to connect with a broader range of voters. Historically, successful Democratic leaders have showcased hobbies and interests, but current figures often lack identifiable passions beyond their jobs. The author suggests that Democrats should focus on building audiences through entertainment and then occasionally bring on candidates as guests, and emphasizes the importance of traditional celebrities using their platforms to connect with disengaged voters.</p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), traditionally used by diabetics, are gaining popularity among non-diabetics, particularly within the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement. Prominent figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and wellness influencers advocate for CGMs as tools for weight loss and understanding metabolic health. The devices align with the MAHA ethos of self-reliance and control over one's health, often promoting a low-carb, protein-heavy diet. However, experts caution that CGMs may not provide useful information for non-diabetics and could lead to unhealthy dietary choices, while others suggest that the administration should stop defunding the people studying Americans’ health.</p>

Addressing these vulnerabilities requires increased public investment, stronger cybersecurity measures, and a shift in homeland security priorities away from immigration enforcement towards counterterrorism and infrastructure protection.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federal holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., originating from June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The name 'Juneteenth' combines 'June' and 'nineteenth,' marking the day Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news of the Emancipation Proclamation. Celebrations often include parades, parties, and cultural events, memorializing the joyful anniversary of independence and reflecting on the country's history of slavery. Despite some funding challenges, Juneteenth remains a symbol of unity, power, and resilience, with communities across the U.S. honoring its significance.</p>

The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to protect free speech and academic freedom, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, balancing the right to peaceful protest with the need to ensure no students are intimidated or prevented from attending lectures.</p>
