          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index saw a significant 1.5% rise after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his intention to resign, following political pressure from an election defeat. The broader Topix index also climbed to a record high, reflecting investor sentiment about a potential change in leadership and economic policy. However, the resignation introduces a period of political uncertainty for the country, as the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar and government bond yields continued to rise amid concerns over inflation and fiscal stability.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that President Donald Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska effectively gave the Russian leader what he desired. In an interview, Zelenskyy expressed that Putin's primary goal was to secure a meeting with the U.S. president to project strength, a goal he achieved without making any concessions. Zelenskyy reiterated that ending the war requires more pressure on Russia from Western allies, including stronger sanctions, and criticized some European nations for continuing to purchase Russian energy, which he described as Putin's weapon.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz defeated his rival Jannik Sinner in four sets to win his second U.S. Open men's singles championship. The start of the match was delayed due to enhanced security measures for President Donald Trump, who was in attendance and watched from a luxury suite, drawing a mixed reaction from the crowd. The presence of a sitting president, the first at the event since 2000, caused long entry lines for many spectators as Alcaraz secured the victory and the world number one ranking.</p>

          <p>The trial for Ryan Wesley Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in September 2024, is set to begin in Florida. Routh allegedly hid in bushes at Trump's West Palm Beach golf club and fired a rifle at a Secret Service agent before being apprehended. In an unusual move, Routh has chosen to represent himself in court, despite the judge's strong recommendation against it. The case highlights concerns over political violence in the U.S., occurring just weeks after a separate attempt on Trump's life.</p>

          <p>Micah Parsons made an immediate impact in his debut with the Green Bay Packers, recording his first sack in a 27-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. The play prompted a reaction of disbelief from his former Dallas Cowboys teammate, cornerback Trevon Diggs, who posted on social media that the situation felt unreal. Parsons, a four-time Pro Bowler, was traded to the Packers in a bombshell move and subsequently signed a massive contract extension. The moment highlighted the significant shift in the NFC's defensive landscape following the high-profile trade.</p>

TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak is set to call for more substantial support, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, arguing that the government's promises of change have not yet materialized for many voters. Concurrently, Unite leader Sharon Graham warned that her union, a major Labour donor, may vote to disaffiliate, stating that workers instinctively feel the party is not on their side.</p>

Bayrou initiated the vote himself in an attempt to compel parliament to support his government's austerity budget, which aims to address France's escalating national debt. However, with President Emmanuel Macron's centrist government lacking a majority and parliament deeply fragmented since the 2024 snap election, Bayrou's gamble appears destined to fail, deepening the ongoing political crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump has walked back a previous social media post that critics interpreted as a threat of war against Chicago, stating that his intention is not to "go to war" but to "clean up" American cities. The clarification came after a post on his Truth Social platform referenced the film "Apocalypse Now" and the "Department of WAR," prompting condemnation from Illinois officials. Trump has repeatedly suggested he may deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Baltimore to address crime and assist with immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced an agreement with the United States to secure the release of over 300 of its citizens detained in a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery factory in Georgia. The workers, who were arrested for allegedly working on improper visas, may return home on a chartered flight. This incident has caused diplomatic friction, as South Korean officials expressed that such actions could undermine the country's significant investments in U.S. manufacturing and called for improvements to the work visa system.</p>

          <p>Superchief Gallery, an independent art space in downtown Los Angeles known for championing counterculture artists, is facing a potential closure this month due to financial struggles. The gallery is the latest in a series of local businesses to shutter as the area struggles with post-pandemic recovery, declining art sales, and reduced corporate sponsorships. Co-founder Bill Dunleavy has launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover rent and operational costs, but says the gallery has incurred significant debt while hoping for an economic turnaround that has not yet materialized.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health has clarified that its new plan to make some school vaccinations voluntary will likely not take effect for 90 days. Initially, the policy would only lift mandates for diseases like chickenpox and hepatitis B, while requirements for measles and polio would remain unless changed by future legislation. The move, championed by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, has drawn significant criticism from public health experts who warn it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's tariffs, the government would be forced to issue massive refunds to the businesses that paid them. The administration has asked the court for an expedited ruling to overturn a lower court's decision that found most of the tariffs illegal. Bessent expressed confidence that the administration would win but acknowledged the significant financial disruption that a negative ruling would cause, potentially requiring refunds on half of the tariffs collected.

          <p>The California Republican Party has found a unifying cause in its opposition to Proposition 50, a ballot measure proposed by Governor Gavin Newsom to redraw the state's congressional districts ahead of the 2026 elections. At their fall convention, party members rallied against the measure, which they argue is a Democratic power grab designed to flip Republican-held seats and influence control of Congress. The fight over the proposition, which will be decided in a November special election, has energized the state's minority party and is expected to attract tens of millions in campaign spending.</p>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalization is far from dead and is, in fact, "alive and well in Asia." In an interview, he argues that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin suggests that while globalization is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia as the U.S. partially withdraws, presenting both opportunities and risks for the global system.</p>

          <p>Much of coastal California is expected to experience unseasonably cool weather this week, with temperatures dropping 5 to 15 degrees below normal. The forecast includes thick fog, chilly breezes, and the possibility of scattered showers, a stark contrast to the typical post-Labor Day heatwaves. This pattern will bring relief to Southern California after recent high temperatures but may disappoint Bay Area residents who have already endured an unusually cold summer. The cool-down is attributed to an upper-level low-pressure system moving in from the Pacific.</p>

A spectacular free-kick from Florian Wirtz sealed the win, putting Germany's qualifying campaign back on track after a disappointing start to the campaign.</p>
