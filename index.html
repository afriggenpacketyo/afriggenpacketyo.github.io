Souter became a key figure in the court's liberal wing, often disappointing conservatives with his shift in judicial philosophy. The article details Souter's background, his confirmation hearing, and his tenure on the court, highlighting his role in significant decisions like Planned Parenthood v.

The parade showcased Russian military hardware, including combat drones used in Ukraine, and featured contingents from countries like China and North Korea, highlighting Russia's shift towards the East.

          <p>President Donald Trump has voiced support for a possible tax increase on wealthy Americans, while acknowledging the political challenges it presents within the Republican Party. This consideration comes as Trump engages with House Speaker Mike Johnson on incorporating such a measure into the GOP's tax and spending bill. Trump noted that he would "graciously" accept a small tax increase on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers. He also expressed concern that Democrats would exploit the issue, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to bring the first group of white South Africans, classified as refugees, to the United States, contrasting with the halt of other refugee admissions. Government officials will be present at Washington Dulles International Airport to mark the arrival of Afrikaners, a white minority ethnic group. The South African government disputes the refugee status claims, calling the move politically motivated and questioning the validity of persecution claims. This action follows Trump's executive order suspending refugee admissions and cutting financial assistance to South Africa, accusing the government of supporting enemies of America.</p>

          <p>The White House is preparing to send Congress a rescissions package, aiming to reclaim previously allocated funds amid a broader effort to reduce spending. This move seeks congressional approval for cuts, addressing legal challenges to the administration's spending reductions. The rescission process allows Congress to cancel unspent discretionary funds, redirecting them or returning them to the Treasury general fund. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed eagerness for the package, anticipating its passage for fiscal year 2025. The initial package is expected to target around $9 billion in spending, focusing on foreign aid and public broadcasting systems.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that resolving the air traffic control problems at Newark Liberty International Airport will take several months, with normal operations expected by summer.

The plan includes new software, updated equipment, and new ATC centers. Duffy emphasized that safety is the top priority, leading to potential delays or cancellations when concerns arise, and expressed alarm about the outdated equipment throughout the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>A five-year-old grizzly bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058, died after being hit by a vehicle in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, mirroring the fate of his famous mother, Grizzly No. 399, who died in a similar accident last year. No. 399 was the oldest known reproducing female grizzly in the Yellowstone ecosystem and was beloved by many. Park officials are reminding visitors to be vigilant while driving, as wildlife is often near roadways and can unexpectedly cross the road. The National Park Service reported that 49 grizzly bears died from vehicle collisions between 2009 and 2023.</p>

A company study confirmed that self-collected samples using the device are as accurate as clinician-collected samples. The test is expected to increase screening rates, providing a more convenient and comfortable option for women.

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that Democrats cannot effectively win over Trump voters by prioritizing climate change. While young voters are concerned about climate change, it is not a top priority for the broader electorate. Voters, including young ones, prioritize issues such as the cost of living, the economy, and inflation, where Republicans hold an advantage. Focusing more on climate change risks alienating voters who feel Democrats do not share their priorities. The analysis suggests Democrats should concentrate on bread-and-butter issues to regain support.</p>

The court heard that Ojiri sold artwork worth Â£140,000 to Ahmad, who was sanctioned by the US in 2019.

          <p>President Trump indicated he is willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, but the rate remains high compared to the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement and may still be prohibitive to trade. The decision comes ahead of key trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland. The current tariff rate on many Chinese goods is 145%. China is one of the U.S.' largest trading partners, with significant trade volume in both exports and imports. Trump also emphasized the need for China to open up its market to the USA.</p>

The defense alleges that Hochman's actions and statements demonstrate a "genuine risk" that the brothers will not receive a fair hearing.
