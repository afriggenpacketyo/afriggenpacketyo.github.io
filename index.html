          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a search and raising concerns about security failures and potential assistance from within the Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff Susan Hutson cited defective locks and the removal of a toilet from a cell as contributing factors, indicating a possible inside job. Officials are investigating multiple security lapses, including how the inmates were able to remove a toilet and force open sliding doors. The escape has drawn criticism from officials, including Louisiana’s attorney general and the Orleans Parish district attorney, who called for an investigation and expressed concern for witnesses involved in the inmates’ cases. </p>

          <p>New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years began, leaving thousands of commuters stranded due to a wage dispute between New Jersey Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. Negotiations broke down late Thursday night, leading to picketing at stations and the shutdown of rail service. Governor Philip Murphy apologized to commuters, blaming union leaders for refusing a fair offer, while the union argues for wage parity with other railroads serving New York City. The strike impacts approximately 350,000 NJ Transit riders and contingency plans involving chartered buses are not scheduled to begin until Monday, leaving many scrambling for alternative transportation. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has maintained its block on the Trump administration's deportations of Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, pending a legal challenge. The order grants an emergency injunction sought by the ACLU, arguing the deportations violated the Supreme Court's prior ruling requiring reasonable notice and habeas claims. Justices Alito and Thomas dissented. The ACLU contends the administration moved Venezuelans to the Bluebonnet facility in Anson without adequate notice, planning to deport them to El Salvador, and that the Trump administration's actions do not give Venezuelan migrants in northern Texas who are at risk of removal under the Alien Enemies Act a "realistic opportunity" to pursue judicial relief. </p>

          <p>ICE has arrested several illegal aliens in Massachusetts who were previously released due to the state's sanctuary policies, some of whom were convicted of serious crimes. One arrest involved an illegal migrant convicted of soliciting to commit murder, who was released by Brockton District Court despite an ICE detainer. Another involved an illegal alien from Haiti, previously arrested for assault and battery, who was released by local authorities and later accused of victimizing more Americans, including a pregnant woman. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized sanctuary policies as endangering American lives, while Massachusetts court officials maintain they lack the legal authority to hold individuals solely on the basis of a Federal Civil Immigration Detainer. </p>

While agencies haven't found contaminant levels likely to pose health risks to beachgoers, the ecological damage dwarfs available measurement tools. Seawater safety testing primarily targets sewage, not fire debris, and lacks clear health guidelines for contaminants like heavy metals.

          <p>A House amendment to the Republican budget package, which would allow the sale or transfer of about 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah, is facing opposition from within the Republican party, threatening the passage of President Trump's budget bill. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, former secretary of the interior, has voiced strong opposition to the amendment, reflecting concerns over the exploitation of public lands. The amendment reflects the priorities of Doug Burgum, the current interior secretary, who views federal lands as assets to solve the nation’s affordable housing crisis. The proposed sale has sparked controversy, as it could lead to the development of vacation homes near Zion National Park and threatens a century of progress in public land conservation. </p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners, defying Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson. Republican Reps. Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman and Chip Roy all voted against clearing the bill out of committee, complaining that the bulk of savings in the legislation don't take effect until after Trump leaves office. The move is a setback for Johnson and Trump, who had called on the holdouts to unite behind the bill. House Republican leaders will continue to negotiate with holdouts behind closed doors, and the Budget Committee will reconvene on Sunday night at 10 p.m. </p>

The fire has been contained, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause.

          <p>The Trump administration is trying to axe Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird in the southern Great Plains, arguing that federal officials made an error when listing the bird. Scientists say that protections are justified: The population of lesser prairie-chickens has crashed since the last century from hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of birds to roughly 30,000 today. The move reveals that the administration will take extreme steps to undo wildlife protections if they stand in the way of his agenda. If his administration is successful in delisting the bird, it will signal that no endangered species is safe — especially those, like these chickens, that happen to live where fossil fuels are buried. </p>
