          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 02:42:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger growth than anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, expanding by 0.7% compared to analysts' forecasts of 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics attributes this growth primarily to the robust performance of the UK services sector, along with a notable increase in production. March also saw a growth of 0.2%, exceeding expectations of stagnation, indicating positive momentum in the early months of the year. This economic expansion suggests a potential recovery and resilience in the face of ongoing global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Two British academics have identified a manuscript in Harvard Law School's library as an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta, a foundational document for modern liberties. The manuscript, purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, was previously believed to be a copy. This discovery makes it one of only seven originals from that date still in existence. The find was made by Professor David Carpenter while researching digital images and confirmed through spectral imaging, underscoring the document's historical significance and its potential value, estimated to be in the millions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the United States and China, has cautioned that their collective economic growth is at risk of a significant slowdown due to trade tensions and policy uncertainties. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forecasts a decrease in growth to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year. Carlos Kuriyama, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit, noted that tariff hikes and non-tariff barriers are creating an unfavorable trade environment, leading businesses to delay investments until the situation becomes more predictable.</p>

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have passed legislation to provide additional legal protections for police officers, setting new legal standards for the use of force and offering immunity hearings. Republicans argue the bill supports law enforcement by providing a clear legal framework, while Democrats express concerns that it could enable police misconduct, particularly against Black individuals. The bill allows an immunity hearing where a judge determines if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside their duties, and it now awaits Governor Ivey's signature to become law.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by a significant surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, although potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to be a major factor. The IMF projects Denmark's output to decrease from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026, due to anticipated weakness in export growth. The report notes that most Danish drug products are neither produced nor pass through the country, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on the Danish economy.</p>

          <p>What was long thought to be a copy of the Magna Carta at Harvard Law School is actually an original from 1300, according to British experts. The "Great Charter" is considered a key document in the history of human rights and constitutional law. Experts based their conclusion on the document's size and handwriting, which are consistent with those in the six previously known originals. The experts noted that the discovery is timely as Harvard University has been barred from receiving new federal grants by the Trump administration, which many critics see as violating some of the key principles enshrined in the Magna Carta.</p>

The new measures include tighter restrictions on citizenship, requiring immigrants to spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment to secure a passport. Immigrants seeking permanent residency must also provide proof of income and have clean criminal records from their home countries. The decree also facilitates the deportation of migrants who enter the country illegally or commit minor crimes, and it mandates that all travelers have health insurance.</p>

The emergence of drone warfare and precision-guided munitions has caused red lines to fade.

          <p>The average cost of private school education in the UK has increased by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government estimates, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) anticipates a decrease in private school applications due to the increased costs. The average termly fee for a day school in January was £7,382, including 20% VAT, compared to £6,021 the previous year. A Treasury spokesperson says the increase in fees are not only down to VAT and the data "misrepresents reality".</p>

European leaders rejected direct talks without an unconditional ceasefire. The conflict has seen several short-term agreements repeatedly breached, with both nations accusing each other of violations.
