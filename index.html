          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations amid trade pressures from the United States. This growth was primarily driven by strong net exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP increase. Despite this positive quarterly performance, year-over-year growth slowed compared to the first quarter. The Bank of Japan has upgraded its fiscal year forecast but remains cautious about the impact of global trade policies on the nation's corporate profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decline after the collapse of the American steel industry, is undergoing a steady revitalization. Local entrepreneurs are repurposing old industrial buildings, such as abandoned factories, into new businesses like breweries and flea markets, injecting new life into the community. While the comeback is not dramatic, the city's population has stabilized and its unemployment rate has improved significantly. This gradual progress demonstrates a story of resilience and forging a new identity beyond its steel-producing past.</p>

Swift explained that she successfully challenged this notion by introducing them to her docile Ragdoll cat, Benjamin Button, and now the children enjoy spending time with her pets. The conversation also hinted that Jason Kelce's family might be considering getting a "barn cat" of their own in the future.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of failing to implement adequate safety measures to protect its young users. Attorney General Liz Murrill alleges that the platform's environment allows sexual predators to easily connect with and victimize children. The lawsuit claims Roblox prioritizes growth and profits over child safety, citing a lack of effective age verification processes.

          <h2>New Poll Reveals Two-Thirds of Americans Feel Tipping Expectations Have Increased</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, roughly two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. Many respondents view this trend negatively, often seeing it as an additional cost rather than a way to show appreciation or compensate service workers. The sentiment appears linked to broader public concerns about rising prices and the cost of living. The survey suggests a cultural shift in tipping norms that is not being well-received by the public.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. This campaign addresses growing concerns over UK citizens seeking cheaper procedures like hair implants and dental work overseas, which can lead to life-altering injuries. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor, purchase proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgery. The initiative aims to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched procedures.</p>

Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative imperative, cited a desire for inclusion and business realities for the reversal. He noted that the all-vegan concept was difficult for corporate event bookings and that wine sales had declined without traditional meat pairings.

          <p>A BBC analysis reveals that Israeli society is deeply fractured over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza, nearly two years after the conflict began. While Netanyahu maintains a message of unity and total victory, significant divisions exist between secular and religious groups, and on the issue of prioritizing a hostage deal versus continuing the offensive. Polls indicate that while most Jewish Israelis support the military's actions and are not troubled by Palestinian suffering, a growing protest movement is calling for a ceasefire. These internal chasms highlight the complex political and social landscape Netanyahu is navigating.</p>

This sentiment is amplified by the Chinese government, which uses the memory of the war to foster patriotism.

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped more than 10% in after-hours trading following the release of a disappointing forecast for the current quarter. The company cited macroeconomic uncertainties and a challenging policy environment, which are particularly impacting its business in China. Applied Materials anticipates a decline in revenue due to reduced demand from China and timing issues with leading-edge customers. The weak outlook overshadowed third-quarter results that actually beat Wall Street estimates for both earnings and revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comedian and actor Paul Rodriguez was arrested in Burbank on suspicion of misdemeanor narcotics possession, marking his second such arrest in the city in less than five months. Police conducted a welfare check after a witness reported Rodriguez and a female companion appeared to be under the influence. Officers allegedly found Xanax and suspected fentanyl in Rodriguez's vehicle, while the woman was also arrested for possessing heroin and Xanax. Rodriguez has disputed the charges from his previous arrest in March, claiming the drugs belonged to someone else.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration actions that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to cut federal funding for institutions with DEI initiatives. Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, stated the administration's guidance initiated a "sea change" in regulation without following proper procedure. This decision is a significant victory for educational and civil rights groups that had challenged the anti-DEI measures in court.</p>

          <p>While the consumer rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 model was met with criticism, the new AI is finding significant success in the enterprise sector, where the company is focusing its business efforts. Startups and major companies like Box are adopting GPT-5 for its improved performance on complex tasks, faster setup, and lower cost compared to competitors like Anthropic's Claude. OpenAI has built a substantial enterprise sales team to capture this market, even as it faces intense competition and high operational costs. This strategic push indicates a pivot towards monetizing AI through business applications rather than consumer chatbots.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has withdrawn its attempt to use expedited removal proceedings against Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, a Guatemalan woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Her lawyers filed a lawsuit arguing the action was illegal, as expedited removal is legally restricted to immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years. After a judge temporarily halted the deportation, the government agreed to move her to regular proceedings, which grant the right to a court hearing. The case raised concerns that the administration was attempting to unlawfully expand its rapid deportation powers.</p>

          <p>Gregory Rodriguez, a former correctional officer at California's largest women's prison, has been sentenced to 224 years in prison for sexually abusing nine incarcerated women over nearly a decade. He was found guilty on over 60 charges, including sexual assault and battery, in a case that exposed systemic issues of misconduct within the state's prison system. Survivors testified about how Rodriguez used his authority to coerce and assault them in areas without camera surveillance. The case is notable as criminal convictions for on-duty sexual misconduct by prison staff are rare.</p>

          <p>Four years after the U.S. withdrawal and the Taliban's subsequent return to power, life for many in Afghanistan has deteriorated, particularly for women and minority groups. The humanitarian and economic situation remains dire, with widespread poverty and the erosion of basic rights. Despite these conditions, the article notes that the Trump administration has asserted that the situation has improved enough to justify deporting Afghan nationals back to the country. This stance contrasts sharply with reports from human rights organizations and observers on the ground.</p>

The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in companies that are currently out of favor with the market. UnitedHealth's shares rose in after-hours trading following the disclosure.

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency, the virus continues to spread across Africa, with outbreaks now reported in 24 countries. A new, more transmissible strain that emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo is driving the spread, but the global response has been criticized as dangerously inadequate. Despite pledges of aid, vaccine distribution has been slow and limited, with many promised doses failing to arrive. Experts warn that the lack of effective containment is allowing the virus to become further entrenched in the human population.</p>

This expected financial hit led Tapestry to issue a full-year earnings forecast that fell short of Wall Street's expectations.
