          <p>China has denied claims made by former US President Donald Trump that he recently received a phone call from Chinese leader Xi Jinping regarding tariff issues. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman stated that no such call had taken place and reiterated that China and the US have not engaged in consultations or negotiations on tariffs. This denial underscores the ongoing tensions and communication challenges between the two nations regarding trade and economic policies.</p>

          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, which India has attributed to Pakistan, both nations have implemented visa cancellations, leading to heart-wrenching separations of families at the border.

          <p>A trial is set to begin in northern England for two men accused of cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap tree, a landmark along Hadrian's Wall. Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers have pleaded not guilty to criminal damage charges related to the felling of the tree and damage to the ancient wall. The case has drawn significant public attention due to the tree's cultural and historical significance, with potential prison time for such an offense being considered unprecedented.</p>
