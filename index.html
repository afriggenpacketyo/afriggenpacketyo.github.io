        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has stated that President Trump "certainly" has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell if sufficient cause is established. This assertion intensifies the ongoing conflict between the White House and the independent central bank. The administration is currently scrutinizing a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's headquarters, with officials alleging mismanagement and significant cost overruns as a potential pretext for Powell's removal. These actions are widely interpreted as part of a broader pressure campaign to influence the Fed's monetary policy, particularly its decisions on interest rates.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left another in critical condition. The blaze, which broke out Sunday night, also led to over 30 people being hospitalized, including five firefighters who sustained minor injuries. First responders conducted numerous ladder rescues, pulling residents from windows as heavy smoke filled the three-story building. While the facility had sprinklers, officials are investigating the cause of the fire and whether the alarm systems were functional at the time, with the fire chief calling it an "unfathomable tragedy."</p>

          <p>Thames Water has announced a temporary hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people across several English counties, including Berkshire and Oxfordshire, starting July 22. The restriction follows a period of low rainfall and high demand, which has strained water supplies in the Thames Valley. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. The measure has drawn criticism from the GMB Union, which points to the company's significant water leakage issues, though Thames Water states that leakage is at its lowest-ever level.</p>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutual model. This proposal aims to rebuild trust and reform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce the current network of over 11,500 branches, it is seeking a "fresh vision" for the state-owned entity. The consultation will also explore what future services, particularly banking, the Post Office should offer in an evolving market.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary about the 2022 University of Idaho murders, the sister of victim Ethan Chapin has shared his final text to her. Mazie Chapin, Ethan's triplet sister, revealed that hours before his death, he sent her a message saying, "I love you," which she found unusual for their typical communication style. She had invited him to be her date to a sorority formal that evening, after which he was killed alongside his girlfriend and two other students. The revelation offers a poignant personal detail following the recent plea deal by the confessed killer, Bryan Kohberger, which avoided a death penalty trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the current surge in measles cases across Europe and the U.S. is a direct consequence of the anti-vaccine movement that gained traction in the late 1990s. The author traces the issue back to Andrew Wakefield's discredited study linking the MMR vaccine to autism, which sowed a deep-seated and persistent distrust in vaccination. Despite the science being debunked, the resulting vaccine hesitancy has eroded herd immunity, leading to the highest measles rates in decades and the recent death of a child in Liverpool. The piece laments this outcome as a tragic failure of collective rationality and care.</p>

          <p>Following a social media post by Donald Trump threatening to revoke Rosie O'Donnell's U.S. citizenship, legal experts have affirmed that such an action would be unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to all persons born in the United States, and the President has no authority to unilaterally strip it away from a native-born citizen. The threat is the latest development in a nearly two-decade-long feud between Trump and the comedian, who recently moved to Ireland in response to his re-election. O'Donnell has continued to be a vocal critic of his administration from abroad, prompting the recent outburst.</p>

Some players and commentators have expressed concern over the optics for the sport and questioned the consistency and transparency of the anti-doping system.

          <p>A new analysis indicates that Republican-backed energy legislation, signed by President Trump, will cause a significant surge in electricity costs, with the largest impacts felt in states that voted for him. By eliminating federal tax credits and support for cheaper renewable energy sources like wind and solar, the bill is projected to increase average annual household energy costs by $170 by 2035. States like Missouri, Kentucky, and Texas are expected to see the highest spikes. Critics argue the policy forces reliance on less efficient fossil fuels, undermining promises to lower energy costs for Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, trading above $121,000 as U.S. lawmakers prepared for 'Crypto Week' to deliberate on new industry regulations. The rally is fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and growing institutional demand, with some analysts predicting the price could reach $125,000 in the coming months. The proposed legislation, which includes the Genius Act for stablecoins, aims to create a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets and is supported by President Trump. This policy clarity is seen as a major boost for investor confidence and long-term institutional buying. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with top accounts currently offering high yields. While national average rates for one-year to five-year CDs range from 1.67% to 2.01% APY, competitive online banks are providing much higher rates, with some one-year CDs reaching 4.40% APY. To secure the best rates, savers should look to online banks, which have lower overhead, and consider short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a key factor in affordability. As of mid-July 2025, national average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage are around 6.70%, while a 15-year fixed mortgage averages approximately 5.88%. To secure the best possible rate in this elevated environment, borrowers should focus on strengthening their credit profile, as scores in the mid-700s or higher receive the most favorable terms. It is also crucial to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders, as rates and fees can vary significantly, impacting the total cost of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

The escape, which was discovered 24 hours after it occurred, was described by a prison administration director as an extremely rare event that revealed serious systemic dysfunctions. The escapee was found and arrested in a nearby commune, though his accomplice remains at large. An internal investigation has been launched into the security failures.</p>

A recent German study suggested such training improved children's focus, IQ, and long-term academic outcomes. However, other researchers urge caution, pointing to large-scale reviews showing that while these programs can be effective in controlled lab settings, their benefits in real-world classrooms are often limited or non-existent. Critics worry that replacing core curriculum time with cognitive training could be detrimental, especially for disadvantaged students who need dedicated instruction in fundamental subjects like reading.</p>

An expert from the Quincy Institute suggests that if conflicts escalate, Musk could potentially move more research, development, or manufacturing abroad.

          <p>A recent report details how new energy policies signed into law by President Trump could increase annual household electricity costs across the United States over the next decade. The legislation rolls back key tax credits and subsidies for clean energy, which is expected to slow the development of cheaper power sources like wind and solar. According to the analysis, this will force greater reliance on more expensive natural gas, leading to higher bills for consumers. The report provides a state-by-state projection of the average cost increases, with some states like Missouri and South Carolina facing potential annual hikes over $600 by 2035.
