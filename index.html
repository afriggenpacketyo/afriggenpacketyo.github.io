        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a move critics link to political concessions made to the Trump administration. The deal's approval followed Paramount settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump and Skydance promising to end diversity programs and address conservative grievances about media bias. The FCC's lone Democratic commissioner dissented, calling the decision a move that would "erode press freedom." The article also notes the satirical response from the show "South Park," which mocked the company's actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying massive capital expenditures to secure a market-leading position, similar to Google's original search engine success. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased investment in cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests that spending is crucial for developing the most accurate and profitable AI models, despite some Wall Street skepticism and current chatbot inaccuracies.

The article details Marquez's personal journey and the broader legal challenges against the policy, which advocacy groups and experts argue is discriminatory and harms military readiness.

          <p>Thai and Cambodian soldiers clashed along their shared border, resulting in at least 12 deaths in Thailand, primarily civilians. The conflict escalated with exchanges of small arms, artillery, and rockets, and Thai forces reportedly conducted airstrikes on Cambodian military targets. The confrontation was triggered by a landmine explosion that injured five Thai soldiers, leading to a diplomatic fallout with ambassadors being expelled. Both nations have accused each other of initiating the aggression, and the U.S. has expressed grave concern, urging an immediate cessation of hostilities and protection for civilians.</p>

          <p>Intel reported second-quarter revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but its stock declined after the company announced significant spending cuts in its chip manufacturing division. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated there would be "no more blank checks," canceling planned factory projects in Europe and slowing construction in Ohio. The company's foundry business reported a substantial operating loss, and Intel is also reducing its workforce by 15% to cut operating expenses. These measures reflect a strategic shift to impose financial discipline after a period of heavy investment without sufficient demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn Alina Habba's nomination to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a procedural move that allows her to serve in an acting capacity. The decision came after a federal court in New Jersey declined to extend her interim appointment and instead named her deputy to the top prosecutor role. Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized the court's move, leading to a leadership dispute. By pulling the formal nomination, the administration circumvents a federal law that would have prevented Habba from serving as an acting officer while her nomination was pending in the Senate.</p>

The piece suggests that even if the files were politically damaging to Donald Trump, the Biden administration lacked the unilateral authority to release them.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" that Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. Despite historical trends showing the president's party typically loses seats, Johnson believes the GOP has strong offensive opportunities, pointing to Democratic-held districts that President Trump won in 2024. He also defended the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting its tax cuts and other provisions would act as "jet fuel" for the economy and be felt positively by voters. He dismissed polling that shows public disapproval of the law as the result of media misinformation.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, Justice Maria Carroccia, ruled that the prosecution had not met its burden of proof, stating she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable." The high-profile case centered on the issue of consent during the incident, which occurred after a Hockey Canada gala. The players' lawyers stated their clients were relieved, while the complainant's lawyer expressed her deep disappointment with the verdict.</p>

          <p>This article provides context on a massive dam being constructed by China on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Medog county, Tibet. This remote region is geopolitically significant due to its proximity to the disputed border with India. The dam is a central component of Beijing's strategy to develop the region, generate enormous amounts of energy, and strengthen its national security along the contested frontier. The project is thus not only an engineering feat but also a major strategic move with implications for regional power dynamics and water resources.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing powerful laser weapons. The crystal, measuring 60mm in diameter, can efficiently convert laser beams to frequencies that travel long distances through the atmosphere and can withstand immense power levels. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based laser systems capable of disabling satellites in orbit. The development addresses a long-standing challenge in laser technology where the intensity of the laser often damages its own optical components.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants that it deems misaligned with its policy goals. The grants in question, totaling roughly $783 million, are tied to research on topics like gender identity and diversity, equity, and inclusion. A lower court had previously blocked the cancellations and ordered the NIH to reinstate the funding, a decision the administration is now appealing. The administration argues the lower court overstepped its authority and is asking the Supreme Court to halt that ruling and let the grant terminations proceed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit claims these policies intentionally obstruct federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals to federal custody. This legal action follows a recent shooting of a border patrol officer by an undocumented immigrant and public statements by officials promising a crackdown. The city's administration has defended the laws as necessary for community trust while also acknowledging they may go too far in some cases.</p>
