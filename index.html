          <p>Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head during a rally in Bogotá, prompting widespread condemnation. The 39-year-old senator, a critic of the current left-wing President Gustavo Petro, was attacked while addressing supporters, with phone footage capturing the moment he was shot. A 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene with a 9mm Glock-type firearm, and an investigation is underway to determine the motive and any potential accomplices. Uribe underwent surgery and is in critical condition as political leaders from across the spectrum, including President Petro and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, denounce the attack as a threat to democracy. </p>

          <p>A British soldier stationed near a British Army Training Unit in Kenya (Batuk) has been detained following an allegation of sexual assault against a local woman. The alleged incident occurred last month after a group of soldiers visited a bar in Nanyuki, prompting an investigation by the UK military police's Defence Serious Crime Unit. This incident follows previous allegations against British soldiers at the Batuk base, including a 2012 murder case and claims of mistreatment of local people, leading to increased scrutiny of the UK military's presence in Kenya. The UK Ministry of Defence has stated that such behavior has no place in the Armed Forces and that all serious crime reports are investigated independently from the chain of command.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that millions of adults seek chiropractic treatment, prompting experts to discuss the potential benefits and risks associated with this form of care. Chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, while spine doctors undergo extensive medical training and base decisions on scientific research. Potential benefits of chiropractic care include reduced tension, inflammation, and stress, while experts caution against seeking chiropractic treatment for more serious underlying issues, as it could lead to complications or spinal cord injury. Experts advise individuals to seek transparent chiropractors with clear treatment plans and to consider a multidisciplinary approach to spine care. </p>

          <p>NPR and PBS's Frontline collaborated on a two-part series investigating why communities struggle to rebuild effectively after natural disasters, focusing on Hurricane Helene's impact in North Carolina and comparing it to recovery efforts in Houston, New York, and New Jersey. The investigation reveals that despite the federal government spending billions annually on disaster relief, communities often fail to rebuild in ways that would protect them from future storms, with powerful forces undermining better building choices. The story highlights debates over whether governments should mandate resilient building practices, the role of the National Flood Insurance Program, and the influence of developers and special interests. Ultimately, the series questions whether there is a coherent plan for disaster recovery and resilience, or if communities are simply rebuilding the same vulnerabilities. </p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized the urgent need to strengthen Ukraine's air defense capabilities and called for concrete signals from the United States regarding air defense systems. Zelenskyy framed Russia's intensified attacks and civilian casualties as evidence that President Vladimir Putin is insincere in his willingness to negotiate peace. Recent weeks have seen an escalation in long-range strike operations from both sides, despite ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending the three-year invasion.</p>

Museums in Trier, Germany, are co-hosting an exhibition exploring his life and philosophy, emphasizing the relevance of his teachings in today's crisis-ridden and polarized world. Aurelius's "Meditations," written for personal reflection, offer insights into maintaining equanimity, acting for the common good, and leading a virtuous life.

He stated that returning to Tottenham is "not realistic" given his commitment to the USMNT, where he was appointed in October 2024. This comes after Tottenham sacked Ange Postecoglou despite leading the club to its first trophy in 17 years, fueling speculation about Pochettino's potential return, where he had a successful five-year stint previously. Pochettino emphasized his focus on his current role and the USMNT's performance, particularly after a recent friendly loss to Turkey.</p>

          <p>Rwanda has announced its withdrawal from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) due to ongoing tensions with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). This decision follows accusations that Rwanda supports the M23 armed group, which has seized significant territory in eastern Congo, leading to broader conflict between the two nations. Rwanda's withdrawal was triggered after it was blocked from assuming the rotating presidency of ECCAS, which it condemned as a violation of its rights and accused Congo of "instrumentalization" of the bloc.

While the Institute of Physics welcomed the funding, they emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers, and Wellcome warned that visa costs for scientists and financial challenges at universities could hinder the government's ambitions.

The corresponding author Cui Xuejing, an associate researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ National Centre for Nanoscience and Technology, said that this is the first time in the world that microplastics have been found to enter the body’s metabolic cycle.

Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.

          <p>Nearly six decades after humans first walked on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are showing renewed interest in lunar missions. NASA's Artemis program and a joint China-Russia project aim to establish permanent bases on the moon for scientific research and as a stepping stone to Mars. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, which could be used to support lunar bases and future space exploration. These lunar bases could also serve as training grounds and transit lounges for astronauts on their way to Mars, with the long-term goal of facilitating more distant space travel.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed any possibility of him returning to Tottenham Hotspur, stating it is "not realistic" for him to leave his current role as the US men's national team manager. Pochettino's comments came after the USMNT's 2-1 loss to Turkey in a friendly match, amid speculation that he was a candidate to replace the recently sacked Ange Postecoglou. Pochettino, who previously managed Tottenham from 2014 to 2019, reiterated his commitment to the US national team, despite a mixed bag of performances in his first nine months.</p>

With the review allocating resources between departments, it will indicate the government's priorities, but the question remains whether the government can convince potential investors that its economic vision is real. Chief executives express concerns about the government's apparent fear of its own shadow, urging it to prioritize long-term challenges such as industrial energy prices, social care costs, and worker illness.</p>

          <p>The UK's plans to modernize and potentially expand its nuclear weapons arsenal, as outlined in the 2025 strategic defence review (SDR), are undermining international non-proliferation efforts and fueling a global nuclear arms race. The decision to spend an additional £15bn on nuclear warheads for Dreadnought-class submarines is seen as a continuation of a redundant and immoral deterrence policy. This move contradicts the UK's obligations under the non-proliferation treaty and sends a cynical signal to other nations, potentially increasing the risk of nuclear warfare. The author argues that retaining or increasing nuclear weapons does not enhance Britain's safety and advocates for gradual disarmament instead of rearmament.</p>
