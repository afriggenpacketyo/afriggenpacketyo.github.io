The inclusion comes after both companies, which went public in 2021, previously faced exclusion from the index. They will replace MarketAxess Holdings and Caesars Entertainment, respectively, adding to the index's significant concentration of technology companies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to officially rename the Department of Defense back to its historical name, the "Department of War." During the signing, Trump stated the change "sends a message of victory, a message of strength," criticizing the previous name as "politically correct or woke." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supported the move, asserting it restores the "warrior ethos" to the military and signals a shift toward a more offensive and decisive posture. The order designates "Department of War" as a secondary title pending potential congressional approval.</p>

          <p>The latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, far below the 75,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate also increased to 4.3%, its highest level in years, signaling a weakening economy potentially impacted by President Trump's tariff policies. Furthermore, data revisions showed a loss of 13,000 jobs in June, contrary to previous reports of gains. This negative economic news increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut later this month.</p>

          <p>Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter publicly questioned the status of a complaint against Snap's "My AI" chatbot, which the agency referred to the Department of Justice in January. The complaint alleges that the chatbot, powered by OpenAI and Google models, poses significant risks to young users. Slaughter stated that the public deserves to know what has happened with the referral, highlighting the issue amid a White House dinner with major tech CEOs.

          <p>The August jobs report, which showed only 22,000 new jobs and a rise in unemployment to 4.3%, has economists concerned about the health of the U.S. economy. Key takeaways indicate that hiring is stalling, with job growth at its lowest level in 15 years, excluding the pandemic era. Sectors like manufacturing and business services shed jobs, with growth concentrated only in healthcare and social assistance. Experts believe the weak data, partly attributed to trade uncertainty, makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month almost certain.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, under new leadership appointed by President Trump, has voted to vacate the rule banning noncompete agreements for most workers. The ban, finalized in 2024 under the Biden administration, never took effect due to a legal challenge that resulted in a nationwide halt. New FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, while calling some noncompetes "pernicious," argued the nationwide ban was an overreach of authority and favors a case-by-case enforcement strategy instead. This reversal is a significant policy shift affecting an estimated 30 million American workers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was illegal. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke the protections was unprecedented and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The ruling effectively blocks the administration from ending the legal status and work permits for these groups, though the Justice Department is expected to appeal.

While squad selections show a preference for Premier League talent and a more physically imposing style, the team's performance has yet to show a clear departure from the past.

While the weak August jobs report increases expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, it also signals underlying economic weakness. Analysts suggest investors re-evaluate their concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which now dominate the S&P 500, and consider shifting some capital towards defensive and value stocks that have underperformed. This repositioning can help insulate portfolios from a potential market downturn later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Armani revolutionized professional attire with his softly tailored power suits for both men and women in the 1970s and 80s. He was also a pioneer in using Hollywood and red-carpet celebrity endorsements to elevate his brand's global profile.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of crime data challenges President Trump's characterization of Chicago as a "killing field" and "the murder capital of the world." According to FBI data from 2024, Chicago's violent crime rate was down 11% from the previous year and ranked 29th out of 37 large U.S. cities, lower than New York and Los Angeles. While Chicago did record the highest total number of homicides, its homicide rate per capita ranked tenth among large cities. The report notes that crime analysts caution against city-by-city rankings due to differences in data reporting and city boundaries.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett explained her sharp response to a dissenting opinion from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case. Barrett stated that Jackson had made a "spirited argument" that "merited a spirited response," emphasizing that their disagreement was about legal ideas, not personal animosity. Quoting her mentor Justice Antonin Scalia, she said, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people," and affirmed she has "great respect" for Justice Jackson. The exchange occurred in a case limiting nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has announced it will pause a mandate requiring 20% of new car sales to be electric by 2026, while also launching a new "Buy Canadian" policy for federal contracts. The moves are a response to a weakening Canadian economy and the impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly President Trump's 35% tariff on many Canadian goods. The longer-term EV sales targets for 2030 and 2035 will remain in place. The new procurement rules aim to support Canadian industries like auto, steel, and aluminum that have been hit hard by U.S. trade policies.</p>

          <p>The disappointing August jobs report, showing weak hiring and a rising unemployment rate, could lead to further decreases in mortgage rates. A weakening labor market puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by cutting its benchmark interest rate when it meets in September. Economists now believe the Fed may opt for a larger rate cut than previously anticipated. Lenders often price in expected cuts ahead of time, and this new data could accelerate the downward trend in mortgage and refinancing rates that has already been observed this year.</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who attempted to shut down the engines of a passenger flight in October 2023, has pleaded guilty to federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. Emerson was riding in the cockpit jump seat when he tried to pull the fire suppression handles, an act he later attributed to a mental breakdown, lack of sleep, and recent use of psychedelic mushrooms. The plea agreement was reached as Emerson wishes to take responsibility for his actions. The incident, which ended safely after the plane was diverted, prompted renewed focus on pilot mental health.</p>

          <p>At a National Conservatism Conference, U.S. Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri delivered a speech that has been widely condemned as promoting white nationalism. Schmitt argued that America is not a nation based on ideals like equality but is fundamentally a "homeland" for the descendants of white Christian European settlers, calling it "our birthright." He explicitly rejected the idea of a "universal nation" and the proposition that all men are created equal, a direct repudiation of the principles articulated by Abraham Lincoln. The speech has been criticized for its embrace of blood-and-soil nationalism and its exclusion of non-white citizens from his vision of America.</p>

          <p>The sudden resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler in August has become more mysterious following a review of her real estate and financial disclosure records. A CNBC report found an apparent inconsistency, with her primary mortgage listed on a "personal residence" that Maryland state tax records do not list as her "principal residence." Kugler stated this was a county error. The questions surrounding her departure are significant as they come amid a campaign by the Trump administration to remove another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, over alleged mortgage irregularities, as part of a broader effort to influence the central bank.</p>
