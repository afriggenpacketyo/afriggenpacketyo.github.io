          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a popular hot spring town in Japan known for its resemblance to scenes from 'Spirited Away,' is implementing visitor restrictions to combat overtourism and preserve its cultural heritage. The town, which attracts 25 times its population in tourists annually, faced challenges like congestion and littering. Measures include shuttle buses and timed entry to limit hourly visitors, aiming to maintain the town's serene atmosphere and protect its traditional architecture from the Taisho period. Initial surveys show improved congestion and visitor support for the restrictions.</p>

          <p>China is undergoing a shift towards a technocratic meritocracy, with a growing number of high-ranking officials holding PhDs and possessing technical backgrounds. According to a study by the Asia Society, nearly half of the Communist Party's youngest cohort of bureau-level officials hold doctoral degrees. This pivot towards competence over ideology marks a philosophical shift rooted in Chinese tradition, potentially giving China a competitive edge in its rivalry with the United States.</p>

          <p>Many tech workers in China are concerned about the "curse of 35," a term describing the risk of being laid off once they reach that age due to growing age discrimination. The phrase has become widely used to suggest growing age discrimination amid a tight job market in the country. Many online job listings, including civil service posts, state explicitly that candidates should be no older than age 35. This article explores the reasons behind this phenomenon and the sectors most affected.</p>

          <p>Residents of Boca Chica, Texas, near Elon Musk's SpaceX facility, voted overwhelmingly to establish a new city called Starbase. The initiative, championed by Musk, passed with 173 out of 177 votes, marking a significant step in realizing his vision for the area. As a municipality, Starbase would be eligible for state and federal grants, would have certain immunity from lawsuits and could also condemn property. The community, largely comprised of SpaceX employees, will now have the opportunity to shape its own governance and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>California Democrats are facing an uncomfortable question: are their leaders simply too old? A resolution initiated by San Francisco Democrats proposes exploring a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders, reflecting concerns about leaders holding onto power past their prime. The debate is fueled by regrets over Senator Dianne Feinstein's declining health and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decision not to retire earlier. While some argue that experience brings valuable gravitas, others believe it's time to make way for younger candidates with fresh perspectives.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's election as Prime Minister of Canada marks a potential shift in the country's approach to the trade war with the United States under President Trump. Carney campaigned on a platform of standing up to Trump's "betrayal" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. His victory, fueled by concerns over Trump's tariffs and overtures to annex Canada, may lead to a more assertive stance in defending Canadian interests and promoting economic independence from the US.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave", suggests that the papal selection process shares similarities with the hit TV show "The Traitors". Harris, whose book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, explains that the dynamic of cardinals trying to identify the right leader is similar to the show's premise of "faithful" contestants trying to identify the "traitors" among them. He also argues that political parties should learn from the conclave's secretive ritual, believing it's a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right person to lead an organization.</p>
