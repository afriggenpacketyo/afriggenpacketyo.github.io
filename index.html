        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area, marking only the second time in history the National Weather Service's Chicago office has issued such a warning. The storm was caused by strong winds blowing over dry farmlands, picking up dust and reducing visibility to near zero in some areas, including major interstates and airports. Showers and thunderstorms accompanied the dust storm, leading to reports of "mud rain" in some locations. Power outages were reported, leading to some school closures as well. Optimism for this article is based on the lack of human injury, and the relative rarity of the event.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark spoke about the importance of rivalries in sports as she prepared to face Angel Reese in the WNBA season opener between the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky. Their rivalry began during the 2023 NCAA championship game and continued into their rookie WNBA seasons, marked by intense matchups and controversial fouls. Clark's team won three of the four meetings last year, and the games were among the most-watched of the season.

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants located in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's announcement earlier in the week that it would be shutting down seven vehicle plants and reducing its workforce by 20,000 employees globally, in response to a net loss of 670.90 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for fiscal year 2024. The closures are part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and improve financial performance amid challenging market conditions.</p>

          <p>Angels Flight Railway, an iconic funicular in downtown Los Angeles, will raise its fares from $1.00 to $1.50 starting June 1, marking its first price increase since 2017.

Despite a history of safety challenges, including a fatal accident in 2001, the railway has been operating with new safety standards since reopening in 2017. The price increase is intended to maintain the railway's operations and historical preservation.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg discusses the Democratic Party's struggle to acknowledge Joe Biden's declining health, referencing Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book "Original Sin," which highlights the "cover-up" surrounding Biden's condition. Goldberg argues that the party's groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion led to a collective failure to address the issue. While Biden's inner circle restricted access to shield him, many Democrats were in denial about his obvious infirmity. Goldberg suggests that a reckoning is needed to learn from these mistakes and earn back credibility with voters.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination via a coded message in a seashell-themed Instagram post. The post, featuring seashells arranged to spell "8647," was interpreted by Trump supporters as a threat, with "86" meaning to get rid of something and "47" referring to Trump as the 47th president. The Secret Service launched an investigation, and Comey removed the post, stating he opposed violence and didn't realize the numbers' association with violence.

          <p>A sake brewery in southwestern Japan, Fujii Shuzo, is offering a five-day seminar for foreign sommeliers to teach traditional sake-making techniques. The seminar, organized by the Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to increase awareness and appreciation of sake beyond Japan. The head of Fujii Shuzo believes that opening up to international participants will help increase the value of Japanese sake, similar to beer and wine. This initiative comes as domestic sake consumption declines, while exports are on the rise.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump faced setbacks in both the courts and Congress as he concluded a tour of the Middle East. The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to block deportations of Venezuelans, and right-wing lawmakers derailed his domestic policy bill in the House of Representatives. The bill, aimed at extending tax cuts, faced opposition due to disagreements over federal spending. These events mark significant challenges for the Trump administration as it navigates domestic and international issues.</p>

          <p>An audio clip from President Joseph R. Biden Jr.â€™s 2023 special counsel interview was released, revealing Biden speaking haltingly and struggling to recall key dates.

Republicans have long sought the release of the audio, arguing it might offer evidence of a decline in Biden's mental acuity. The emergence of the recording coincides with new revelations about Bidenâ€™s health while in office.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful" package of tax breaks and spending cuts has stalled in the House of Representatives due to Republican budgetary divisions. Conservative congressmen are demanding steeper cuts to the budget, particularly in Medicaid and other social security programs. The bill's proposed tax breaks total about $4.9 trillion, partially offset by cuts to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks. The disagreement centers on how much to slash from the budget to avoid swelling America's public debt, which currently stands at $36 trillion.</p>
