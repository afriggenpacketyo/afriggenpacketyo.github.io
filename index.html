          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a surge in its Hong Kong trading debut, with shares jumping over 18% as investors expressed confidence in the company's capacity to leverage the expanding electric vehicle market. The IPO successfully raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), purportedly becoming the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to allocate 90% of the raised capital to construct its forthcoming factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to prominent European automotive clients, including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen.

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s revelation of an aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has temporarily disrupted Democrats' efforts to address their missteps during his presidency and the 2024 election. The announcement prompted an outpouring of sympathy, but also raised questions about the timing of the disclosure and the transparency of his health while in office. Some, like former Representative Dean Phillips, suggested the announcement was timed to deflect growing criticism. Despite expressions of support, the diagnosis has underscored the complexities of Biden's legacy, particularly concerning his age and health during his presidency, as detailed in this New York Times article.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, faces charges of assaulting federal agents following a clash at an immigration detention center in New Jersey, according to U.S. Attorney Alina Habba.

Meanwhile, a trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during the same incident, has been dismissed. The article also mentions reactions from Democratic leaders and legal advocates, who condemn the charges against McIver as an attempt to deter legislative oversight of immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Portugal's recent general election, the third in three years, has not produced a decisive outcome to end the country's ongoing political instability. The center-right Democratic Alliance secured a plurality but will still need to rely on opposition parties to govern. The rise of the hard-right populist party Chega adds further uncertainty to the political landscape. Key issues in the election included corruption scandals, immigration policy, and a housing crisis, with Chega gaining traction by advocating for stricter immigration controls.

The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment to remove parental responsibility from convicted child sex offenders, but only if they have abused their own children. The family expressed disappointment, as they believe the law should automatically remove parental responsibility after a criminal conviction for serious child sex offenses, regardless of whether the abuse was directed at their own children.

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Andrea Kendall-Taylor argues that the Trump administration's frustration with the lack of progress in Ukraine peace negotiations is misguided. She contends that the war is not solely a European issue, but directly affects American interests due to Putin's broader ambitions to undermine the post-Cold War order and diminish U.S. influence. The article emphasizes that abandoning the peace process now will only increase the costs of resisting Russia's aggression in the future, especially considering Moscow's increasing sabotage and weaponization of migrants.</p>

While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range, it also acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook.

          <p>Richard Grenell, appointed by President Trump as the president of the Kennedy Center, has alleged 'criminal' mismanagement and referred the center's deficit and deferred maintenance to federal prosecutors. Kennedy Center officials attributed the deficit figures to a review undertaken by the center’s new chief financial officer. The center also announced its next season will feature some big names in theater and dance, including some with nonunion casts, a break from past practices. Artists have been divided about performing at the center since Mr. Trump became its chairman.</p>
