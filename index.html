          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he was questioned about his handling of the investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination. Patel defended his decision to publicly release photos of the suspect, which he credited for the swift arrest, despite criticism from Democrats for causing "mass confusion" with his social media posts. The hearing also involved tense exchanges regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, with Patel blaming a former U.S. Attorney for initial investigative shortcomings and denying that Epstein was an FBI informant.</p>

          <p>While mortgage rates for new home purchases have seen a decline, refinancing rates for existing homeowners remain relatively high, making traditional and cash-out refinances financially unappealing for many. This article outlines alternative methods for tapping into home equity without altering a current low-rate mortgage. The two primary options discussed are a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which offers a variable rate and flexible borrowing, and a home equity loan, which provides a lump sum with a fixed interest rate. Both methods allow homeowners to access funds while waiting for a more favorable refinancing climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old woman, Courtney Beth Anderson, was arrested and charged with felony battery after allegedly assaulting a 73-year-old event organizer during a vigil for Charlie Kirk. The incident occurred at a gathering held by "The Villages MAGA Club" in a Central Florida retirement community. Witnesses reported that Anderson was behaving aggressively before she allegedly shoved the organizer, Valerie Jamieson, to the ground, causing her to hit her head. This event is one of several disruptions reported at memorials for the slain conservative activist.</p>

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's readiness to allow TikTok to be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that prompted China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that the administration prioritized national security over the commercial aspects of the deal, a stance that ultimately "turned the tide" in negotiations. This development follows a period of tense trade relations and multiple deadline extensions for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations. A final agreement is expected to be confirmed in an upcoming call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have argued for the elimination of mental health screenings in schools, suggesting they "medicalize" normal childhood behavior and create stigma. In a recent op-ed, they proposed that schools should instead focus on "natural sources of mental well-being" like family, nutrition, and fitness. However, mental health experts interviewed by NPR counter this view, stating that universal screenings actually reduce stigma, serve as conversation starters, and help identify at-risk students for early intervention, similar to vision or hearing tests.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of steady increases, the national average FICO credit score in the U.S. has fallen for the second year in a row, now sitting at 715. The decline is attributed to rising financial stress on American households, driven by high interest rates and persistent inflation. Data reveals that delinquency rates for credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans have reached levels not seen since the 2009 financial crisis. Gen Z borrowers have been particularly affected, with a significant percentage experiencing substantial drops in their credit scores, signaling widespread economic strain.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a preliminary investigation into the 2021 Tesla Model Y following multiple reports of inoperable electronic door handles. The probe covers over 174,000 vehicles and focuses on incidents where owners were locked out of their cars, including several concerning cases where parents could not access children left inside. Some owners reported having to break a window to re-enter their vehicle. While the cars have an internal manual release, it may not be accessible or operable by small children, raising significant safety concerns.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders have introduced a short-term spending bill to prevent a government shutdown, funding federal agencies at current levels until November 21. The legislation, known as a continuing resolution, also includes an additional $88 million for security for lawmakers and other officials, a response to heightened threats following Charlie Kirk's assassination. The bill faces an uncertain future, as Democratic leaders have criticized it for failing to address expiring healthcare subsidies and for being drafted without bipartisan negotiation. A vote is expected by the end of the week ahead of the September 30 funding deadline.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's political style, accusing him of fanning the flames of divisive, far-right politics globally. Writing ahead of Trump's state visit to the UK, Khan connects this rhetoric to a recent large far-right protest in London, urging leaders to reject the politics of fear and division. He calls on the UK government to act as a "critical friend" to the U.S., speaking out against actions like scapegoating minorities and tariff wars. Khan asserts that London will remain a beacon of progressive, multicultural values.</p>

          <h2>Calculating Potential Earnings from a 2-Year CD in the Current Rate Environment</h2>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers are looking at long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to lock in currently high returns. This article calculates the potential interest earned on a 2-year CD opened in September, using a competitive annual percentage yield of 4.06%. For example, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $828 over the two-year term, while a $25,000 deposit could yield over $2,000. The analysis suggests that while CD rates have dipped from their recent peaks, they still offer a secure way to earn guaranteed interest. (not investment advice)</p>
