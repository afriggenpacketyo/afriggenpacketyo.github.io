          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to ABC's broadcast schedule this Tuesday, reversing a suspension issued last week. The initial decision to pull the show followed pressure from broadcast station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair after Kimmel linked the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement. After several days of discussions with the host, Disney executives decided to bring the show back, with Kimmel expected to address the controversy on his first episode. The incident has sparked a broader debate about free speech, political pressure on media, and the role of the FCC.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as a potential government shutdown approaches the September 30 deadline. The meeting comes after competing funding proposals failed in the Senate, with Democrats insisting on a bill that addresses their healthcare priorities. Democratic leaders have stated that Republicans will be responsible for any shutdown due to their refusal to negotiate on a bipartisan solution. President Trump has publicly acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown, creating uncertainty as both the House and Senate have left Washington for a recess.</p>

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its 2025 class of astronaut candidates, consisting of ten individuals selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The group, which includes six women and four men, features a diverse range of professionals such as pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will undergo two years of intensive training for potential future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and eventually Mars. The announcement was made amidst budget uncertainties and challenges for NASA's Artemis program, though officials expressed confidence in winning the new space race against China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent announcement linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use in pregnancy to autism has been met with strong skepticism and criticism from scientists and medical professionals. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spearheaded the conclusion, which experts in the U.S. and U.K. have labeled as "fearmongering" and not based on consistent scientific evidence. Critics, including the Autism Science Foundation, point to conflicting studies and argue that such unsubstantiated claims risk undermining public health. The administration's approach has been described as top-down and lacking regard for established scientific processes, causing concern among public health officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ABC has reinstated host Jimmy Kimmel, with his late-night show set to return to air after being suspended indefinitely last week. The network stated the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense situation following Kimmel's comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The suspension itself drew significant reaction, with the FCC Chair threatening regulatory action and major affiliate owners pulling the show.

          <p>The NHS in England is introducing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient presents with the same symptoms three times without improvement. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months. Her family hopes the guidance will prevent similar tragedies by encouraging doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or make specialist referrals sooner. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports the rule as a best practice to catch serious illnesses earlier.</p>

          <p>China has begun drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive blueprint that will dictate the nation's economic and policy priorities from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning strategy is considered a key political advantage by President Xi Jinping, especially in a time of increasing global turbulence. The upcoming plan is crucial for Beijing's ambitious goal of achieving the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions in October, experts suggest that the new plan will need to be flexible, prioritizing qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to navigate domestic and international challenges effectively.</p>

Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, also strongly disagreed, highlighting the health risks of untreated fever or pain during pregnancy.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is expected to be out for three to four weeks after suffering a high ankle sprain during a recent game against the Chicago Bears. The injury occurred in the first quarter when a defender fell across his legs, causing his ankle to twist awkwardly. Lamb, who is quarterback Dak Prescott's primary target, had started the season strong with two consecutive 100-yard receiving games. His temporary absence represents a significant blow to the Cowboys' offense, which will now rely more heavily on other receivers like George Pickens and tight end Jake Ferguson.</p>

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has announced plans to furlough nearly 1,800 flight attendants, which constitutes about one-third of that workforce, starting December 1. The decision is part of a broader effort to cut costs and rightsize the airline as it navigates its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the past year. The company's COO stated that while voluntary leave programs were initially utilized, involuntary furloughs are now necessary to align staffing with a reduced flight schedule. The move comes after Spirit suspended service to several airports and reported significant financial losses in recent months.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 storm in the central Atlantic, becoming the second major hurricane of the 2025 season. The storm's winds increased by 55 mph in just 24 hours, a phenomenon known as rapid intensification that has become more common due to warming oceans. While Gabrielle is not expected to make a direct landfall, it is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward. Forecasters are also monitoring two other weather systems in the Atlantic, one of which has a high chance of developing into the next named storm this week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to reconsider a 90-year-old legal precedent, *Humphrey's Executor*, which protects officials at independent federal agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The decision comes after the court's conservative majority allowed President Trump to remove a Democratic appointee at the Federal Trade Commission. This move signals a potential major shift in executive power, which could undermine the independence of agencies designed to be insulated from direct political control. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing the court's recent actions improperly transfer authority from Congress to the President and reshape the nation's separation of powers.</p>

          <p>Disney's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" prompted widespread backlash, culminating in an open letter signed by hundreds of entertainers, including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Pedro Pascal, in collaboration with the ACLU. The letter condemned the move as a threat to free speech, arguing that voices should not be silenced by those in power. The suspension occurred after the FCC chair, an appointee of President Trump, criticized Kimmel's monologue about the assassination of Charlie Kirk and encouraged affiliate stations to preempt the program. Disney later reversed its decision, announcing the show would return on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>A man accused of shooting at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento left a note citing the government's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and naming several Trump administration officials as being "next." According to a federal complaint, the suspect, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, left a message reading, "For hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags," and mentioned FBI Director Kash Patel, his deputy Dan Bongino, and Attorney General Pam Bondi. The district attorney believes the act was politically motivated, potentially spurred by the recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, as a book critical of President Trump was also found in the suspect's vehicle.</p>

          <p>Edan On, a 19-year-old man charged with misdemeanor assault for swinging a pipe at protesters in a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA, has been granted diversion. This legal arrangement allows him to avoid jail time and have the charge dismissed upon completion of certain conditions, including community service and anti-bias training. The judge cited his youth and lack of a criminal record in the decision, which was made over the objection of prosecutors. The case appears to be one of the final criminal proceedings related to the violent clashes that occurred at the UCLA encampment in May 2024.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are urging treasury inspectors general to investigate allegations that Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, accepted a $50,000 cash payment from an undercover FBI agent. The alleged sting operation, first reported by multiple media outlets, involved Homan promising future government contracts in exchange for the money. Representative Dave Min has requested an investigation into whether Homan reported this payment to the IRS, as all income, legal or illegal, must be declared. The White House has denied the allegations, stating Homan did nothing wrong, though the incident continues to fuel calls for scrutiny over potential corruption.</p>

Routh, who is representing himself, concluded his defense after questioning a firearms expert and two character witnesses. Prosecutors allege Routh spent weeks planning the attack before being spotted by a Secret Service agent, at whom he allegedly aimed his rifle before fleeing. The firearms expert testified that the rifle was prone to jamming and its taped-on scope was likely ineffective. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Mark Spitznagel, a hedge fund manager known for profiting from market downturns, has issued a stark warning about the U.S. economy. He predicts that current conditions are mirroring those of 1929, anticipating a potential short-term market rally that could be followed by a severe crash. Spitznagel argues that repeated federal interventions have created underlying instability, comparing the situation to suppressing small forest fires, which allows for the build-up of fuel for a much larger blaze. He suggests the S&P 500 could see a significant gain before this potential major correction occurs. (not investment advice)</p>
