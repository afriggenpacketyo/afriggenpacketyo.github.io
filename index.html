        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn against the risky credit card behavior known as 'credit cycling,' where users repeatedly max out their credit limit and pay it down to free up more credit. While occasional credit cycling might seem harmless, consistently doing so can lead to card issuers canceling the user's card and revoking reward points, potentially harming their credit score. Credit card companies view this behavior as a red flag, possibly indicating financial difficulty or even illegal activities like money laundering. To avoid these risks, consumers should seek alternative financial solutions instead of relying on credit cycling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's long-held desire for a military parade will be realized during the U.S. Army's 250th-anniversary celebration in Washington, D.C. The idea originated from an Army live-action show that a media executive suggested would make great television, leading to the concept of incorporating tanks and military equipment into a parade. The event, scheduled to coincide with Trump's 79th birthday, has drawn criticism over its cost and perceived politicization of the armed forces. While the White House has not released a cost estimate, the Army's portion alone is expected to cost up to $45 million.</p>

Trump's approach to foreign policy, which prioritizes domestic concerns over international intervention, has been criticized for failing to de-escalate tensions and resolve ongoing conflicts, suggesting a disconnect between his aspirations and the current global reality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is commemorating its 250th anniversary with a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade, featuring tanks, flyovers, and thousands of troops, has sparked controversy, with critics viewing it as a politicization of the military and a vanity project for Trump. Despite the criticism, the event is expected to draw a large crowd and will include a public festival with military demonstrations and live music, concluding with a fireworks display near the White House.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for rain and thunderstorms across the far north of England, eastern parts of Northern Ireland, and much of Scotland after over 30,000 lightning strikes overnight. Torrential downpours caused flooding in areas like Dover, Kent, and disrupted travel, including flight delays at Heathrow Airport. Kent Fire and Rescue Service responded to incidents of flooding, while East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service investigated a lightning strike as the likely cause of a residential fire. The Environment Agency issued flood warnings in the South West, and National Rail reported a landslip disrupting services between Exeter St Davids and Okehampton.</p>

          <p>The UK is engaged in careful diplomacy as it handles the escalating situation in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. The Foreign Office has established 'crisis centers' to manage the situation, with ongoing discussions among leaders and diplomats. While the UK acknowledges concerns about Iran's nuclear program, there is no explicit endorsement of Israel's actions. The Prime Minister's conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu occurred at Netanyahu's request, and the Foreign Secretary is expected to hold further talks with counterparts in the Middle East ahead of the G7 meeting.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli strikes in Iran, questions arise about how close Iran was to producing a nuclear bomb. While Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, Israel claims Iran was months away from weaponization. The IAEA has reported that Iran has amassed enough enriched uranium to potentially make nine nuclear bombs, raising concerns about proliferation risks. The Israeli military claims to have damaged Iran's nuclear infrastructure in the strikes, but the full impact remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to launch air strikes against Iran has undermined negotiations between Tehran and the Trump administration, potentially ensnaring the US in a new Middle East conflict. Despite Trump's desire for a deal with Iran, Netanyahu's actions have increased the likelihood of war, knowing the US will likely provide support. The author argues that Trump's failure to restrain Netanyahu risks further destabilizing the region and undermining Trump's legacy as a peacemaker. The article states that the US taxpayers are footing the bill from the actions of the state of Israel.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive deportation policies and response to immigration protests are presenting political risks, despite general support for decreasing immigration. While some polls show approval for his deportation policies, others indicate disapproval, particularly in response to workplace raids and the deployment of troops. Republican leaders are urging the administration to prioritize deporting criminals over hardworking immigrants, reflecting concerns about the impact on key industries. Democrats are unifying in opposition to Trump's approach, but still face challenges in articulating a clear vision for future immigration policy.</p>
