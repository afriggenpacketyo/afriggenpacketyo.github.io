          <p>Severe flash floods have devastated Texas's Hill Country, resulting in at least 27 fatalities, including nine children. The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. Officials report that dozens of people, including 23 to 25 campers from Camp Mystic, remain unaccounted for as extensive search and rescue operations continue. The state has declared a disaster, with federal support promised, as authorities grapple with what they describe as a "mass casualty event" and a tragedy that unfolded with little warning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon of "tipflation," driven by digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options, is causing confusion and pressure for consumers. While tipping was traditionally for specific service roles, requests for gratuities have expanded to fast-food counters and even self-service kiosks. Experts note that system designs often default to tipping, influencing customer behavior and increasing tip amounts, which benefits both employees and the tech companies processing the transactions. The article suggests that understanding local wage norms and paying with cash can help consumers navigate this evolving social and economic landscape.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, the Reform UK Member of Parliament for South Basildon and East Thurrock, has voluntarily given up the party whip pending an investigation into his business dealings. The allegations, published by the Sunday Times, concern the acquisition of £70,000 in government-backed Bounce Back loans during the COVID-19 pandemic for two companies. McMurdock maintains his business activities were lawful and compliant with all regulations. The party has initiated an internal investigation into the matter, which reduces its number of sitting MPs to four.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted what it describes as a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating its readiness to enter negotiations on implementation details. The proposed deal, previously announced by President Trump, is understood to involve a two-month truce. While Israeli sources indicated cabinet support for the terms, they have not yet formally committed. The development is seen as a potentially significant step toward de-escalating the 21-month conflict, which has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a country with which none of them have ties. The men, originally from countries including Cuba, Mexico, and Vietnam, were at the center of a legal fight that reached the Supreme Court. The court's decision allowed the administration to proceed after the men were held for weeks at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. Human rights advocates have condemned the action as "punitive and unconstitutional," expressing fears that the men could face torture or other dangers in the conflict-ridden nation.</p>

          <p>During a historic 18-1 defeat of the Los Angeles Dodgers by the Houston Astros, Dodgers broadcaster and former pitcher Orel Hershiser alluded to the Astros' 2017 sign-stealing scandal. As the Astros dominated at the plate, Hershiser commented that they seemed to be "swinging at these breaking balls like they know what is coming." The game, which was the worst loss in Dodger Stadium history, saw Astros player Jose Altuve, a member of the 2017 team, homer twice despite relentless booing from the crowd. The comment reopened old wounds from the controversial World Series between the two teams.</p>

          <p>According to security analysts, recent U.S. military actions targeting Iran could strengthen North Korea's resolve to maintain and enhance its nuclear weapons program. Experts suggest that Pyongyang may view these events as confirmation that a nuclear arsenal is the only true guarantee of regime survival against an unpredictable United States. This perception could lead North Korea to prioritize developing a more mobile and survivable second-strike capability. The analysis comes after diplomatic efforts, including historic summits between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, failed to achieve a denuclearization agreement.</p>

          <p>A "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink combining ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium powder, has gone viral on TikTok with claims it can lower stress hormones. However, medical experts interviewed for the article are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, endocrinologists clarify that cortisol levels fluctuate naturally and are not something doctors typically aim to lower outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. They advise that proven stress-reduction methods like sleep, exercise, and social connection are more effective.</p>

The typewriter was a revolutionary attempt to adapt the complex, character-based Chinese language for modern technology, a crucial step toward Chinese computing. Its unique system broke down characters by shape rather than sound, allowing access to thousands of characters and influencing modern input methods for East Asian languages. Now acquired by Stanford University, the machine is seen as a significant artifact representing a vision to preserve Chinese culture in the technological age.</p>

Citing examples of his patients—who face challenges like homelessness, disability, and lack of internet access—he contends that many who should be exempt will lose coverage simply because they cannot navigate the system to prove their status. The author notes that similar requirements in Arkansas led to thousands of eligible people being disenrolled. The policy is framed as an engineered way to disenfranchise those who need care the most.

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Promotes "90-Second Rule" for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage emotional responses to upsetting events. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological effects of anger or stress hormones like cortisol last for only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering feeling is due to mentally re-running the negative thought. Gawdat advises allowing yourself that brief window to feel the emotion, and then consciously choosing to shift your focus, a practice he believes can lead to a more fulfilled and resilient life.</p>

          <p>A Durham shopkeeper who personally apprehended a shoplifter stealing beer has criticized the lack of consequences for the offender. After the man admitted to the theft, he was dealt with through a "community resolution," which involved paying for the stolen goods and being banned from the store, but resulted in no criminal conviction. The shop owner argues this sends the wrong signal and fails to deter future crime, a sentiment that reflects a national issue where a majority of reported shoplifting cases do not lead to charges. The incident highlights growing frustration among retailers over rising theft and perceived inaction.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the Danish secret to happiness, an Emory University professor undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies over one year. She discovered that engaging in activities like pottery, tennis, and woodworking helped her kick her doomscrolling habit, build community, and feel less lonely. The experience fundamentally changed her perspective on self-care and work-life balance, leading to increased confidence and stronger social connections. She concludes that actively pursuing hobbies, rather than waiting for balance to appear, is the key to creating a more fulfilled and joyful life.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Sean "Diddy" Combs sex-trafficking trial argues that the mixed verdict demonstrates the legal system's inability to adequately address the complexities of domestic violence and coercive control. The article suggests that prosecutors resorted to trafficking charges because existing domestic violence statutes are often ill-equipped to handle cases involving wealthy, powerful abusers. While Combs was found guilty of lesser charges, his acquittal on the most serious counts is presented as a failure of justice. The author contends that without better legal frameworks, powerful abusers will continue to evade full accountability.</p>

While this has saved millions of lives, heart disease remains a leading killer, with rising rates of obesity and diabetes posing new challenges.
