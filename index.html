            <p>A U.S. man, identified as Akinyela Taylor, hijacked a small plane in Belize, stabbing two passengers and the pilot. Fortunately, one of the passengers, licensed to carry a firearm, fatally shot the hijacker, preventing a potential mass casualty event. The incident occurred on a Cessna Caravan flight from Corozal to San Pedro, carrying 14 passengers and 2 crew members. Authorities are investigating the motive behind the hijacking, with U.S. officials working alongside Belizean authorities to determine the full circumstances.</p>

            <p>Premier League shirt sponsorships are increasingly driven by globalization and technology, with companies seeking access to a worldwide marketplace. Economic shifts have seen sponsors from countries with previously booming economies, like Japan, become less common, while newer money from financial strongholds such as the Middle East is on the rise. Sponsorship deals offer companies access to private boxes, photoshoots with players, and potential political leverage. A sports management expert suggests the Premier League should prioritize connecting with local communities alongside economic sustainability.</p>

            <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors digested Japan's inflation data, which showed a 3.6% year-on-year increase in March, exceeding the Bank of Japan's target for the third consecutive year.

Shipping stocks in South Korea and Japan increased following the reimplementation of fees on ships built in China, a policy originally enacted by the Trump administration.

            <p>A coroner in Lancashire, UK, is advocating for mandatory eye tests for older drivers after inquests into four fatal accidents revealed the drivers had failing eyesight and repeatedly failed to declare their visual impairments to the DVLA. The coroner labeled the UK's licensing system the "laxest in Europe," as it relies on self-reporting of visual conditions and lacks mandatory visual checks for drivers up to age 70. Families of the victims expressed their grief and frustration, highlighting the avoidable nature of the tragedies. The Department for Transport stated it would consider the coroner's report and is committed to improving road safety.</p>

            <p>A recent earthquake in Myanmar may have disrupted the production of rare earth minerals, a critical component in various technologies, which are normally sold to China. Myanmar is China's largest foreign supplier of these elements, and the earthquake could have damaged mining equipment, affected mine safety, and blocked transport routes. Analysts suggest this disruption could exacerbate price volatility and force China to diversify its rare earth sources. China dominates the rare earth market, controlling nearly 90% of global processing capacity, but relies heavily on imports from Myanmar.</p>

            <p>New research suggests that the brown rat may have been domesticated in China as early as the Ming Dynasty and spread around the world via the treasure ship fleets of explorer Zheng He. Ancient silk paintings provide evidence of domesticated brown rats with coat color variations in China during AD1425–1435. Researchers believe that these domesticated rats may have stowed away on Zheng He's ships, which traveled extensively across the globe, leading to the widespread distribution of the species.</p>

Despite a federal judge's order, Ábrego García remains in El Salvador's custody, with President Bukele refusing to release him. The White House alleges Ábrego García is an MS-13 gang member, which his lawyers deny. The senator's visit occurred amid a legal showdown between the US president and the courts on immigration, with the Supreme Court partially upholding a lower court ruling to "facilitate" Mr. Ábrego García's release.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive Social Security records, citing privacy concerns. The judge stated that granting DOGE unlimited access to personally identifiable information would betray the government's commitment to citizens. The order restricts DOGE members from accessing records containing personal information and from installing software on SSA computer systems. DOGE can access specific data with written permission, but the ruling aims to protect the privacy of individuals' sensitive information.</p>
