          <p>A Chicago-area man from Mexico, who has a pending U visa, has been in ICE custody for months after he and his wife allegedly made a wrong turn near the U.S.-Canada border in Michigan. His wife, a U.S. citizen, claims she was also detained for three days following the incident. Community members and civil rights activists are rallying for his release, arguing that his detention is unjust as he has deferred action status protecting him from deportation. His attorney calls the situation one of the most egregious cases he has ever encountered.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted alongside his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents, appeared for a parole hearing after serving nearly 30 years of a life sentence. The hearing was made possible by California's youth offender law, as the brothers were under 26 at the time of the crime. They have long maintained they acted in self-defense against years of abuse, a claim the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office disputes, opposing their release. The parole board will determine if Menendez still poses a public safety risk, with Governor Gavin Newsom having the final say on any recommendation for release.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has strongly criticized former President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate mail-in voting through an executive order, stating that Trump cannot unilaterally change the Constitution. Shapiro emphasized that states hold the authority to set their own election rules and that Pennsylvania's mail-in voting system was established with bipartisan support. He accused Trump of spreading misinformation to stoke division and assured that any such executive order would have no legal bearing on elections in his state. The governor affirmed his commitment to supporting county officials in administering mail-in voting.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 44% of American adults are ordering kids' meals at restaurants, a trend driven by a desire for smaller portions and lower prices amid economic pressures. This shift in consumer behavior comes as some major fast-food chains report slowing sales, particularly among low-income customers. Diners are finding that the simpler, less expensive options on children's menus offer a practical way to manage their budgets without giving up on eating out entirely. The article highlights that this choice is becoming a smart financial decision for many, not just a nostalgic one.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly increased by 2% in July, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June, when these purchase contracts were likely initiated. Housing inventory also grew to its highest level since May 2020, helping to moderate price growth, with the median home price seeing only a slight 0.2% year-over-year increase.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock value dropped by approximately 10% after the company unveiled a new, simplified logo as part of a broader brand revitalization effort. The redesign, which removes the iconic image of a man in a rocking chair and the phrase "old country store," has drawn significant criticism on social media. Some conservative commentators, including Donald Trump Jr., suggested the change was a move away from the brand's traditional American identity. The negative reaction highlights the risks companies face when updating beloved branding, as customers also complained about recent interior remodels feeling too sterile.</p>

He suggested that inflation is currently closer to 3% and that the central bank still has work to do, despite aggressive pressure from the White House for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a taxable account for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, effectively postponing the tax bill until the ETF shares are sold. While this allows for rebalancing without immediate tax consequences, the process has strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, often starting at $1 million. Financial advisors caution that investors must be content with the new ETF, as exit options can be limited. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, which covered over 500 species, noted that birds with larger eyes, like the American Robin, were most affected.

          <p>The United Kingdom received a record 111,000 asylum applications in the year ending in June, marking a 14% increase from the previous year. Despite the record number of new claims, Home Office figures show that officials are processing cases at a faster rate, reducing the overall backlog of initial decisions to 71,000 cases, down from a peak of 134,000 a year prior. The Labour government, which has pledged to clear the backlog by 2029, faces ongoing pressure over immigration as the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has seen a slight increase.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Stephen Miller's Immigration Focus May Be Hindering Trump's Broader Agenda</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article suggests that Stephen Miller's intense focus on mass deportations, while perceived as a core part of the Trump administration's authoritarian push, may actually be counterproductive to that goal. The author argues that the militarized immigration enforcement in cities like Washington, D.C., creates the appearance of a police state without effectively suppressing dissent, instead galvanizing protests and alienating voters. Miller's single-minded pursuit of deportations is framed as a personal obsession that prioritizes cruelty over the strategic consolidation of power, making the administration's actions more openly thuggish and less insidiously effective.</p>

          <p>As ESPN launched its new direct-to-consumer streaming service, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the company will not report subscriber numbers, calling the metric "irrelevant." Instead, Disney will focus on overall revenue and profits for its Sports division, taking an "agnostic" approach to whether viewers watch via cable or the new app. This strategy mirrors moves by Netflix and Apple, aiming to prevent investor fixation on a single metric that can be volatile. The focus remains on monetizing the ESPN brand through advertising and features like sports betting, regardless of the platform used. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retailer WH Smith saw its market value plummet by nearly £600 million after revealing a £30 million accounting error in its North American division, forcing it to cut profit forecasts. The company stated the mistake was primarily due to recognizing income from supplier arrangements too early and has launched an independent review by Deloitte. The error reduces the expected profits from its North American business from £55 million to £25 million. This news has severely damaged investor confidence, drawing comparisons to a previous accounting scandal at Tesco and tarnishing the company's recent efforts to refocus on its travel retail operations.</p>

          <p>A record number of students aged 17 and older in the UK are resitting their GCSE Maths and English exams, with nearly a quarter of this year's entries coming from this group. Pass rates for these resits are significantly lower, leading educationalists to warn of a "resit crisis" where students are trapped in a demoralizing cycle of failure. Experts suggest the current GCSE curriculum may be too demanding and that the problem is rooted in foundational skills not being adequately taught in earlier school years. This situation places a heavy logistical and financial strain on colleges that facilitate the majority of these resits.</p>

The government will cover wages and costs while a buyer is sought for the nationally important steel manufacturer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While reverse mortgages can provide a cash flow for seniors by tapping into home equity, they come with significant disadvantages that homeowners should carefully consider. These loans involve high upfront fees, closing costs, and compounding interest, which can rapidly deplete a home's equity over time. Borrowers also risk foreclosure if they fail to pay for property taxes, insurance, and home maintenance. Furthermore, the growing loan balance reduces the inheritance left to heirs, potentially leaving them with substantial debt to settle or forcing the sale of the family home.
