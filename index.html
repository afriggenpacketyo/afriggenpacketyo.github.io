          <p>Authorities are investigating a reported break-in at the Minnesota home of slain state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were fatally shot earlier in the week. The home, which had been boarded up after the initial investigation, showed signs of forced entry through a rear window. While crime scene investigators conducted another search, family members reported nothing appeared to be missing. The suspect in the Hortmans' killing, Vance Boelter, remains in custody facing federal and state murder charges after a large-scale manhunt. This incident has heightened security concerns for state lawmakers. The tone of this article is somber and focused on the details of the crime. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Social Security Board of Trustees indicates that the trust fund supporting Social Security retirement benefits may be depleted by 2033. This projection remains unchanged from the previous year's forecast, though the combined trust funds may be insolvent by 2034, one year earlier than previously estimated. The report emphasizes the importance of addressing the looming funding shortfall, as approximately 70 million people currently receive Social Security benefits, while 185 million contribute through payroll taxes.

          <p>The Social Security retirement trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously anticipated, according to the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report. This acceleration is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. If the trust fund is depleted, beneficiaries could face a 19% reduction in their monthly payments. The report highlights the need for Congress to act swiftly to address the program's financial challenges, especially as Americans are filing for benefits at a record rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK House of Commons voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, marking a significant change in reproductive rights. MPs were given a "conscience vote" or "free vote," allowing them to follow their instincts on this and the issue of assisted dying. This unusual situation sees loyal cabinet ministers voting on opposite sides. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has largely stayed out of these debates to avoid influencing his colleagues, though his support for both policies is known. The article conveys a tone of political peculiarity and individual autonomy. </p>

          <h2>Potential Monthly Payout from a $500,000 Annuity at Age 65</h2>

          <p>Investing $500,000 in an annuity at age 65 could yield substantial retirement income, influenced by factors like gender, annuity type, and prevailing interest rates. An immediate fixed annuity could generate approximately $3,269 per month for a 65-year-old male and $3,151 for a female. Joint life annuities offer around $2,863 per month, with payments continuing as long as either person is alive. The interest rate environment, type of annuity, payout features, and inflation protection all play a role in determining the payout. (not investment advice)</p>
