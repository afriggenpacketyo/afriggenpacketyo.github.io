          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng met in Geneva for trade talks, marking the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing. Both sides described the talks as productive and constructive, signaling substantial progress in de-escalating the trade war, which has caused turmoil in financial markets and raised fears of a global recession. Following the meetings, US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said the deal struck with China would help reduce the US's $1.2tn trade deficit. The World Trade Organization inspector general called the talks a significant step forward, urging both nations to continue developing solutions to mitigate tensions and strengthen confidence in the multilateral trading system.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly in discussions with Qatar regarding the potential transfer of a luxury jumbo jet for use as Air Force One, with Qatar possibly offering a version of a Boeing 747-8. While Qatar denies that the plane would be a gift, they acknowledge discussions about the transfer of an aircraft for "temporary use" between the two countries. The plane would need to be retrofitted and cleared by security officials before use. President Trump defended the negotiations, referring to the plane as a gift offered for his use at no cost, and said it would replace the 40-year-old Air Force One temporarily. Critics are sure to raise legal and ethical questions among critics. The current Air Force One planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has discovered documentation associated with the Nazi regime among its archives, including propaganda material used to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The material was found while preparing for the creation of a museum with historical documents. The documents include postcards, photographs, and propaganda believed to be related to the arrival of 83 packages sent by the German embassy in Tokyo aboard a Japanese steamship in 1941. The president of the Supreme Court has ordered the preservation of the material and a thorough analysis. Argentina is home to the largest Jewish population in Latin America and was a destination for many Nazis after the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower drug costs, a proposal he tried unsuccessfully to implement during his first term. The order would likely impact drugs covered by Medicare Part B, such as infusions for cancer, and faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it will hurt innovation.

          <p>Chinese economist Yao Yang discusses the current state and outlook for the US-China trade war, suggesting that a deal is likely due to the unsustainability of the tariffs. He notes growing recognition in the US that the trade war is harmful, citing weak economic data and instability in the dollar. Yao suggests a rollback to the original 34 percent tariff level is possible and that the US may demand China buy more American goods. He emphasizes that both sides are realizing the current path hurts everyone and that negotiation is the ultimate goal.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, known for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, faces strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population, becoming entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that turning the system into a political issue could undermine its stability and public trust. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government aims to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but plans to increase the burden on high medical cost patients sparked backlash. The government ultimately froze all envisioned hikes following talks with patient advocates, pushing the deadline for a new plan to after the upper house election.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in talks with the Qatari government about accepting a luxury Boeing 747 airplane that could temporarily serve as Air Force One. The offer comes ahead of Trump's visit to the Middle East. The plane would be donated to Trump's presidential library when he leaves office, raising legal and ethical questions. Trump pushed back against concerns, stating the Defense Department is getting a free gift. Democrats questioned the legality of the deal, with Senator Chris Murphy calling it a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, causing widespread delays on Sunday. The FAA said the outage involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop. The incident has resulted in more than 200 delays and at least 80 cancellations, impacting domestic and international flights. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says a fix is on the way, but the number of flights will be cut in the coming weeks. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for the FAA to prioritize fixing the situation at Newark Liberty before problems spread elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns over the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made the decision, citing the need to protect the nation's food supply and animals. The New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into the flesh and blood of animals. The U.S. and Mexico had previously eradicated the New World screwworm in the 1960s and '70s, but cases have resurged in parts of Central America and Mexico. The new ban will continue on a month-by-month basis until containment is achieved.</p>

          <p>President Trump will sign an executive order aimed at lowering some drug prices in the United States by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal is what he calls a ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù pricing model. The plan will most likely be subject to challenges in court, and it is not clear whether it will pass legal muster, especially without action by Congress. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks. Companies have warned that such a policy would lead them to spend less on research, depriving patients of new medicines.</p>

They found postcards, photographs and propaganda material from the Nazi regime, as well as thousands of notebooks belonging to the Nazi party.

Despite research showing Zepbound results in more weight loss, Caremark excluded it to lower drug prices for employers, blocking patients from accessing the more effective treatment. Patients like Ellen Davis, who have experienced significant health improvements on Zepbound, are being forced to switch to a less effective medication. Experts argue both drugs should remain available due to varying patient responses, but PBMs often prioritize cost savings over individual patient needs.</p>
