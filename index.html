          <p>Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, a potential candidate to lead the institution under Donald Trump, has called for a "regime change" in the Fed's policy conduct. He criticized the current leadership for their hesitation to cut rates, aligning with Trump's public pressure on the central bank. Warsh also proposed a new accord between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to coordinate on managing the national debt and the Fed's balance sheet, similar to the 1951 agreement. This approach aims to align monetary policy with fiscal objectives, a significant departure from the Fed's traditional operational independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for Donald Trump, for a judgeship on the U.S. Court of Appeals. The vote proceeded along party lines after a chaotic meeting where Democrats walked out in protest, citing Chairman Chuck Grassley's refusal to allow a whistleblower to testify against Bove. Bove's nomination has faced significant opposition due to allegations of unethical conduct and poor temperament, including claims he suggested defying court orders. His confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain amid the controversy.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that first-generation migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than native-born workers. Researchers found this disparity is not due to unequal pay for the same job but rather to structural barriers limiting migrant access to higher-paying industries and roles. The wage gap narrows to 7.7% for second-generation migrants, which is still higher than the international average, indicating slower integration compared to countries like Canada. The report recommends improved language support and recognition of foreign qualifications to address these structural issues.</p>

          <p>Former chairs of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) are raising alarms over President Trump's executive orders aimed at quadrupling U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The orders seek to overhaul the NRC, slashing regulations and expediting plant approvals, which critics argue threatens the regulator's independence and could increase safety risks. Citing the 2011 Fukushima disaster as an example of regulatory failure, the former officials warn that political interference could compromise public safety. The administration contends the changes are necessary to overcome bureaucratic "risk aversion" and meet growing energy demands.</p>

          <p>James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, was barred from attending a graduation ceremony for a CIA bomb-sniffing dog he had sponsored and named after his late wife. The decision was reportedly based on a presidential executive order stripping security clearances from Clapper and other former officials who criticized Donald Trump. The incident is being viewed as an example of the administration's use of executive power for personal retribution against perceived "deep state" adversaries. Although the event was not classified, CIA officials interpreted the order as a complete ban from agency property for Clapper.</p>

          <p>China has sent a "mini-brain" on a chip to its Tiangong space station to investigate the effects of microgravity on the human brain. The experiment, launched aboard the Tianzhou-9 cargo craft, contains living human brain cells, immune cells, and capillary-like vessels on a credit-card-sized chip. This marks the first time such a highly integrated brain model with a blood-brain barrier has been studied in space. Researchers hope the findings will help develop preventative measures for cognitive issues experienced by astronauts during long-duration missions and advance neuroscience research.</p>

          <p>Iran has intensified its mass deportation of Afghan migrants, expelling hundreds of thousands in recent months and separating thousands of children from their parents. The regime is justifying the crackdown with unsubstantiated claims that Afghans assisted Israel during a recent conflict, a pretext widely seen as cynical. This policy targets a community that has been part of Iranian society for decades but has long faced discrimination and lacked a path to citizenship. The deportations are particularly harsh for women and girls who now face the Taliban's oppressive rule in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was reportedly informed of her dismissal through a memo citing the president's authority under Article 2 of the Constitution. Comey was a prominent prosecutor who helped lead the cases against Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her termination follows her father's own firing by Donald Trump in 2017 and is seen by some as part of a pattern of politically motivated actions within the Justice Department.</p>

The company's U.S. products switched to HFCS in the 1980s due to farming subsidies and sugar tariffs, a move that would be costly to reverse under current trade policies.</p>

With services enhancing their digital security, attackers are now turning to kidnapping and coercion to access individuals' private wallets.
