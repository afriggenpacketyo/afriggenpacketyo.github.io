          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers visited Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two foreign students detained by ICE for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. The lawmakers expressed concerns about the students' detention and accused the Trump administration of attempting to suppress free speech. Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, was denied release to attend the birth of his child, while Öztürk, a Tufts University student, is facing deportation proceedings.

          <p>Lori Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, has been found guilty of conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. The prosecution argued that Daybell orchestrated the shooting to obtain his life insurance and be with Chad Daybell, invoking twisted religious beliefs to justify the act. Evidence included text messages discussing the life insurance policy and references to religious figures to justify the killing. This conviction adds to Daybell's life sentence for the deaths of her children, further solidifying her reputation as the "doomsday mom."</p>

          <h2>Trump Signals Potential Reduction in China Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 18:58:27 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that high tariffs on goods from China would "come down substantially," but not to zero, during a White House news conference. This statement followed comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting the unsustainability of the current high tariffs. Trump's high tariffs have caused market instability and increased interest rates, prompting concerns about economic growth. Despite the tariffs, Trump expressed a desire for a positive relationship with China and President Xi Jinping, suggesting a potential shift in trade policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order preventing the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that migrants were in imminent danger of deportation to a prison in El Salvador. The judge ordered that individuals subject to deportation under the AEA must receive 21 days' notice, be informed of their right to judicial review, and consult with an attorney. This ruling follows the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport noncitizens deemed "dangerous."</p>

          <p>Tesla's profit plunged 71% in the first quarter, attributed to factors including tariffs and brand issues linked to Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. The company faced declining automotive sales and increased competition, leading to a drop in revenue. Analysts have pointed to Musk's deteriorating reputation and the impact of tariffs as significant challenges. Tesla's share price has been volatile, and investors are urging Musk to prioritize Tesla over his government role. The company also faces potential disruptions to its Cybercab plans due to halted imports from China.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio unveiled a plan to restructure the State Department, aiming to reduce bureaucracy and align the department with America's national interests.
