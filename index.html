          <p>In a New York Times opinion piece, Ben Rhodes argues that the United States is increasingly resembling a country where political power is used for personal gain, similar to what has occurred in Russia under Vladimir Putin and Hungary under Viktor Orban. Rhodes points to President Trump's increased personal wealth since beginning his 2024 campaign, billions of foreign dollars flowing into his family's ventures, and gifts from foreign governments as evidence. He warns that the fusion of political and personal interests erodes the checks and balances of the American system, leading to a decline in moral and ethical standards and the enrichment of oligarchs at the expense of the people. The author fears that the US is becoming just another country with a corrupt strongman personalizing and profiting from power.</p>

          <p>Rwanda has announced its withdrawal from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) due to ongoing tensions with the Democratic Republic of Congo. The decision follows Rwanda being blocked from assuming the rotating presidency of the bloc, which Rwanda claims is due to Congo's instrumentalization of the bloc against them. The DRC accuses Rwanda of supporting the M23 armed group, which has seized territory in eastern Congo, leading to broader conflict between the two nations. Rwanda has condemned the decision as violating its rights and undermining the principles of the organization.</p>

          <p>A report by the Youth Sport Trust (YST) reveals a significant decline in the number of hours secondary school pupils in England spend on physical education (PE). The YST describes this decline as troubling, noting that nearly 4,000 PE hours have been lost in the last year alone. The organization also claims that almost 45,000 PE hours have disappeared from secondary school timetables since the 2012 London Olympics, with a corresponding 7% drop in the number of PE teachers. The government has responded by stating its commitment to breaking down barriers to accessing PE and school sports for young people.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced an £86 billion package for the science and technology sector as part of its upcoming Spending Review. The funding will support research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries, with up to £500 million allocated to regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to direct investment based on their areas' expertise. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that this investment would create jobs and enhance security, with the package expected to be worth over £22.5 billion annually by 2029. While research backers have welcomed the funding, they also emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers and address potential challenges such as visa costs for overseas scientists and budget adjustments for inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after being ingested. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics alter gut metabolism and damage the gut barrier in mice. This could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. The study highlights the increased oral exposure to PLA microplastics due to their widespread use in food packaging and disposable tableware.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating at the Floga archaeological site on the Greek island of Paros have discovered an ancient workshop filled with unfinished sculptures and other artifacts. The excavation revealed new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, indicating continuous use of the site over time. Among the finds were semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. The site, reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., served as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, evidenced by a room with a pebble floor and wall paintings imitating marble slabs.</p>

          <p>Jermain Charlo, a Montana mom, went missing in June 2018, and her family immediately suspected foul play when her social media activity ceased. The Missoula Police Department and other agencies have been investigating her disappearance for six years. Charlo was last seen at The Badlander bar in Missoula, Montana, with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, who provided conflicting accounts of dropping her off. Cellphone data indicated Charlo's phone was near DeFrance's residence after she disappeared, and DeFrance later admitted to discarding the phone in Idaho, though it was never recovered. DeFrance has not been named a suspect, and the case remains unsolved despite extensive searches and investigations.</p>

His comments came after the USA's 2-1 loss to Turkey in a friendly match, where he fielded a younger and less-experienced squad.

While the government faces challenges such as industrial energy prices and social care costs, it aims to prioritize investment in science-led growth and infrastructure projects like the high-speed rail line between Liverpool and Manchester, while maintaining tight controls on day-to-day spending.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on easing citizenship laws, which has polarized the country. The referendum proposes halving the required residency period for citizenship from 10 to 5 years, aligning Italy with most other European nations. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, from the hard-right, opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open." Supporters of the referendum argue that it would integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to Italian society, while opponents claim it would dilute Italian identity. The referendum requires a 50% voter turnout to be valid.</p>

          <p>Iranian rapper Tataloo, once a supporter of a hard-line presidential candidate, is now facing execution after being convicted of “insulting Islamic sanctities.” Tataloo's music, which challenged Iran's theocracy, gained popularity among the country's youth, especially after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. Despite past support for the Revolutionary Guard and hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi, Tataloo's lyrics became increasingly critical of the authorities, leading to his arrest upon returning to Iran in 2023. Activists have protested his death sentence, expressing concerns for his safety, especially after a reported suicide attempt in prison.</p>

The government is attempting to improve flexible options as part of its pledge to recruit 6,500 new teachers, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson advocating for more schools to offer flexible hours.

Tisdall warns that this path leads to the normalization of nuclear warfare and increases the likelihood of tactical nuclear weapons being deployed.

          <h2>Trump's National Guard Deployment to L.A. Raises Legal Questions</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles has raised legal concerns, with Gov. Gavin Newsom opposing the move. President Trump is activating the Guard under Title 10, a provision rarely invoked, to protect ICE personnel and federal facilities. Critics, including Erwin Chemerinsky, argue this action is an abuse of power and an attempt to suppress dissent, while others fear Trump might invoke the Insurrection Act. The ACLU has condemned the deployment, citing legal and ethical concerns about using the military to police civilians.</p>

          <h2>China's Demographic Crisis Could Ease with Male Childcare Subsidies, Research Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing a demographic crisis. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. The study emphasizes the need to address traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, which clash with rapid economic changes and contribute to declining fertility rates.</p>
