          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a threat to Afghanistan, currently governed by the Taliban, demanding the return of the strategic Bagram Air Base to US control. Trump, who did not specify consequences, stated that "BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!" if the base is not returned "right away." He justified the demand by noting the base's proximity to China's nuclear weapons facilities and criticized the Biden administration's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. This article highlights Trump's assertive foreign policy stance and his continued focus on the base's strategic importance.</p>

          <p>More than a decade after the murder of 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru in Kenya, allegedly by a British soldier, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a UK national. This potential extradition would mark a significant precedent for a British soldier facing trial abroad for a civilian murder. This article details the night Wanjiru went missing in 2012, her body found months later in a septic tank, and the long struggle for justice. Allegations of a cover-up within the British Army and continued transactional sex by soldiers at the Nanyuki base underscore systemic issues.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla is reportedly set to become the first female CEO of Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, with an official announcement expected soon. Palla, 52, who previously led the company's regional subsidiary, will replace Richard Lutz, who was dismissed last month. Her appointment comes as Deutsche Bahn faces widespread delays and cancellations, with the company paying significant compensation in 2024 due to infrastructure issues. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to restructure the company and modernize Germany's transport infrastructure, making Palla's leadership crucial for addressing these challenges.</p>

          <p>Several European airports, including Heathrow, experienced widespread delays due to a cyber-attack targeting an electronic check-in and baggage system provided by Collins Aerospace. The "technical issue" forced manual check-in operations, causing long queues and missed connections for hundreds of passengers. While British Airways used a backup system, most other airlines at Heathrow were affected, with Brussels Airport canceling half its flights. This article highlights the vulnerability of aviation systems to cyber threats, prompting investigations by national cybersecurity centers and the European Commission to understand the attack's impact and restore operations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its conflict with "sanctuary states" by threatening legal action and federal funding cuts if California, New York, and Illinois refuse to honor ICE immigration detainers. These detainers are requests for local authorities to hold individuals for federal agents, which states argue are voluntary and can lead to liability for erroneous detentions. The Trump administration asserts that these policies obstruct immigration enforcement and release "criminal aliens" into communities. This article highlights a deep federal-state divide over immigration policy, with states citing constitutional concerns and potential legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle is forecast to strengthen into the second Atlantic hurricane of the season as soon as Saturday night, with sustained winds potentially reaching Category 2 intensity. Currently moving northwest in the Atlantic, Gabrielle is expected to pass east of Bermuda, which may experience swells and increased easterly winds, though a direct hit is unlikely. The storm is then projected to curve northeast towards the Azores, missing the U.S. mainland. This development is nearly a month later than the average for the second hurricane of the season, which typically forms around late August.</p>

Wealthier Chinese families are particularly keen to spend on luxury items, fine dining, and unique cultural activities.

While the team remains optimistic about a quick recovery, his absence is a blow to the middle of their batting order.

Maintenance loans often fall significantly short of covering living costs, leaving students like Tianna Hunkins working up to 30 hours a week and wearing uniforms to lectures. Research indicates that the maximum annual loan covers only half the costs for freshers, leading to sacrifices in academic opportunities and social life. Universities are observing these trends, with some exploring changes to support students, while calls are made for the government to reintroduce maintenance grants and increase loan thresholds.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including top CIA deputies and congressional staffers, without prior White House notification. This action caused consternation among Trump's advisers, who viewed it as a blunder and an example of deepening animosity between Gabbard and the CIA. Gabbard's office claimed the individuals were involved in "politicization or weaponization of intelligence," aligning with Trump's agenda to address perceived flaws in intelligence assessments. The incident underscores ongoing tensions within the intelligence community and concerns over potential political motivations behind such high-level personnel decisions.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a deal for TikTok's US operations, which would give US companies control over the app's algorithm and allocate six of seven board seats to Americans. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt anticipates the deal could be signed within days, though Beijing has not yet confirmed. Tech giant Oracle, owned by Trump ally Larry Ellison, is set to lead data and privacy for the app in the US. This agreement follows repeated delays in a potential TikTok ban and aims to address national security concerns, while also allowing the popular platform to continue operating in the US.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law prohibiting law enforcement officers from wearing masks on duty, with exceptions for riot gear, medical masks, and undercover work. Newsom, a vocal critic of President Trump, framed the "No Secret Police Act" as a stand against authoritarianism and a response to increased, often masked, federal immigration enforcement. While the law applies to local agencies, its enforceability against federal officers remains uncertain and could lead to legal challenges regarding state versus federal powers. The measure aims to increase transparency and accountability, but law enforcement groups have opposed it, citing officer safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is discontinuing the U.S. Department of Agriculture's annual Household Food Security Report, deeming it "overly politicized" and "rife with inaccuracies." This decision follows legislation signed by President Trump that significantly reduced food aid to the poor, potentially affecting millions. Critics accuse the administration of deliberately hindering the measurement of hunger to obscure the impact of its policies, drawing parallels to non-democracies manipulating data. The USDA claims the report's subjective questions don't accurately reflect current conditions, citing lower poverty rates and job growth.</p>

          <p>Efforts to break the impasse in trilateral nuclear arms control talks involving the US, Russia, and China face significant challenges, particularly regarding the extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). President Trump's push for China's involvement was met with a firm refusal from Beijing, which maintains a "no first use" policy and a nuclear strategy rooted in self-defense. China's foreign ministry spokesman called the proposal "neither reasonable nor realistic," underscoring the difficulties in achieving a new agreement. This situation fuels fears of a renewed nuclear arms race, highlighting global instability in strategic defense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applicants, a move set to significantly impact the technology and finance sectors. This fee applies only to new visas and not renewals or current holders, with White House officials clarifying it is a one-time charge. The decision has prompted major tech companies like Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Microsoft to advise H-1B visa holders to avoid international travel and return to the U.S. promptly. While the administration frames it as protecting American workers, foreign governments and immigration advocates express concern over potential disruptions and humanitarian consequences.
