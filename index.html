            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen visited El Salvador to investigate the wrongful deportation of Maryland migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration has acknowledged was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison. Van Hollen met with American Embassy members and human rights groups, seeking answers about the deportation. He stated that the government of El Salvador could not provide evidence that Abrego Garcia was involved in MS-13, disputing President Trump's claims. Van Hollen emphasized his commitment to fighting MS-13 while upholding due process for all individuals.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced new NIH studies to investigate environmental factors contributing to rising autism rates, following a CDC report showing increased diagnoses. Kennedy challenged the notion that better diagnoses fully explain the increase, emphasizing the need to address environmental exposures like mold and pesticides. Experts acknowledge the role of environmental factors but also highlight the impact of broadened diagnostic criteria and genetic predisposition. Kennedy pledged to follow the science regardless of current expectations, while autism organizations expressed concern over linking autism to environmental toxins without scientific evidence.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old man deported from Maryland to El Salvador, is at the center of a legal battle. The Trump administration claims his deportation was an 'administrative error' but alleges ties to the MS-13 gang, a claim disputed by a Maryland judge. The judge is demanding daily updates from the government on steps to bring him back to the US. Ábrego García had been granted protection from deportation in 2019 due to potential persecution in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals a decline in church attendance and religious affiliation among Americans, while belief in God remains relatively stable. The research indicates a shift towards individualized spirituality, with people stepping away from religious institutions but maintaining personal faith practices like prayer and meditation. Political values, particularly regarding same-sex marriage and gender roles, are cited as a major reason for leaving organized religion. Researchers argue this trend represents a transformation in how people practice faith, moving towards personal expressions of spirituality rather than formal institutions.</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, a small stationery business owner in Florida, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the impact of tariffs on her business. Ley argues that the tariffs, imposed on goods imported from China, are illegal because they bypassed Congressional approval. She says her business cannot survive the short-term pain caused by the tariffs, which have already cost her company nearly $1.2 million. The White House maintains that the president has broad authority to impose tariffs to address national emergencies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A scheme to support GPs to provide care and advice to patients which avoids them joining long NHS hospital waiting lists is being expanded in England, the government says. GPs will work more closely with specialists to access expert advice quickly for patients with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, menopause symptoms and ear infections. Backed by £80m of funding, its ambition is to help two million people receive faster and more convenient care in their local community by the end of 2025/26. Health minister Karen Smyth said the scheme would "save time and stop masses of people having to head to hospital for unnecessary appointments".</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison. The judge accused the administration of 'deliberately flouting' his orders and warned of potential criminal charges. The case centers on the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members to El Salvador. Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to 'purge' its alleged contempt by taking the migrants back into U.S. custody.</p>

Other comedians believe that those in the public eye will always be fair game, and that sometimes it's necessary to overstep the mark to make comedy funny.</p>
