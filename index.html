          <h2>Study Reveals Ancient Roses Were Likely Yellow</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese and Dutch researchers has found that the original roses were likely yellow, not red as commonly believed. The research involved an evolutionary genetic analysis of domesticated and wild rose samples. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' are a symbol of love and beauty worldwide. The study indicated that the common ancestor of roses had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets, challenging the modern perception of roses.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a more assertive stance, according to this New York Times article. General Munir's tough rhetoric, including describing Kashmir as Pakistan's 'jugular vein,' reflects his hard-line views shaped by his intelligence background and belief in the religious nature of the conflict. Analysts suggest his actions aim to project strength amidst Pakistan's internal strife, while India views his comments as a concerning shift in Pakistan's approach. The United States and the United Nations have urged de-escalation as diplomatic relations between the two countries remain frozen.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns that the American movie industry is in decline. Trump claims that other countries are offering incentives to attract filmmakers, which he views as a 'National Security threat' due to its impact on messaging and propaganda. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has responded, saying 'We're on it'. The move's specifics remain unclear, particularly regarding American production companies filming abroad. Trump has appointed film stars to promote business opportunities in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Three Bulgarians, recently convicted of spying for Russia, attended a Brexit debate in the Palace of Westminster in May 2016. Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzhambazov, and Katrin Ivanova were photographed at the event, which was sponsored by a former MP. The spies, directed by Jan Marsalek, conducted surveillance across Europe targeting enemies of Vladimir Putin's regime. Roussev, the cell's leader, had close ties with Marsalek and was involved in financial irregularities before his espionage activities. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of either the event's organisers or attendees.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming the third position. The United States remained the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with the sharp increases seen in previous years due to resumed development projects after the pandemic. Despite the drop, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool for promoting a 'free and open' Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence.</p>

          <h2>Japan Faces Trash Disposal Issues for Tourists</h2>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations, is a major frustration for visitors to Japan. Many tourists reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins in Japan is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks. Despite the inconvenience, littering in tourist spots remains a concern. CEO of Forcetec Inc., Yohei Takemura, said popular tourist destinations like New York and Paris each have about 30,000 public trash bins.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly invoked the Constitution and said it is what "binds us all together" after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. Pence received the award for his refusal to go along with President Donald Trump’s efforts to remain in office after losing the 2020 election. He never mentioned Trump during his 10-minute speech but made several references to the Trump administration. He acknowledged that he probably had differences with the Democrats in the room but also with his own Republican Party.</p>

          <p>As U.S. tariffs reduce orders for Chinese goods, China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market, a move that threatens to drive the world's second-largest economy into deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting efforts to redirect products to the domestic market for sale. JD.com, Tencent, and Douyin are among the e-commerce giants promoting sales of these goods to Chinese consumers. The side effect is a ferocious price war among Chinese firms.</p>

          <p>Silent book clubs are growing in popularity, offering a chance to unplug and read in a social setting. Unlike traditional book clubs, readers can bring any book they want and read in silence for an hour, followed by a discussion. The original Silent Book Club was founded in San Francisco in 2012 and now has over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries. The number of silent book clubs being organized in the UK in the beginning of 2025 increased by 460%, compared to the same period in 2024.</p>

          <p>Experts are discussing the potential for AI to exacerbate inequality in the workplace, with some suggesting companies have a responsibility to protect jobs and equip employees with new skills. Others argue that protecting employment might not be the right mindset, and adaptation is key. There are concerns about AI's impact on jobs and the application of ethics in AI. Experts agree that AI's unintended consequences also need to be addressed.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to "intensify and expand" its operations in Gaza. The IDF said it was "increasing the pressure" with the aim of returning hostages held in Gaza and defeating Hamas militants. Critics say the recent military offensive, after a ceasefire broke down, has failed to guarantee the release of captives, and question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives in the conflict. Under the plan, the military said it would operate in new areas and "destroy all infrastructure" above and below ground.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would impose a 100 percent tariff on movies “produced” outside the United States, proclaiming that the issue posed a national security threat. Trump said he had authorized the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of taxing “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” The Motion Picture Association declined to comment. As is often is the case with Trump’s declarations on social media, it was not entirely clear what he was talking about.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 100% tariff on films made outside of the US, claiming the country's movie industry was "dying a very fast death". He complained that other countries were "offering all sorts of incentives to draw" filmmakers and film studios away from the United States. The president said this was a "concerted effort by other nations and, therefore, a national security threat". It is unclear how the tariff would affect international productions, such as the upcoming Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, which is filmed in the US as well as other countries around the world.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper proved costly in the Dodgers' 4-3 loss to the Braves, with Austin Riley hitting two home runs off the pitch. Despite May's overall solid performance, these mistakes highlight the importance of consistently landing his sweeper. The Dodgers made a late comeback attempt, but ultimately fell short. May's recent regression, with 14 runs allowed in his last three outings, has been a disappointment for the team.</p>

He believed his comments merely indicated he was motivated as ever to perform on track. Hamilton finished eighth in the race which was won in dominant style by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri. During the race Hamilton asked Ferrari to have his teammate Charles Leclerc, who was in front, switch places with him as the British driver was clearly quicker.</p>

He said that "for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders". The reopening of Alcatraz would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," he said. In March, he sent a group of more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador.</p>
