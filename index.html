          <p>Actress Julia Roberts recently shared that she felt surprisingly intimidated and scared before her first meeting with fellow actress and "After the Hunt" co-star Chloë Sevigny. Roberts recounted the moment during a group interview, explaining that the anticipation of Sevigny's arrival at her home for a rehearsal caused both her and co-star Ayo Edebiri to admit their nervousness. The interaction highlights the mutual respect and admiration among the cast, with Sevigny later expressing her own fondness for Roberts and the strong bond they formed during production.</p>

It details his rise as a prominent voice for the MAGA movement, building a massive following through combative campus debates and social media engagement. The profile explores his influential role in mobilizing young conservatives for Donald Trump while also noting the significant controversy and liberal backlash generated by his provocative statements on race, religion, and other social issues throughout his career.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, issuing warnings to California, New York, and Illinois. The administration has threatened lawsuits and the withholding of federal funding if these states continue to refuse compliance with ICE detainers, which are requests to hold undocumented migrants for federal custody. State officials argue that detainers are not mandatory and that compliance could lead to legal liability and erode community trust, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested following a drive-by shooting that targeted the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. Police reported that at least three bullets were fired into the station's lobby on Friday afternoon, though no injuries occurred as the building was occupied at the time. The incident took place a day after protests were held outside the station regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, but authorities have not yet confirmed a motive or a direct connection between the shooting and the protests. The investigation is currently ongoing.</p>

          <p>Weather forecasts indicate a renewed threat of flash flooding for the Southwest U.S., particularly in parts of California and Arizona, due to incoming monsoonal moisture. This follows recent deadly floods in the region where a two-year-old was swept away by floodwaters. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is strengthening and is expected to become the second hurricane of the season. While Gabrielle is not projected to make landfall in the U.S., it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Conservative lawyer Mary "Maggie" Cleary has been named the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, an office currently investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James. The appointment follows the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, Erik Siebert, who sources say faced pressure from the Trump administration to bring charges against James. President Trump publicly confirmed he wanted Siebert out, fueling concerns of political interference in the Justice Department's investigation into allegations of mortgage fraud against the New York official.</p>

          <p>Dutch police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse around 1,500 anti-immigration protesters in The Hague after demonstrations turned violent. Officials reported that thirty people were arrested and two officers were injured as protesters blocked a highway, threw projectiles, and set a police car on fire. The protest, organized by a right-wing activist demanding stricter migration policies, was condemned by Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders, who both called the violence against law enforcement unacceptable.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" is modernizing the story for a contemporary audience at London's Rose Theatre. Written by Ava Pickett, this version recasts the protagonist as a clever but meddling 21-year-old in Essex who has returned home after failing her university exams. Instead of navigating Regency-era society balls, this Emma interferes in her friends' lives through dating apps and social media, exploring timeless themes of love, friendship, and self-discovery through the lens of modern social dynamics and technology.</p>

Research indicates that the maximum loan now covers just half of the required costs for a minimum standard of living. This financial pressure forces students to juggle demanding work schedules with their studies, leading to missed academic opportunities and significant stress, while others opt to commute long distances from home to save money.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has decided to formally recognize a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. This article analyzes the factors behind the decision, which successive governments had previously tied to a completed peace process. The move is attributed to mounting pressure from within the Labour Party, the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and a desire to align with other G7 nations like France. Critics, however, argue the move is largely symbolic and rewards terrorism without securing concessions from Hamas.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Achieve Breakthrough in Diamond Manipulation with Powerful Lasers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 17:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have made a significant discovery by successfully inducing shock-induced amorphization in diamond capsules using powerful lasers, a process that collapses the material's atomic structure. This breakthrough provides a deeper understanding of how diamonds behave under the extreme pressure and heat required for nuclear fusion energy experiments. By learning to control these flaws, scientists move a step closer to achieving the symmetrical implosion needed to generate stable, clean fusion energy, a potentially limitless power source that could reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts First-in-Nation Ban on Face Coverings for On-Duty Law Enforcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 17:08:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has become the first state to ban most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks or other face coverings. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill in response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles where masked federal agents conducted mass arrests. While the law includes exceptions for tactical gear and medical masks, its enforceability on federal agents is unclear and expected to face legal challenges from the Trump administration, which argues the coverings are necessary for officer safety.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force has flown its first air defense mission over Poland as part of a NATO response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. RAF Typhoon fighter jets were deployed on Friday night to patrol the skies, signaling the alliance's commitment to defending its eastern flank. The mission, named Eastern Sentry, was initiated after 19 Russian drones violated Polish airspace on a single day, an escalation that has heightened tensions between Russia and NATO member states bordering Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The White House has denied that it pressured ABC to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, stating the decision was made internally by the network. Kimmel's show was pulled indefinitely after he made a comment linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The suspension followed public threats from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, to review ABC's broadcast license over the remarks, sparking a debate about free speech, cancel culture, and potential government influence over media content.</p>

          <p>At their party conference, the UK's Liberal Democrats launched a campaign to reclaim patriotism, arguing that national pride and flags have been co-opted by divisive nationalist movements. Former leader Tim Farron delivered a theatrical speech, draping himself in a flag and urging members to stop being "squeamish" about expressing love for their country. The new strategy aims to position the party as the true representative of British values like tolerance and the rule of law, in direct contrast to right-wing figures like Nigel Farage.</p>
