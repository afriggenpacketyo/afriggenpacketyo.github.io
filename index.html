          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer due to inflation. This measure is part of a larger relief package aimed at mitigating the economic impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly on the auto industry. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to supporting small and medium-sized companies affected by these tariffs. The subsidies are expected to reduce household energy bills, with critics suggesting the timing is intended to bolster government support ahead of upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose at a faster pace in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased by 3% compared to the previous year, accelerating from 2.6% in March. The growth was primarily driven by stronger earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors, with the biopharmaceutical and aircraft manufacturing industries showing notable improvement. However, some industries, like the automobile and apparel sectors, faced headwinds due to price competition and shifting demand patterns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study found that some beers brewed in the U.S. contain levels of "forever chemicals" (PFAS) exceeding EPA limits. The study, conducted by ACSâ€™ Environmental Science & Technology, tested 23 beers and found a correlation between PFAS concentrations in municipal drinking water and levels in locally brewed beer. Beers from North Carolina, California, and Michigan had elevated levels of PFAS, while international beers from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable PFAS. The research team concluded that drinking water is a primary route of PFAS contamination in beer.</p>

Despite the price cuts, Citi analysts remain optimistic about the robust sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report by the Lowy Institute warns that the world's poorest nations are facing a "tidal wave of debt" as repayments to China reach record highs in 2025. China's lending through the Belt and Road Initiative has financed infrastructure projects, but new lending is drying up, and developing countries now owe China significant amounts. The poorest 75 countries are expected to make record-high debt repayments to China, jeopardizing spending on essential services like healthcare and education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for sports team owners, potentially impacting the high valuations of professional sports teams. The legislation would affect future owners, limiting their ability to deduct the value of intangible assets like player contracts and media rights over 15 years. While team owners argue the change would significantly reduce revenue, the White House contends it would level the playing field for fans. The potential change could influence the sports ownership market and potentially slow down the rise in team values. (not investment advice)</p>

He criticized Walmart for warning customers of potential price increases due to the tariffs, while his administration downplayed the economic impact. This demand ignores the reality that retailers will have to raise prices or reduce their earnings, with small and medium-size businesses already passing on the costs to consumers through surcharges. The author argues that companies should be transparent about the tariffs' impact rather than engaging in self-defeating denial.</p>
