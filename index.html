          <p>Actor Michael Pitt, known for his role in "Boardwalk Empire," was arrested and indicted in Brooklyn on sexual abuse, criminal sex act, assault, and strangulation charges stemming from alleged incidents in 2020 and 2021. Pitt pleaded not guilty and was released pending his next court date in June. The indictment details multiple alleged instances of sexual assault and violence against an unnamed individual. Pitt's attorney claims the charges are baseless and suspiciously raised years after a consensual relationship, stating they have exonerating evidence and expect the case to be dismissed. Sexual assault is a severe crime, and these allegations are being taken seriously by the court.</p>

          <p>Nintendo projects selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking its initial sales forecast for the console successor. While fourth-quarter revenue and profit fell due to anticipation for the new console, Nintendo's Switch sales reached 10.8 million units for the year. The company's forecasts account for current U.S. tariff rates, with potential price adjustments and demand decreases if tariffs increase, which would hit profits by tens of billions of yen. Despite conservative forecasts, analysts anticipate strong Switch 2 performance, supported by a large existing user base.</p>

The Philippines disputes this, stating the incident involved harassment and dangerous maneuvers by the Chinese coast guard just 11.8 nautical miles from the shoal.

Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico warned against building a new Iron Curtain that would isolate Russia and other countries.

          <h2>The New York Times Examines America's Slide into Competitive Authoritarianism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times argues that America has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, citing the Trump administration's weaponization of government agencies and punitive actions against critics. The authors propose a metric based on the cost of opposing the government, noting that in democracies, citizens should not fear retribution for peaceful opposition. They highlight examples such as investigations into critics, targeting of law firms, and attacks on the media, arguing that these actions have had a chilling effect on opposition and self-censorship.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% decrease in net profit for the current fiscal year due to U.S. tariffs and a stronger yen. The company anticipates a 20.8% drop in operating profit, despite record sales projections. The forecast reflects concerns over Trump's import taxes, particularly on automobiles manufactured outside the U.S. Toyota estimates U.S. trade policies will reduce operating profit by 180 billion yen, while a stronger yen could slash profits by 745 billion yen.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that over half of Black and Latina women in Los Angeles regularly use personal-care products containing formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Researchers analyzed product ingredient lists and found that 53% of participants used products with formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. The study highlights concerns about exposure to these chemicals, particularly among Black and Latina women, and calls for government oversight and regulation of personal-care products to protect consumers. Formaldehyde is a great preservative but is also a known carcinogen.</p>

          <p>Economists are warning that President Trump's proposed budget cuts to scientific research could have dire consequences for the U.S. economy. The proposed cuts would slash funding for agencies like NASA, NSF, and NIH, potentially slowing economic growth. Fundamental science underpins America's economic growth, and government R&D investments have consistently driven private-sector productivity. Economists project that these cuts could reduce America's future GDP by more than 4%.</p>

          <p>California beaches are experiencing a bloom of Velella velella, also known as by-the-wind sailors, which are washing ashore in large numbers. These small, glittering blue creatures are typically found on the open sea and are harmless to humans, though their stinging cells can be irritating. The phenomenon is part of the spring transition, with winds shifting and pushing the Velella towards the coast. These events are thought to be linked to rising ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>Republican-led states are passing new restrictions on citizen-initiated ballot measures, citing concerns about fraud. These laws include requirements for petition-signers to show photo ID and for ballot titles to be read aloud.

          <p>A growing movement of "abortion abolitionists" is lobbying for the criminalization of abortion and advocating for harsh penalties for women who obtain abortions. They argue that even restrictive abortion bans are insufficient and are working to persuade GOP lawmakers to support their policies. Rooted in a nationalistic, fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity, the movement seeks to bring the U.S. under Old Testament biblical law. While their legislative efforts face challenges, the movement is gaining traction within some Republican circles.</p>
