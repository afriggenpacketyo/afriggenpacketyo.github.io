          <p>The prosecution and defense have rested their cases in the Sean "Diddy" Combs sexual assault and racketeering trial. The prosecution presented over 30 witnesses, including former employees and two former girlfriends, who testified about alleged sexual encounters directed by Combs. The defense team did not call any witnesses and immediately moved for acquittal, arguing that the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proof. Closing arguments are scheduled for later in the week, with jury deliberations expected to begin next week. Optimism hinges on the jury's assessment of the testimonies and evidence presented. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is pressuring Congress to finalize a "big, beautiful bill" before lawmakers leave for vacation. He urged senators to remain in Washington until a deal is reached and for the House to immediately pass the bill. The bill faces challenges in the Senate due to policy disagreements among Republicans, particularly regarding the federal deficit and the state-and-local-tax deduction cap. Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to hold a vote this week, but the bill's future in the House remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>An early U.S. intelligence assessment indicates that recent military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have only set back the country's nuclear program by a few months. The report, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency and U.S. Central Command, suggests that while significant damage was done to above-ground structures, enriched uranium and centrifuges remain largely intact. These findings contradict claims by President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated." The White House disputed the assessment, alleging it was leaked to undermine President Trump. </p>

          <p>China is closely monitoring the tensions between Israel and Iran due to its position as the largest importer of Iranian oil and a close political partner of Tehran. Iran exports approximately 90% of its crude oil to China, despite U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing Iran's oil sales. China buys Iranian oil at a discounted rate and uses a "dark fleet" of ships to circumvent sanctions, highlighting the economic and political ties between the two nations. Any disruption to oil supplies in the region would directly affect China's energy security and economic interests. </p>

The club has the right to appeal the decision, but if it stands, Lyon will be replaced in the top flight by Reims. This decision also raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to owner John Textor's involvement with other clubs, including Crystal Palace. </p>

Rural communities often lack sufficient insulation, cooling systems, and access to healthcare, exacerbating the dangers of extreme heat.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A one-year certificate of deposit (CD) currently offers a slightly higher interest rate than a high-yield savings account, making it a potentially more lucrative option for savers. Calculations show that a $10,000 deposit in a one-year CD at 4.45% would earn $445 in interest, while the same deposit in a high-yield savings account at 4.30% would earn $430, assuming the rate remains constant. However, CD interest rates are fixed, while high-yield savings account rates are variable, meaning the CD offers a guaranteed return. With potential interest rate cuts on the horizon, locking in a higher rate with a CD may be a prudent choice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are experiencing a new wave of ocean freight from China as shippers attempt to beat potential tariff increases. President Trump has set a deadline of August 12 for the U.S. and China to reach a trade deal, prompting an increase in container ship arrivals. While officials are not describing it as a "surge," the increased volume is expected to boost trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies. The ports are operating below full capacity and are prepared to handle the additional cargo, but the long-term impact of the trade war remains uncertain. </p>

Challenges include conflict, supply chain issues, and vaccine misinformation, as well as changes in funding for vaccination initiatives. Efforts are underway to address these challenges, including targeted outreach and international initiatives, but the future of global vaccination efforts remains at a critical juncture. </p>

A military intervention in Iran would be challenging due to the country's size, population, and military capabilities. Iran's multi-ethnic composition could lead to prolonged disorder, and an intervention could destabilize the region, impacting global oil supplies. Given these realities, it would be naive to believe that the U.S. could destabilize the Iranian state and walk away unaffected. </p>
