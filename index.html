          <p>The UK government has successfully passed its welfare bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to prevent a rebellion from within its own party. The bill, which originally included stricter eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), was substantially altered, delaying or removing its most controversial measures. This move has been described as chaotic by some MPs and undermines the authority of party leadership and the Chancellor's spending plans. Despite the changes, 44 Labour MPs still voted against the bill, highlighting deep divisions and a breakdown of trust over the reforms.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade under the ticker "FIG" on the NYSE.

The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and over 450,000 customers. In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field emphasized the benefits of going public, including increased brand awareness and allowing the community to share in the company's ownership.

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his interest in deporting U.S. citizens who commit crimes, a proposal that legal experts argue is unconstitutional. Speaking at a migrant detention center, he suggested that even native-born citizens should be subject to removal if they commit serious offenses. This follows a Justice Department memo granting wider discretion for denaturalization, though legal scholars maintain that a crime unrelated to the naturalization process cannot be grounds for deportation. The president acknowledged the legal uncertainty of the plan but stated he would implement it immediately if it were deemed permissible under law.</p>

          <p>Analysts report that China is significantly increasing its science and technology outreach to countries in the Global South, signing numerous bilateral agreements. This strategic shift marks a departure from China's previous focus on collaboration with the United States. The development comes as the U.S. State Department is reportedly closing its Office of Science and Technology Cooperation, which managed such international partnerships.

          <p>France has enacted a new law significantly expanding its ban on smoking to include most public outdoor spaces such as beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries. The measure aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, and reduce the public health impact of tobacco, which causes 75,000 deaths annually in the country. Violators of the new rules could face fines up to 700 euros. While smoking has been prohibited in indoor public spaces since 2008, this law marks a major step in further restricting it, though outdoor café terraces remain one of the last refuges for smokers.</p>

As part of the agreement, Penn will restore records and titles to female athletes who competed against Thomas and issue them formal apologies.

This ingredient has long been a target of the anti-vaccine movement despite numerous studies finding no evidence of harm. The recommendation, which now goes to the CDC for final approval, could affect 4-5% of the U.S. flu vaccine supply that still uses thimerosal in multi-dose vials.

          <p>The Senate Republican's recently passed budget legislation proposes sweeping changes that could significantly affect household finances across the United States. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new deductions for tipped income, overtime pay, and auto loans. It also includes provisions to raise the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. To offset these cuts, the legislation proposes overhauls to social safety net programs, including Medicaid and SNAP, and eliminates various clean energy tax credits. The package is projected to substantially increase the national deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

The father of victim Madison Mogen expressed relief, stating it would provide closure and spare them from a lengthy trial. However, the family of Kaylee Goncalves voiced their fury, stating they were not consulted and believe the death penalty is warranted for the crimes.</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed for his heroic actions after he jumped from a Disney cruise ship to save his daughter who had fallen from the fourth deck into the ocean. Witnesses reported that the incident occurred while the father was taking the girl's picture near a railing on the vessel, which was returning to Florida from the Bahamas. The ship's crew initiated a man overboard alert, turned the vessel around, and launched a rescue boat. Both the father and daughter were successfully recovered from the water after treading water for approximately 10 minutes, with passengers cheering their safe return.</p>
