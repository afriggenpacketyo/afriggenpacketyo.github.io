          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande, once a symbol of China's economic boom, has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market after a spectacular fall fueled by massive debts. The company's collapse, triggered by Beijing's new borrowing rules in 2020, has significantly impacted China's economy, particularly the property sector which accounts for a third of the nation's economic activity. Experts believe the delisting marks a symbolic end, with the focus now shifting to creditor payouts amidst ongoing liquidation hearings and the next hearing is due to take place in September. While Beijing has implemented measures to stimulate the economy, Goldman Sachs predicts property prices will continue to fall until 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX postponed the tenth test flight of its Starship rocket from its Starbase in Texas due to an issue with ground systems. The launch was scheduled for Sunday evening, but the company announced the cancellation just 15 minutes before liftoff. This setback is the latest in a series of challenges for the Starship program, including several failed tests this year, the massive Starship rocket is a major part of Musk's plans to bring humans to Mars. While SpaceX's rapid iteration approach has made it a dominant launch provider, these issues raise concerns about its ability to achieve success with this large rocket.</p>

          <p>A report highlights the tragic consequences of fatal crashes on the A9, Scotland's longest road, where 48 people have died in the last decade. The road's mix of single and dual carriageway sections contributes to dangerous driving conditions, including excessive speeds and risky overtaking. The original deadline to dual the remaining single-carriageway sections was due to be completed by 2025, but has slipped by a decade to 2035. The article shares the story of Chris Strong, who lost his wife, brother-in-law, and mother-in-law in a crash on the A9, emphasizing the lasting impact of these accidents.</p>

          <p>Evidence related to the 9/11 attacks, including a video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol, has surfaced years after the event, despite being turned over to the FBI shortly after the attacks. The evidence was not shared with field agents or top intelligence officials, raising questions about why this information was not used in the initial investigation. The evidence came to light as part of a lawsuit against the Saudi government by the families of 9/11 victims, and the lack of communication has prompted calls for further investigation.</p>

          <p>A claim circulating on social media that the Nobel Committee "quietly removed" Donald Trump's name from the Nobel Peace Prize nominee list in 2025 is false. The Nobel Committee does not publish or confirm the names of Peace Prize nominees, and there is no public list from which anyone could be removed. While individual nominators sometimes announce their submissions, those statements come from the nominators themselves, not the committee, and the committee has no process for removing a nominee.</p>

          <p>Anduril Industries is developing the Fury, an unmanned fighter jet designed to use artificial intelligence and fly without a pilot. CEO Brian Schimpf explained that Fury is a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) that works in coordination with a manned aircraft. The jet is designed to protect manned pilots by detecting enemies and engaging them and the components are designed for mass production using readily available parts. The Air Force hopes to have CCAs fully operational before the end of this decade.</p>

          <p>Planning is underway to send national guard troops to Chicago, an official at the Pentagon confirmed. Hakeem Jeffries, House minority leader, accused President Trump of manufacturing a crisis to justify sending federalized national guard troops into Chicago. The mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, said any such plan from Trump was perpetrating “the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century”. Trump has argued that a military crackdown was necessary in the nation’s capital, and elsewhere, to quell what he said were out of control levels of crime, even though statistics show that serious and violent crime in Washington, and many other American cities, has actually plummeted.</p>

Fleetwood displayed magnificent mental strength to brush aside scar tissue caused by falling short, agonisingly so, twice since late June. The most remarkable thing about this success was how unremarkable it all looked. Fleetwood’s closing 68 was so blissfully simple. The acclaim that met Fleetwood, in a land so far from home and in direct competition with Americans, served to demonstrate his huge popularity.</p>
