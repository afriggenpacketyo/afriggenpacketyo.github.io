          <p>Japan's revenue from the departure tax, levied on travelers leaving the country, reached a record high in fiscal year 2024, according to the Finance Ministry. The total revenue eclipsed the previous record of 44.3 billion yen in fiscal 2019, reaching 48.1 billion yen ($34 billion). The tax, known as the International Tourist Tax, charges 1,000 yen to each traveler departing Japan, regardless of nationality. The increase in revenue reflects a resurgence in tourism, driven by a weaker yen and more available flights, as reported by the Japan National Tourism Organization, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba considering raising the departure tax to further promote tourism and address overcrowding. </p>

          <p>The mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma, proposed a $100 million private trust to provide scholarships and housing assistance to descendants of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre victims. Mayor Monroe Nichols, the city's first Black mayor, calls the plan a "road to repair" rather than reparations, aiming to address the historical stain of the massacre and subsequent redlining and underinvestment in North Tulsa. The trust seeks to secure $105 million in assets by June 2026, with $60 million allocated for revitalizing the Greenwood district. While direct cash payments to survivors are not included, the proposal represents a significant step toward restoring economic vitality to the area destroyed by racial violence.</p>

Azarbonyad sped away from officers in Swalwell, Gateshead, reaching speeds of up to 120 mph on the A1 near Denton Burn, with his passenger pleading for him to stop, fearing he would kill someone.

          <p>Tensions between the US and China have seemingly increased following Asia's premier security forum, the Shangri-La Dialogue. While the US warned of the "threat" posed by China, Beijing has adopted a more cautious approach. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth urged Asian allies to enhance their defense capabilities in response to China's military build-up near Taiwan. China, in turn, accused the US of turning the Asia-Pacific region into a "powder keg," and France's President Emmanuel Macron cautioned against a growing divide between the two superpowers.</p>

Many incidents went unreported, with victims often believing that reporting would be ineffective or that the acts were not significant enough.

          <p>In 2013, Stephen Curry's decision to sign with Under Armour over Nike was a defining moment, influenced by Under Armour's underdog appeal and a botched Nike presentation. Under Armour's strategy involved targeting Curry's teammate, Kent Bazemore, to showcase the brand's attention and products. Nike's mispronunciation of Curry's name and the use of a recycled presentation further solidified his move to Under Armour, who offered a more lucrative deal. Today, Curry is president of the Curry Brand under Under Armour, but some speculate that his business prospects would have been even greater had he stayed with Nike.</p>

This points to a culture where tangible contact with divine power and trust in personal experience are valued over traditional institutions. Even as partisan politics have come to display the dynamics of fundamentalist sects, there are signs that the 60-year slide of organized religion in the West has slowed.</p>

RTM involves a series of mental exercises to reimagine trauma, fading its emotional charge, and has shown dramatic results in some cases. While many researchers remain skeptical, Michael Roy began the first large-scale clinical trial of RTM, investigating its effectiveness compared with prolonged exposure. RTM modestly outperformed prolonged exposure in Roy's early data, with a higher completion rate and a greater percentage of patients no longer meeting the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis after treatment.</p>
