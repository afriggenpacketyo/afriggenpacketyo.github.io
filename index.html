            <p>The Supreme Court upheld a lower court's directive for the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident deported to El Salvador. The court instructed a Maryland federal judge to clarify the order, even after the administration admitted Garcia's deportation was illegal due to a withholding order. Garcia's lawyers deny allegations of his involvement with the MS-13 gang, claiming he has lived in the U.S. for a decade without criminal charges. The Justice Department cited his alleged gang affiliation as justification for his removal despite the acknowledged administrative error.</p>

            <p>Pete Belton, a British man from Derbyshire, was shocked to discover his tattoo featured in a US Department of Homeland Security document used to identify members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Belton's tattoo, a clock face displaying his daughter's birthdate and time, was included in a set of images meant to help identify alleged gang members. The DHS document stated that open source material depicted TdA members with a combination of the tattoos shown in the document. Belton fears the erroneous link could impact his travel plans to the United States.</p>

            <p>In response to measles outbreaks, the CDC now advises some travelers within the U.S. to get an additional measles vaccine shot, aligning with local health authority guidelines. This recommendation primarily affects travelers to areas in Texas and Kansas, where updated guidelines suggest a second dose for adults and teens with only one prior dose, and early vaccination for infants. The CDC maintains that most adults do not need an additional dose, but recommends reassessing vaccination needs for those in areas with community-wide transmission. The outbreaks have resulted in over 600 cases across at least 21 states, with fatalities reported in Texas and New Mexico.</p>

            <p>A new drug called capivasertib has been approved for use on the NHS in England to treat a common type of advanced breast cancer. Clinical trials demonstrated the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression and shrink tumors in some patients. Capivasertib works by blocking the activity of the AKT protein molecule, which drives cancer growth, and is used in combination with hormone therapy. Studies showed that the drug doubled the time it took for the cancer to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months, and shrank tumors in 23% of patients.</p>

However, there are growing concerns about potential supply disruptions and rising costs, leading to customer inquiries about price increases at Apple stores in Beijing.</p>
