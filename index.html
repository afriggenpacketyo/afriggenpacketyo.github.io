          <p>Northern China's traditional rainy season has once again brought devastating floods to Beijing, marking the fifth such disaster since 2012. This year's event is considered unusual because the late July storms primarily impacted the northern part of the capital. This contrasts with severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern regions. The recurring and deadly nature of these floods raises questions about the city's preparedness and the changing climate patterns affecting the area.</p>

However, his initial weeks at the club have been overshadowed by significant off-field chaos. This includes a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen over player registration due to financial issues and major delays in the reconstruction of the Nou Camp stadium. The ongoing turmoil provides a complex backdrop to the former Manchester United striker's debut season.</p>
