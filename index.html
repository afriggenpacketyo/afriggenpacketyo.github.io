          <h2>Ackman Voices Concerns Over Trump's Tariff Policies and Potential Economic Fallout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 23:18:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has warned that President Trump's tariff policies could lead to an "economic nuclear winter" by eroding confidence in the U.S. as a reliable trading partner. Ackman criticized the tariffs, which impose levies on imports from numerous countries, as disproportionate and damaging to low-income consumers already under economic stress. He suggested Trump should reconsider his approach to avoid severe negative consequences for the U.S. economy. Ackman also took aim at Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, alleging a conflict of interest due to his firm's financial positioning.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has strongly criticized the U.S. government's deportation of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to a dangerous prison in El Salvador, calling the action "wholly lawless." Judge Paula Xinis stated there was minimal evidence to support allegations of Abrego Garcia's gang affiliation and that a previous ruling barred his deportation to El Salvador due to potential persecution. The judge highlighted the government's claim that it couldn't bring him back because he was no longer in U.S. custody as "eye-popping," accusing them of circumventing legal protections. The Justice Department has requested a pause on Xinis' ruling, while the case has also led to the suspension of a Justice Department attorney.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office established in the 1960s to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions. This decision has sparked concerns that the closure could lead to increased disputes between law enforcement and minority communities. The office has a history of intervening in periods of heightened unrest, acting as a mediator between community leaders, law enforcement, and victims' families to prevent escalation. Former leaders of the service fear that reassigning staff to federal prosecutors' offices will undermine the agency's credibility and effectiveness in preventing racial strife.</p>

          <p>As global trade tensions rise due to President Trump's tariffs, exchanges are implementing trading halts to prevent market crashes. These "circuit breakers" are triggered when stock prices or futures fall rapidly in a single session, providing a pause to avoid panic selling. In non-U.S. trading hours, a 7% drop in S&P futures triggers a halt, while the NYSE has its own system of circuit breakers at various percentage thresholds. The Russell 2000 futures, tracking small-cap stocks, briefly hit the 7% "limit down" threshold overnight.</p>

          <h2>International Stock Markets Tumble Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>International stock markets have fallen dramatically amid fears of a global trade war following Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index dived nearly 8%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell more than 6%, and South Korea's Kospi lost 4.4%. Mr Trump warned foreign governments would have to pay "a lot of money" to lift his tariffs, which he described as "medicine". Investors and political leaders have struggled to determine whether the tariffs are here to stay, or are part of a permanent new regime or a negotiating tactic to win concessions from other countries.</p>

          <p>The Stay in LA campaign held a rally in Sun Valley to draw attention to the struggling local entertainment industry. The rally featured speakers from across the entertainment industry and state and national politicians who called on state and local leaders to do more to help an industry that supports tens of thousands of workers across Southern California. Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed doubling the state’s film and TV tax credit program to $750 million a year, up from its current total of $330 million. Stay in LA has urged a slate of proposals to be included in the overall disaster relief efforts, such as removing tax incentive caps for productions that shoot in Los Angeles County during the next three years.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna say they have cut a deal to end the fight over proxy voting for new parents, which will re-open the House floor after nearly a week of legislative paralysis. House Republican leaders will formalize "vote pairing," a procedure that allows a member who is absent during a vote to coordinate with a present member on the other side of the matter to offset the absence. In light of the deal, sources said Rep. Luna will not trigger her bipartisan discharge petition -- which has 218 signatures -- to allow mothers and fathers to vote remotely for up to 12 weeks after childbirth.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said Sunday evening that he is not intentionally engineering the ongoing stock market sell-off, but said little to try and dissuade it. He cited the trade deficit with China as his rationale for pressing on with his tariffs plan despite the recent pain in the markets. He added that he spoke with European and Asian leaders over the weekend on the tariffs rolled out by his administration, which are expected to take effect in the coming week. The comments came as U.S. stock futures dropped on Sunday evening, with Dow Jones Industrial average futures sliding 4.1%, accelerating losses that carried through from Thursday and Friday and indicating more selling is likely to hit Monday morning.</p>

          <p>Newly qualified doctors in the UK are facing uncertainty over their job locations, with some being told their placement only weeks before starting. Hundreds of medical students have been given "placeholder jobs," meaning they only know the general area they will be working in. This system, implemented to reduce stress and inequality, has led to a higher proportion of students not getting their preferred placements. The British Medical Association has accused the government of failing to plan for the increase in resident doctors, potentially leading to students moving abroad.</p>
