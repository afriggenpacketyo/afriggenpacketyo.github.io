          <p>Two Israeli embassy staff members were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, was apprehended after chanting "Free, Free Palestine." The victims, a man and a woman, were attending a Jewish event at the museum. Authorities are investigating the shooting as a potential act of antisemitism and terrorism, with support pledged from local and federal law enforcement. The event was hosted by the American Jewish Committee, and the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations condemned the "depraved act."</p>

          <p>One year after Labour's general election victory, the government is attempting to deflect criticism by blaming the Conservatives for current issues. Examples include the handover of the Chagos Islands and the sentencing review initiated by the previous government. The Labour government claims the Conservatives failed to address these issues adequately during their time in power. As part of a series of news releases, the Ministry of Justice is considering mandatory chemical castration for sexual assault offenders. The government faces challenges with the economy, a competitive political landscape, and declining poll numbers.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers granted to California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers, while Democrats claim such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials are prepared to sue the federal government if the waivers are revoked. Sixteen other states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards, potentially impacting cities and states around the country.</p>

          <p>Chronic water shortages in Gaza are worsening due to Israel's military offensive, causing displacement and fuel shortages for desalination and hygiene plants. The UN warns that water and sanitation facilities may shut down by the end of the week without fuel deliveries. Israel previously cut off power to main desalination plants, vital for Gazans. While Israel permits basic supplies, fuel is excluded. Children are accustomed to drinking salty water, leading to kidney problems. A desalination plant in southern Gaza has reduced production by 80% due to electricity cuts, exacerbating the crisis.</p>

Kim emphasized the need for immediate repairs, viewing it as a political issue directly related to the authority of the state.

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega tsunami” could potentially devastate parts of America's West Coast if a strong earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone within the next 50 years. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region, potentially impacting cities like Seattle and Portland. The resulting tsunami's waves could reach extreme heights, and the earthquake could also cause coastal land to sink, increasing the risk. The most severe effects would be in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

While India aimed to attract business fleeing China, Trump's recent backing off from tariffs has wrong-footed India.

Indian officials are working to secure tariff reductions, but Trump's remarks have complicated negotiations. Despite this, India has been making strides in attracting Apple's supply chain with government support and lower labor costs.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy, effective Thursday, will provide a fixed sum to wholesalers regardless of current prices, targeting a 7.40 yen per liter reduction in the first week. The program aims to lower prices by at least 1 yen weekly until a 10 yen reduction is achieved by mid-June. The reintroduction of subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>

Kato expressed concerns about the impact of Trump's tariffs on the global economy.
