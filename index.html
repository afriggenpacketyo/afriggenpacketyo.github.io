          <p>Iran launched approximately 30 missiles at Israel, impacting Haifa, Tel Aviv, Be'er Yaakov, and Nes Ziona, wounding at least 21 people after the U.S. conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Searches are underway in Tel Aviv for individuals trapped under collapsed buildings, and the IDF is investigating a potential interceptor malfunction in Haifa. The Iranian assault followed U.S. strikes on nuclear sites in Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo, using B2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles, while Israel struck missile and drone sites in Iran. Since Israel's "Operation Rising Lion" began, Iran has reportedly launched over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel, resulting in 24 deaths, and Israel's strikes have killed 722 people in Iran. </p>

          <p>The Pentagon revealed details of the U.S. operation, "Operation Midnight Hammer," involving seven B-2 Spirit bombers striking Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The mission, described as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history," involved multiple in-flight refuelings, decoys, and fighter jet support, with over 75 precision-guided weapons deployed. Initial assessments indicate "extremely severe damage and destruction" to all three sites, and the U.S. is on high alert for potential Iranian retaliation. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack "an incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or people. </p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, the UK government clarified it was informed in advance but did not participate in the operation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly called for de-escalation, and questions have been raised within the government regarding the legality of involvement. Washington's decision to act independently meant the UK did not have to authorize the use of its military base on Diego Garcia. The UK's position remains focused on de-escalation, but potential Iranian retaliation could require further decisions from the UK government.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. This appeal follows Iran's warning of potential actions to defend its sovereignty after U.S. strikes on nuclear sites. Iranian state media reported parliamentary support for closing the strait, though the final decision rests with Iran's national security council. Blocking the Strait of Hormuz could significantly impact the global economy, as it facilitates approximately 20% of global crude oil consumption.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This transformation was driven by government subsidies, long-term planning, and the mobilization of the economy towards EV production. Chinese companies like BYD now lead the global EV market, and the country has built the world's largest public charging network. While Western countries view China's approach as unfair business practice, China insists that all companies have access to the same resources.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. Ketamine, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to release a report on psychedelics later this year, including updated information on ketamine, and a psychiatrist hopes to set up a clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report highlights the issue of Social Security overpayments and offers tips to prevent them. It advises recipients to check their earnings history, understand disability benefit rules, and be aware of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) asset limits. The report also notes that Social Security sometimes underpays recipients, and it is crucial to report mistakes promptly and keep records of all communications with the agency. Legal aid is available for those facing overpayment problems, though finding lawyers can be challenging.</p>

          <p>Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Alexei Navalny, is undeterred in her mission to oppose Vladimir Putin, despite the dangers and a Russian arrest warrant. She considers Alexei's memoir, "Patriot," his final act of defiance, and refuses to be afraid, despite the possibility of kidnapping or poisoning. Navalny's political network inside Russia has been crushed, and his team operates in exile, but Yulia continues to lobby Western leaders to stand up to Putin. She says that the fight is not finished, and that her husband still has millions of supporters.</p>

          <p>Scholars and Iranian Americans are concerned about the fate of Isfahan's architectural treasures following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The city, home to landmarks from Persia's 17th-century regional power, including intricately tiled mosques, bridges, and Naqsh-e Jahan Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is near one of the targeted nuclear sites. While there were no initial reports of damage in central Isfahan, the potential impact on these cultural assets remains a concern given the historical and cultural significance of the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities was based on his belief that Iran is close to developing nuclear weapons, differing from the consensus of the U.S. intelligence community. While officials acknowledge Iran's uranium stockpiles, they maintain that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suspended the nuclear-weapons program in 2003. Trump's thinking aligns with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who believes Iran is stockpiling uranium to build a weapon, and the strikes were driven by a sense of opportunity following Israeli actions against Iranian facilities and scientists.</p>

Cammack, an abortion opponent, said the experience highlighted the need for common ground, while abortion rights activists contend the law created the problem.

The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms, and the most energy-intensive firms will have their network charges cut. The strategy also aims to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Washington is bracing for a response from Tehran, with officials acknowledging the potential for unpredictable actions. While Iran downplayed the impact of the strikes, the U.S. military claimed "extremely severe damage and destruction." The U.S. is also concerned that Iran may have moved critical equipment and materiel from its site in Fordo to an undisclosed location before the U.S. operation began. Democrats are pushing for a vote to restrict Trump under the War Powers Act, and experts say the likeliest scenario would involve disruptions to shipping lanes.</p>
