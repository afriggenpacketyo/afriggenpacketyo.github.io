          <p>Oscar Piastri of McLaren emerged victorious at the Miami Grand Prix, marking his fourth win of the season, followed closely by his teammate Lando Norris after a heated battle with Max Verstappen. Piastri showcased exceptional skill, overtaking both Kimi Antonelli of Mercedes and Verstappen to seize the lead and maintain it until the race's end. Norris recovered impressively from an early setback, while George Russell of Mercedes secured the final podium spot, fending off Verstappen. Ferrari experienced internal team tensions as Lewis Hamilton's request to pass Charles Leclerc was initially denied before being accepted, however Hamilton could not capitalize on the opportunity.</p>

Trump also mentioned he would not fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his term concludes in 2026. These statements follow previous instances where Trump teased the possibility of seeking a third term, despite constitutional limitations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns over the decline of the American film industry and a perceived national security threat due to foreign incentives attracting filmmakers. Trump argues that these tariffs will revitalize US manufacturers and safeguard jobs, but global economic disruption and rising prices are anticipated as a result. He appointed film stars as special envoys to promote Hollywood business opportunities and expressed a desire to bring the industry back to America. In April, China reduced its quota of American films allowed into the country as a result of Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's inconsistency with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3, ending their seven-game winning streak. May allowed four runs, all scored on home runs by Austin Riley resulting from poorly executed sweepers. Despite striking out six and pitching 5 ⅔ innings, May's recent performance has been disappointing, with 14 runs allowed in his last three starts. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, and despite late efforts, they couldn't overcome the early deficit.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house America's most violent offenders. Trump stated the reopening would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," citing concerns about violent and repeat criminal offenders. Alcatraz, closed in 1963 and now a tourist site, was originally a naval defense fort before becoming a military and later a federal prison, housing notorious criminals like Al Capone. The closure was due to high operating costs.</p>

          <p>Nearly one million Americans across 17 states may lose their health insurance as Aetna's parent company, CVS, announced its departure from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. CVS cited the scheduled expiration of ACA tax credits and financial incentives, implemented by the Biden administration, as a contributing factor. Despite exceeding financial expectations, CVS stated Aetna is not a major player in the ACA marketplace compared to other health insurance plans and will continue to offer other options. The ACA credits led to record enrollment in ACA programs this year, with nearly 24 million people participating.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist who has promised to “Make Romania Great Again,” won the first round of his country’s presidential election on Sunday, bucking the recent trend of voters punishing candidates seen as friendly to President Trump. Simion, who garnered more than 40 percent of the votes, will face Nicusor Dan, the centrist mayor of Bucharest, in a runoff on May 18. Simion's success contrasts with recent elections in Canada and Australia, where voters favored parties opposed to Trump, signaling a potential shift in European politics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on movies "produced in foreign lands," claiming that the US film industry is dying due to incentives offered by other countries. Trump stated this is a national security threat and that he has authorized the Commerce Department and the US Trade Representative to implement the tariff. The announcement comes amid a trade war with China, which has already reduced the quota of American movies allowed into the country. Experts warn that retaliation against the tariffs could be devastating for the US film industry.</p>

The outcome is being closely watched in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow due to Romania's strategic importance as a transit route for military aid to Ukraine and its role in NATO's air policing missions.</p>

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to preserve their fertility, some experts caution against relying on the procedure, citing its high cost and lack of guarantees. Vardit Ravitsky, president of the Hastings Center, warns that egg freezing is a gamble with financial and medical risks, and even successful pregnancies can be riskier at older ages. Critics also argue that the emphasis on profits in private equity-backed fertility companies can create warped incentives, potentially pressuring doctors to encourage more cycles to generate more revenue. Despite the criticisms, egg freezing continues to grow in popularity.</p>
