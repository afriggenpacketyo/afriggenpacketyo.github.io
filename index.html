        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the death of an infant from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The baby's mother was not vaccinated against the illness during her pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns. This event highlights growing concerns over declining vaccination rates, as none of the main childhood vaccines in England met the 95% uptake target last year. Officials are urging pregnant women and parents of young children to ensure timely vaccinations to prevent further tragedies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in popularity for matcha has led to significant supply shortages and soaring prices, even in its native Japan. Driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, the export value of Japanese green tea has quadrupled in a decade. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used for matcha, jumped 170% at a recent auction, forcing retailers to ration supplies. Producers are struggling to meet demand due to an aging workforce and the labor-intensive cultivation process, prompting the Japanese government to consider subsidies for farmers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has issued a warning to parents about the critical importance of school attendance at the start of the new term. New data reveals that over half of pupils who missed school during the first week last year became persistently absent, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. While absenteeism has decreased from its post-pandemic peak, it remains significantly higher than pre-COVID levels. The government is implementing programs like attendance and behaviour hubs to support struggling schools and address the root causes of poor attendance.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's administration is enforcing a ban on "non-standard" street art, leading to the removal of hundreds of painted crosswalks across the state, including rainbow-themed pride memorials and student-designed safety projects. The state's transportation department claims the move is to keep roadways free of political ideologies and cites safety concerns, despite research suggesting such art improves driver behavior. Several municipalities, including Fort Lauderdale and Key West, are vowing to fight the directive, which critics condemn as a politically motivated attack on local governance.</p>

          <p>In a notable development for China's commercial space industry, a Kinetica-1 rocket from Beijing-based CAS Space has successfully launched two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a Mexican startup. The mission, described as Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit, aims to demonstrate the viability of small, meaningful satellites. The two femtosatellites, each weighing under 100 grams, carry selfie and artistic payloads. CAS Space hailed the launch as a significant milestone, marking China's entry into the North American commercial launch market and expanding global space cooperation.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating a coordinated wave of "swatting" incidents, where false reports of active shooters have caused panic and lockdowns at numerous U.S. universities. These hoaxes trigger massive law enforcement responses, wasting resources and creating dangerous situations while inflicting significant psychological distress on students and staff. Although no actual violence occurred in these recent cases, officials emphasize that every threat must be treated as real, leading to widespread disruption. The federal investigation aims to identify patterns and apprehend those responsible for the nationwide threats.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the return of a Confederate memorial to Arlington National Cemetery, one of several moves by the Trump administration to restore commemorations of the Confederacy. The administration is also returning a portrait of Robert E. Lee to West Point and reinstalling a statue of Albert Pike in Washington, D.C. Hegseth stated the policy is to honor American history, not erase it, a claim critics contrast with President Trump's complaints about museum exhibits on slavery. The actions have sparked condemnation for glorifying a cause that fought against the United States.</p>

          <p>The deployment of U.S. warships to the southern Caribbean has heightened anxiety among Venezuelans, who are already enduring a prolonged crisis of hyperinflation and authoritarian rule under Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals, engaging in some diplomatic talks while also denouncing Maduro as a "narco-president." While some Venezuelans hope for intervention, many are weary and simply trying to maintain normalcy amidst the political turmoil. The U.S. states the naval presence is for deterring narcotics trafficking, but the scale of the operation has fueled speculation about other motives.</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism, arguing that its characteristics have long been present in American history through systemic racism. The author contends that the fight against authoritarianism is not new and that Black Americans have historically led this resistance through belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of protest, and profound faith. The article posits that understanding fascism requires looking beyond political analogies to European history and recognizing its deep racial roots within the United States. It calls for continued struggle inspired by the legacy of Black resistance.</p>

The U.S. State Department cited the failure of Palestinian leadership to renounce extremism as the reason. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from several EU foreign ministers and the UN, who argue it violates the UN headquarters agreement ensuring access for foreign diplomats.</p>

          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the demand for home air conditioning is increasing, with retailers reporting significant sales growth. This trend has sparked a debate about the environmental impact, financial cost, and health implications of widespread air-con use.

While air conditioning can improve comfort and productivity, it also increases electricity consumption at a time of high energy prices, prompting calls for more energy-efficient solutions and government incentives for cleaner technologies.</p>

The council cited a story about local government reorganization as misinformation, while the paper's editor called the ban an attack on local democracy. This action reflects a broader trend among some right-wing politicians who bypass traditional media engagement, potentially benefiting electorally by positioning the press as an establishment foil. However, this strategy may also backfire by preventing the party from publicizing its achievements and appearing unaccountable to voters.</p>

          <h2>UCLA Football Suffers Decisive 43-10 Loss to Utah in Season Opener</h2>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins began their football season with a disappointing 43-10 defeat against Utah at the Rose Bowl. The team struggled on both sides of the ball, with the defense missing numerous tackles and failing to pressure Utah's quarterback, who accounted for 293 total yards. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a difficult debut, and the running game was largely ineffective. The lopsided loss exposes significant challenges for the team under coach DeShaun Foster, raising questions about their preparedness after a preseason where practices were largely shielded from public and media view.</p>

          <p>A nationwide manhunt is underway in Germany for Marla-Svenja Liebich, a neo-Nazi activist convicted of incitement and defamation, after she failed to surrender to prison to begin an 18-month sentence. Liebich, formerly known as Sven Liebich, gained notoriety for decades of far-right hate speech. The case has also sparked debate over Germany's new Self-Determination Act, as Liebich legally changed her gender after conviction and requested to be incarcerated in a women's facility, a move critics allege is an abuse of the law. Authorities have been criticized for failing to apprehend the well-known extremist.</p>

          <p>Germany is reflecting on the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), as the country opened its borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, and its consequences are still debated today. While data shows nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave were employed by 2022, challenges in integration and a higher unemployment rate among migrants persist. The anniversary has reignited discussions on immigration policy, with current Chancellor Friedrich Merz adopting a more critical stance.</p>

          <p>Police in London arrested five people after masked protesters attempted to enter a hotel housing asylum seekers in West Drayton. The incident occurred as two anti-asylum groups, totaling around 500 people, marched on the Crowne Plaza hotel, damaging security fences in the process. The protests in London were part of a series of demonstrations and counter-demonstrations held across England and Scotland concerning the government's policy of using hotels for asylum seeker accommodation. Police deployed additional officers and issued a dispersal order to prevent further disorder, with two officers sustaining minor injuries.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to mitigate human-wildlife conflict, biologists are using drones equipped with loudspeakers to scare gray wolves away from cattle ranches near the California-Oregon border. The drones blast a variety of sounds, including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and dialogue from the film "Marriage Story," to haze the predators and interrupt hunts. This nonlethal technique was developed by USDA researchers as wolf populations recover and expand, leading to increased livestock depredation. While the high cost and terrain limitations of the technology are drawbacks, initial patrols have shown success in protecting livestock.</p>
