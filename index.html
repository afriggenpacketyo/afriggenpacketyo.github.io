          <h2>Trump Announces Plans to Lower Drug Costs by Matching International Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 21:54:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced an executive order to lower medication costs in the U.S. by tying them to the lowest prices paid by other economically advanced countries, an idea he dubs the "most favored nation" pricing model. This plan, aimed at Medicare medications administered in doctor's offices, seeks to address the longstanding issue of high drug prices in the U.S. compared to other nations. However, the proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it could stifle innovation and research. The industry unsuccessfully fought a similar effort during Trump's first term, and legal challenges are anticipated, though Trump insists he will do the right thing.</p>

          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Geneva, reporting "substantial progress" in easing trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng both indicated positive outcomes, with plans for a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials from both countries. This meeting is the first since President Trump escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures. While details remain scarce, the talks have raised investors' hopes for a reduction in tariffs, though analysts caution against over-optimism, emphasizing that significant details are still needed before any decisions are made.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is reportedly donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, potentially serving as a temporary Air Force One. The gift, estimated to be worth around $400 million, has sparked controversy and ethical concerns, particularly due to its immense value and Trump's intention to take ownership after leaving office. While Qatari officials say the transfer is still under consideration, Trump defended the idea, criticizing Democrats for questioning the "free of charge gift."

          <p>The U.S. government has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to the spread of the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the decision, citing the need to protect the U.S. livestock industry. The USDA said the screwworm has been detected in remote farms in Mexico, approximately 700 miles from the U.S. border. The suspension will continue on a month-to-month basis until containment is achieved, with the USDA emphasizing that the measure is about food and animal safety, not politics.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Taiwan have faced criticism for removing the "Han" category from demographic groups listed on the official information page of the Executive Yuan. This move is seen as an effort by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to distance the island from mainland China and promote Taiwan's indigenous identity. The revised web page now categorizes Han Chinese, the majority on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as "other population." Critics argue that this change denies the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and mainland China.</p>

This system, which ensures affordable medical care for all residents through capped out-of-pocket costs, is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that turning the healthcare system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust, emphasizing the need for measured, long-term debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures.

Pirro's selection has also drawn criticism due to her history of spreading election misinformation. While some Democrats have expressed concerns, others believe she may be a more suitable candidate than Martin, but she will have to shift from her provocative TV pronouncements to abide by the Justice Department's tradition.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, remains popular in the Philippines. Supporters view his arrest and extradition as political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. As Filipinos vote in midterm elections, Duterte is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City. His arrest has divided the Philippines, with some polls showing support for the international investigation and others believing he is a victim of political persecution.</p>

In a letter, the families cited recently unsealed evidence linking Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi intelligence agent, to the hijackers. As Lutnick prepares for economic talks with Saudi Arabia, the families are requesting that he make the case for al-Bayoumi's extradition to the United States.

The talks, shrouded in secrecy, are intended to help stabilize world markets and relieve companies dependent on U.S.-China trade.

The measures also include preventing care homes from recruiting staff from abroad and prioritizing residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer. Critics have questioned the effectiveness of the plans, particularly the lack of a cap on numbers, while supporters say it is a step in the right direction.

          <p>The United States will suspend imports of live cattle through ports along the southern border with Mexico for at least two weeks to review the joint strategy in the fight against the screwworm. Secretary Brooke Rollins said the screwworm was recently detected in remote farms about 700 miles away from the U.S. border. The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments in late November but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place to evaluate the animals prior to entry into the country.
