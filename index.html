          <p>US pharmaceutical giant Merck is scrapping a planned £1 billion expansion of its UK operations and cutting 125 jobs, blaming successive UK governments for undervaluing innovative medicines and insufficient investment in the life sciences sector. The decision, a significant blow to the UK's drug industry, comes despite initial construction already underway. Experts warn that other major pharmaceutical companies might follow suit, with some already reducing or abandoning UK investment plans. The article notes that a political landscape in the US, pressuring drug companies to invest domestically, also plays a role in these decisions.</p>

          <p>Emily Thornberry has announced her withdrawal from the Labour deputy leadership contest, narrowing the field to four candidates vying to replace Angela Rayner. Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, had gathered only 13 nominations from Labour MPs, significantly short of the 80 required to progress to the next stage. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson leads the race with 116 nominations, while other contenders continue to seek support ahead of the deadline. This development reshapes the dynamics of the contest, as candidates navigate a fragmented parliamentary landscape to secure their positions.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index reached a new record high, buoyed by hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts and positive inflation data, with SoftBank Group shares jumping over 10%. This surge follows reports of a significant cloud-computing deal between OpenAI and Oracle, benefiting SoftBank due to its ties to Oracle and the "Stargate" program. The article notes that energy and utilities stocks led gains on the Nikkei 225, while other Asian markets like South Korea's Kospi also saw advances. US equity futures remained largely unchanged as markets awaited key consumer inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump reportedly urged the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil, a move that has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic. The proposal, made during a meeting with US and EU officials, aims to further punish trade with Moscow and pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. However, European officials are wary of alienating key trading partners and adopting Trump's tariff strategy, especially given Europe's own complicated trade relationship with Russia. Analysts believe the EU is unlikely to acquiesce, preferring diplomacy over trade wars.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that the Justice Department is considering seeking the death penalty for Decarlos Brown Jr., the alleged killer of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee stabbed on a Charlotte light rail train. This decision follows President Donald Trump's call for "vicious" and decisive action against violent criminals, particularly repeat offenders. Zarutska, 23, was killed in an unprovoked attack captured on video, and Brown has a history of prior arrests. Trump has publicly advocated for the death penalty in this case, blaming "catch and release" policies for such tragedies.</p>

          <p>A new report, "The Global State of Democracy 2025," reveals that democratic performance declined in over half of the 173 countries surveyed last year, with only a third making progress. Significant declines were observed in credible elections, access to justice, and effective parliaments, with Africa and Europe accounting for the largest shares of this global trend. The article highlights a particularly acute deterioration in press freedom, marking the biggest drop in 50 years across 43 countries. The report also notes instances where the Trump administration has eroded US democratic norms, raising concerns about global implications.</p>

          <h2>San Francisco Housing Costs Return to 'Normal' Levels, Report Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 23:09:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Redfin report suggests San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal" levels, specifically their July 2018 mortgage payment-to-income ratio, due to slowing home-price growth and falling mortgage rates. This normalization reflects a pre-pandemic equilibrium for tech-driven metros where wages have grown significantly faster than the national average. However, the article clarifies that "normal" for San Francisco still means households spend a much higher percentage of income on mortgages than the national average. The AI boom is also reportedly spiking rents, crowding out lower-wage tenants despite these trends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reflects on the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk, a conservative provocateur and founder of Turning Point USA, emphasizing the danger of escalating political violence in America. It positions Kirk as a charismatic figure who fearlessly debated liberal ideas on college campuses, a practice that ultimately exposed him to the sniper who ended his life. While acknowledging Kirk's controversial stances, the author deplores the violence, arguing that freedom of speech must be defended regardless of one's agreement with the content. The piece warns against using this tragedy as a pretext for political repression, advocating for truth and rejecting calls for further division.</p>

          <p>Ghana has agreed to accept West African nationals deported from the US, a key tactic of President Donald Trump's administration to curb immigration. Ghanaian President John Mahama confirmed the agreement, stating the "first batch" of 14 deportees, including Nigerians and a Gambian, has already arrived. This decision comes amidst increased US tariffs on Ghanaian goods and visa restrictions for its nationals, although Mahama maintains positive relations. The article notes that other African countries like Rwanda and Eswatini have also accepted deportees, while Nigeria has pushed back against accepting third-party individuals, particularly prisoners.</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has discovered rocks in a dry river channel that may contain the strongest hints yet of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported. While emphasizing the need for in-depth analysis on Earth, the findings represent a significant step in the quest to determine if humanity is alone in the universe. The sample from Neretva Vallis contains organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, compounds often linked to microbial activity on Earth. The article notes that while non-biological processes could also be responsible, this is the most compelling candidate found so far.</p>

          <p>A home in Los Angeles's Fairfax District, dubbed the "Trash House" due to three-foot-high stacks of garbage bags in its yard, has sparked controversy and debate among neighbors. While some express concerns about public health and fire hazards, others defend the homeowner, Raymond Gaon, as a misunderstood Vietnam veteran meticulously collecting materials for recycling. The article notes that Mayor Karen Bass previously declared the home a "public health emergency," leading to a cleanup, but clutter has reaccumulated. Advocates stress the need for compassion and mediated solutions, warning that further pressure could exacerbate the homeowner's seclusion.</p>
