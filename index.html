The ruling doesn't significantly impact the UK-US trade deal as it doesn't affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminumâ€”the bulk of UK exports.  While the deal aims to reduce these tariffs, its implementation remains pending, causing uncertainty for UK exporters.</p>

          <p>Japan's defense minister, Gen Nakatani, stated that Japan will not purchase US defense equipment in exchange for tariff reductions.  This comes after a Japanese trade negotiator suggested such purchases could help reduce the trade deficit.  Nakatani emphasized that security and tariff issues are separate.
