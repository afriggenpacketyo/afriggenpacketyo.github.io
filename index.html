        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, sending the measure to the president's desk. The cuts primarily target foreign aid programs and eliminate all federal support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which funds NPR and PBS. Opponents, including public media executives, warned the move would devastate local stations, particularly in rural areas that rely on them for emergency alerts and essential programming. Despite some Republican dissent over the impacts on their constituents, the bill passed narrowly, marking a significant shift in federal spending priorities.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with China's Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, during a recent visit to Beijing, signaling ongoing high-level engagement between the tech giant and the Chinese government. During his trip, Huang also met with other senior officials and praised Chinese firms' "world class" AI models. He noted high demand for Nvidia's H20 AI chip, which is designed to comply with U.S. export controls, though sales are pending U.S. government approval. The discussions occur as Nvidia navigates complex U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China while trying to maintain its presence in the critical market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a late-night vote, Congress approved a $9 billion spending cuts package, sending the legislation to President Trump's desk just before a critical deadline. The bill, which passed the House by a narrow 216-213 margin, targets foreign aid through USAID and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans framed the passage as a victory for fiscal responsibility and a successful test of the rescissions process, which had not been used in over two decades. The vote was preceded by intense debate, with Democrats attempting to force votes on the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump linked the proposed tariffs to the ongoing legal proceedings against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula labeled this move as "unacceptable blackmail" and a "grave attack on national sovereignty," vowing that no foreign leader would dictate terms to Brazil. The diplomatic dispute highlights escalating tensions between the two administrations, with potential implications for trade and international relations ahead of Brazil's next presidential election.</p>

          <p>Stephen Colbert announced during his show that "The Late Show" will conclude its run in May 2026, and the entire program will be discontinued by CBS rather than having a new host take over. The network stated the cancellation is a financial decision, unrelated to the show's content or other matters at its parent company, Paramount Global. However, the announcement has sparked skepticism, coming shortly after Colbert criticized Paramount for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump. Some public figures and fans have questioned the timing, suggesting political motivations may have influenced the decision to end the top-rated late-night show.</p>

          <p>In response to growing pressure and a recent news report, President Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move follows a Wall Street Journal article detailing an allegedly lewd birthday letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has denied and threatened to sue over. While Trump's supporters have demanded more transparency, critics suggest that releasing only grand jury transcripts is insufficient and that other evidence would be more revealing. The action appears aimed at quelling discontent within his political base.</p>

          <p>A key index tracking China's progress toward a market-based economy has shown a decline, prompting calls from Chinese economists for more pro-market reforms.

Researchers highlighted the need to reverse this trend to address economic imbalances and intense domestic competition.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in the rapid rise of rice prices after the government released stockpiles, though inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs could reintroduce inflationary pressures. The economic data arrives amid concerns over slowing growth and political uncertainty ahead of an upcoming election. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the surprising cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," questioning the official explanation of it being a "purely a financial decision" by CBS. The author argues that the move fits a broader pattern of the network's parent company, Paramount Global, making decisions that appear to capitulate to President Donald Trump, especially as it seeks federal approval for a merger. The piece contrasts Colbert's high ratings with recent company actions, such as settling a lawsuit with Trump. It suggests the cancellation may be a strategic sacrifice to appease political interests, undermining the network's journalistic legacy.</p>

The president has also targeted Powell over a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. While the president can voice his displeasure, the ability to fire a Fed chair "for cause" is legally untested and could destabilize financial markets, highlighting the delicate balance between political pressure and the central bank's independence.

The raids occurred shortly after a federal judge blocked agents from using such tactics, escalating the conflict between federal immigration authorities and state officials.</p>

          <h2>FDA Authorizes Juul to Resume Selling Tobacco and Menthol E-Cigarettes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:09:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reversed a previous ban and authorized Juul to continue marketing its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes. The agency concluded that the company's studies demonstrate its products can be a less harmful alternative for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision is a major milestone for Juul, which has faced intense scrutiny and legal challenges for its role in the teen vaping epidemic. Anti-tobacco groups have condemned the move, arguing the product that sparked a public health crisis should not be allowed back on the market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna clarified that his department is legally required to transfer inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when presented with a federal judicial warrant. He emphasized that these warrants, signed by a judge for criminal charges, are distinct from civil immigration detainers, which the department does not honor under state sanctuary laws. Luna stated that the inmates transferred were sought for significant crimes and that his department does not assist with ICE's street-level enforcement operations. The clarification comes amid heightened community fear over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to "REAL Cane Sugar" in its soda, a move he framed as a victory for taste and health. This article analyzes the announcement, noting that while Mexican Coke made with cane sugar has a cult following, the health benefits are negligible as both sweeteners are metabolically similar. The author suggests the move is a political gesture, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement but having little substantive impact on public health. It's seen as a way for Trump to score an easy political win amid other, more complex controversies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon change its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the liquid size limit "may be the next big announcement." This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners in airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, enhancing security while potentially easing passenger inconvenience.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game provided a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, as female members of Congress from both parties played together on a single team. The game, which pits "Team Congress" against a team of female journalists, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself, the event sets aside political divisions to focus on a common cause. Participants emphasized the positive experience of coming together as women to support a cause that has personally affected many of them.</p>

          <p>Relentless and intensified immigration raids under the Trump administration are profoundly impacting life in Southern California, home to over a million undocumented immigrants. The constant threat of enforcement has driven many into hiding, afraid to work, attend school, or even go to the store, leading to deserted public spaces and canceled community events. While the administration highlights the arrest of criminals, many non-criminal residents are also being detained, fueling a fierce backlash from activists and residents. This has created a landscape of fear and social disruption, fundamentally changing the rhythm of community life in the region.</p>

          <p>A 1.5-million-year-old ice core, the oldest ever retrieved, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK for analysis. Scientists will carefully melt the ice to study the ancient dust, ash, and air bubbles trapped within, which hold vital information about Earth's climate history. This research aims to unlock secrets about a mysterious period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when the planet's ice age cycles suddenly changed. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
