          <p>An Air India flight en route to London Gatwick crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, India, resulting in the deaths of nearly all 242 passengers and crew members. The victims included Indian, British, Portuguese, and Canadian nationals, as well as local residents near the crash site. One British passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, survived the crash and received hospital treatment. Among the deceased were the Nanabawa family from Gloucester, Adam and Hasina Taju with their son-in-law, and a married couple, Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek, who ran a spiritual wellness center. The crash also claimed the lives of Vijay Rupani, the former chief minister of Gujarat, and Singson, a member of the cabin crew.

          <p>Israeli officials reported that Israel launched strikes against Iran, targeting the country's nuclear program and military leaders. According to reports, the strikes resulted in the deaths of several nuclear scientists and high-ranking military personnel. Iran responded with an aerial attack involving approximately 100 drones, but Israel claimed to have shot down all of them before they reached their targets. A U.S. official stated that the U.S. did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike. The attack marks a significant escalation in the ongoing tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Seven men in Rochdale were found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over a five-year period, during which the girls were repeatedly sexually assaulted. The victims, known as Girl A and Girl B, were groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves" by the men, who worked on the town's market or as taxi drivers. The girls, who had troubled home lives, were plied with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes by the men. The prosecution stated that the girls were "children passed around for sex, abused, degraded and then discarded." The police acknowledged that they should have done more at the time and have since improved their handling of such investigations.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli strikes on Iranian targets, including nuclear scientists and military leaders, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of a "bitter and painful" fate for Israel, with the military stating there would be "no limits" to its response. Israel claimed to have struck over 100 targets in Iran, including the Natanz uranium enrichment plant, which they claim was "significantly" damaged. Experts suggest Iran may retaliate to prevent further attacks, potentially targeting Israel's electricity and oil infrastructure. The U.S. had restarted negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, but Israel views the program as an existential threat. The IAEA condemned the attack, stating the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz had been hit.</p>

          <p>China is operating two aircraft carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, concurrently in the western Pacific for the first time, signaling an effort to coordinate vessels in open ocean. Defense analysts suggest that this tactic could be used to deter U.S. forces in a potential conflict over Taiwan. The carriers entered the western Pacific via separate routes and are believed to have practiced dispersing, concentrating, and communicating in the high seas. This operation marks the first time a Chinese carrier has crossed the strategic second island chain, which serves as a notional defensive perimeter for the U.S. and its allies.</p>

Additionally, the digest reports that the death toll from the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad has surpassed 260, and Prime Minister Ishiba is expected to speak with President Trump by phone. The Japanese government approved a policy plan targeting 1% wage growth, while the defense chief deemed China's blaming of Japan for close air encounters as "unacceptable." Lastly, Japan condemned Israel's attack on Iran for "escalating the situation."</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley announced that his effort to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) will be included in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The expansion would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste, in addition to already-qualified "downwinders." The proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits. Hawley called the inclusion a "huge step forward" and hopes it shows that the country is standing beside those affected by nuclear exposure.</p>

Trump emphasized the potential for even more brutal attacks if Iran failed to agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes but warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel.

The U.S. listing, more than 15 years in the making, faced opposition from lawmakers due to the company's past scandals. Despite the controversies, the SEC approved JBS's request to list on the New York Stock Exchange in April, and shareholders approved the move the following month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that young women, mainly from Africa, are being exploited in Russia's war factories, lured by promises of well-paid careers through the Alabuga Start program. Many find themselves assembling cheap drones under poor conditions in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone. Some women report being exposed to dangerous chemicals and forced into hard labor with low wages. The Alabuga SEZ is a major production hub for Geran-2 drones, which are used in attacks on Ukraine. Interpol is now investigating whether Alabuga Start is involved in human trafficking.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court declined to reconsider the $5 million verdict awarded to E. Jean Carroll after a jury found that President Trump sexually assaulted and defamed her. Carroll accused Trump of attacking her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s and defaming her in a 2022 social media post. Trump had argued that the trial judge erred in letting jurors review the "Access Hollywood" video and evidence of his mistreatment of other women. Trump is separately appealing an $83.3 million verdict in another defamation case brought by Carroll.</p>

Analysts suggest that the escalation could impact the global economy through higher oil prices, with the key risk being Iran's potential blocking of the Strait of Hormuz. A sustained increase in energy prices could also reverse U.S. progress in lowering inflation. Asian and European markets also sold off in overnight trading.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli strikes on Iran, Hezbollah, traditionally a key Iranian proxy, issued a statement condemning the attacks but refrained from offering to join in retaliation. Analysts suggest this restraint may stem from significant losses during a previous war with Israel or a prioritization of internal restructuring, including local arms production. Hezbollah's former leader was killed in September 2024 during an Israeli strike. Lebanon's government has also stepped up efforts to contain Hezbollah, dismantling military positions and arms depots.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized judges appointed during his first term, particularly those associated with the Federalist Society, after a federal court ruled against his tariffs. David French explains that this rift stems from Trump's expectation of loyalty from his appointees, which clashed with the judges' commitment to originalist legal philosophy. Trump was baffled that judges he appointed didn't help him steal the election. French suggests that Trump's increasing focus on personal loyalty over ideological alignment has led to this divide, and it will likely influence his judicial appointments moving forward.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly interested in signing Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo, according to sources. However, Tottenham has yet to submit a bid for Mbeumo, and other Champions League clubs have also expressed interest. Mbeumo's contract with Brentford has one year left to run, with an option to extend it by another year, and it is understood that there is no release clause. Mbeumo has scored 70 goals in 242 appearances for Brentford since joining the club in 2019.</p>
