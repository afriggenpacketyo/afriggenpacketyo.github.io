          <p>Indiana has executed Roy Lee Ward, 53, for the 2001 sexual assault and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne. This marks the state's third execution since it resumed capital punishment last year after a 15-year pause. Ward's case had been in the legal system for over two decades, and his execution proceeded despite his lawyers raising concerns about the state's lethal injection drug protocol. The victim's family expressed that justice was finally carried out, bringing a painful chapter to a close.</p>

The decision was revealed by Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar during a meeting with his Afghan counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, in India. This move upgrades India's previous "Technical Mission" in Kabul back to full embassy status. The visit by Muttaqi, a UN-sanctioned Taliban leader, marks the first high-level engagement of its kind since the regime change.</p>

Critics, including Donald Trump, have targeted the artist for his political views, support for LGBTQ+ rights, and use of Spanish in his music. Despite the controversy, which includes mistaken claims about his US citizenship, Bad Bunny's global popularity is immense, and the selection is expected to boost the NFL's international viewership.</p>

          <p>Japan's political landscape faces a significant shift as the Komeito party reportedly plans to leave the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), ending a partnership that began in 1999. The decision, announced by Komeito's chief representative, stems from dissatisfaction with the LDP's handling of political funding scandals. This development complicates the premiership bid of LDP President Takaichi Sanae, as the LDP lacks a majority in the Lower House and the split could weaken the ruling bloc's power ahead of a crucial prime ministerial vote.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's highly successful diss track, "Not Like Us." The court ruled that the lyrics, which accused Drake of being a "certified pedophile," constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle. The judge noted that listeners would not interpret the song's hyperbolic and incendiary language as verifiable facts. Drake's team plans to appeal the decision, while UMG expressed satisfaction with the outcome.</p>

          <p>JP Morgan Chase is now requiring employees at its new Manhattan headquarters to provide biometric data, such as fingerprints or eye scans, for building access. This policy, which was previously intended to be voluntary, is being implemented to enhance security at the $3 billion skyscraper. The move has raised discussions about workplace privacy and the increasing use of technology to monitor employees. While exemptions exist for some staff, the mandate reflects a broader trend among corporations to tighten security protocols.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has announced plans to accelerate the development of a multi-layered air defense system known as "T-Dome" to counter increasing threats from China.

During Taiwan's National Day celebrations, Lai urged Beijing to renounce coercion and maintain peace in the region.

          <p>Following the UK's decision to lift a ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), the country's largest investment platform, Hargreaves Lansdowne, has issued a stark warning to investors. The firm stated that it does not consider bitcoin an asset class and believes cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, advising that they should not be part of a standard investment portfolio. This cautionary stance contrasts with the government's aim to support the UK crypto industry and the growing adoption of digital assets by some major financial institutions.

          <p>Ferrari's stock plummeted over 15%, marking its worst single trading day since its public listing, after the luxury automaker issued disappointing financial guidance and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions. The company's updated revenue forecasts for 2030 fell short of analyst expectations. Additionally, Ferrari revised its 2030 sales targets to comprise only 20% fully electric vehicles, down from a previous goal of 40%, reflecting a more cautious approach to electrification amid changing market conditions.

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who described their "golden generation" of players as "egotistical losers." Rooney disagreed with the characterization, stating that the team worked hard and tried their best but "didn't quite manage to get over the line." He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different social dynamic and a more positive relationship with the media, rather than having a superior attitude, attributing past team divisions to intense club rivalries.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Landlords Using Duplicate Listings to Bypass London's Airbnb Rules</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has found that over 1,000 Airbnb listings in London appear to be duplicates created by landlords to evade the city's 90-night annual limit for short-term rentals. This rule is designed to protect the long-term housing supply, but landlords are reportedly creating multiple ads for the same property to continue renting it out year-round. Local councils describe the practice as making a "mockery" of the law, while the issue exacerbates the housing affordability crisis for residents. Airbnb stated it acts on reports of rule evasion.</p>

          <p>Councils across London will receive an additional £36.5 million in government funding this winter to address the city's growing homelessness crisis. With one in 50 Londoners currently homeless, the funds will be used for measures to prevent rough sleeping and support families living in temporary accommodation. The investment comes as new data shows a record number of deaths among the UK's homeless population in 2024. While welcoming the funding, charities have called for a more comprehensive long-term strategy to tackle the root causes of the issue.</p>

          <p>Beijing has blacklisted the Canadian semiconductor research firm TechInsights, designating it an "unreliable entity" and banning Chinese organizations from sharing information with it. The move, citing national security, came shortly after TechInsights published a report revealing that Huawei's latest AI chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China. This action could increase the opacity of China's rapidly developing but secretive chip industry and is seen as a direct response to research that challenges the narrative of complete technological self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud related to a home mortgage. The indictment was brought by a U.S. Attorney who was personally appointed by President Trump after the previous prosecutor reportedly found insufficient evidence. James, who successfully sued Trump for business fraud in New York, has called the charges "baseless" and a "desperate weaponization of our justice system" for political retribution. The move has been widely condemned by Democrats as a tyrannical abuse of power.</p>
