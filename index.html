        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European leaders, including those from Poland, the UK, France, and Germany, convened in Kyiv alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky to pressure Russia into agreeing to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, starting on Monday. The leaders emphasized the importance of reconnecting Ukraine's economy and reuniting families separated by the war, while threatening Russia with significant sanctions if it does not comply with the ceasefire. Russia has previously stated that the West must halt military aid to Ukraine before any ceasefire can be considered, but Zelensky insists that any conditions would undermine diplomacy. The planned truce would be monitored primarily by the US, with European support, and any violations would result in coordinated sanctions.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after spending 53 years in space due to a failed rocket booster, according to Roscosmos. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean near Jakarta, Indonesia, potentially remaining intact during its descent. The mission serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved several firsts in Venus exploration, including the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit data from its surface. While modern missions focus on Mars and other celestial bodies, a Japanese probe remains the only vehicle orbiting Venus, highlighting the historical significance of the Soviet efforts.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, causing tremors felt across the southern United States, including in Atlanta and parts of North Carolina. While no major damage or injuries were immediately reported, the event prompted over 23,000 public reports to the USGS within the first hour. Residents described shaking walls and rumbling sounds, a rare occurrence in East Tennessee, which is more accustomed to tornadoes and floods. The USGS noted a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the coming week, reminding residents to practice earthquake safety measures such as dropping, covering, and holding on.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is leading the U.S. delegation, while Vice Premier He Lifeng represents China, and Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed hope that Switzerland could facilitate a positive outcome for the global economy, while a swift resolution is unlikely, these initial talks may signal the beginning of a lengthy negotiation process.</p>

          <p>A bronze sculpture representing the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Butler, PA, last year has been placed on display in the Oval Office. The artwork portrays the moment when then-candidate Trump was pulled off stage by Secret Service agents after shots were fired from a nearby rooftop, an event that became a defining image of his resilience during the 2024 election. The sculpture is believed to be a maquette for a larger statue planned by artist Stan Watts of the Trump Statue Project, intended to symbolize Trump’s confidence, strength, and hope. The White House has not released a statement as to why the statue was there on that day or whether it had been presented to the president.</p>

          <p>Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital have reached a settlement agreement approaching almost a billion dollars after allegations of sexual assault by gynecologist Robert Hadden over two decades. The settlement raises questions about the institutions' inaction and whether they allowed him to continue practicing despite knowing about his behavior. Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually abuse them. Victims, including Evelyn Yang, wife of Andrew Yang, recount traumatic experiences, while attorneys representing the plaintiffs highlight a toxic culture within medical institutions that enables such abuse.</p>

          <p>Universities in Republican-led states are facing increasing pressure from both the federal government and state legislatures, resulting in funding cuts, bans on diversity initiatives, and restrictions on academic freedom. While private colleges push back against federal actions, public universities in conservative states struggle against state-level attacks that predate the Trump administration. Faculty senates are advocating for a “mutual defence compact” to support each other against repressive measures, but administrations have yet to respond. In Indiana, measures establishing “productivity” quotas for tenured faculty and ending alumni voting rights on the board of trustees highlight the challenges faced by universities in politically conservative states.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, emphasizing the importance of instinct over excessive data in decision-making. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week," and how relying on gut feelings rather than research led to successes like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He argues that overtraining on data can hinder creative and business judgments, and that a good idea should make simple common sense. Diller also shares anecdotes about recognizing promising projects and trusting his instincts to bring them to fruition.</p>

          <p>Migratory birds, essential for maintaining ecosystem balance through pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control, are increasingly affected by climate change. Rising global temperatures and extreme weather events alter their migration routes and behavior, with some shortening their journeys or abandoning traditional habitats. Changes in coastal ecosystems and ocean acidification impact food availability, reducing birds' chances of survival and reproduction. While some species adapt by expending more energy, others, like the slender-billed curlew, have become extinct, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts and international treaties to protect migratory species and their habitats.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, aimed at de-escalating tensions that have been escalating since an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir. The announcement was initially made by President Donald Trump on social media, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he and Vice President JD Vance engaged with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker the agreement. However, Indian officials stated that the ceasefire was worked out directly between the two countries. The agreement follows reports of troop movements and cross-border fire, with both sides accusing each other of provocations.</p>
