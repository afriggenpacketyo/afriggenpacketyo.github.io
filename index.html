          <p>Volodymyr Mykolaienko, former mayor of Kherson, shares his harrowing experience of three years in Russian captivity after his city's occupation in February 2022. He recounts being interrogated, tortured, and held in various penal colonies, describing Borisoglebsk as "absolute hell." Mykolaienko, who famously refused an earlier prisoner exchange to allow a seriously injured Ukrainian to take his place, also speaks of suspected treachery in Kherson's swift capture and his shock at the ongoing civilian killings by drones upon his return. He expresses immense pride in Ukrainian resilience but urges young men to contribute more to the war effort, emphasizing national victory.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates that China's central bank will likely ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter, forecasting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This projection comes as China's economic momentum slows, with year-on-year growth potentially falling towards 4% from a high base last year. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has subtly shifted its economic description, indicating a more cautious outlook despite a previously limited appetite for near-term easing. However, the data-dependent nature of PBOC decisions means no action could occur if the "around 5%" growth target remains on track. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has withdrawn from his reelection bid, citing constant media speculation about his future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions in campaign funds. His departure sets up a three-way race between Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who faced a federal corruption scandal and consistently low poll numbers, stated he was "wrongfully charged" but could not continue his campaign. His exit has prompted various reactions from rivals and acknowledgments of his public service from figures like Governor Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, despite the controversies surrounding his tenure.</p>

This strategic move, featuring a mobile, ground-based weapon system designed to defeat cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and rockets, is widely seen as a direct reply to perceived threats from China and North Korea. The deployment follows earlier reports of U.S. Army plans to send a prototype launcher to global hotspots. This enhancement of South Korea's defense capabilities signals a reinforcement of regional security alliances amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, aiming to deter potential aggression.</p>

          <p>The ongoing decline of American malls and shopping centers is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for small, local businesses, including health practitioners, artists, and independent retailers. With national vacancy rates rising to 5.8% and rent growth slowing, landlords are becoming more flexible with lease terms, offering shorter lengths, partial fit-outs, and even rent-free periods. This trend allows businesses previously priced out of prime locations to secure space, fostering local regeneration and unique community experiences. While challenges remain, particularly for landlords wary of small business failure rates and the need for "credit tenants," this shift represents a significant recalibration of the commercial property market, benefiting local entrepreneurs.</p>

A study by the Dibru-Saikhowa Conservation Society found that the four most venomous Indian snake populations are likely to shift into northern and northeastern states due to higher global temperatures and regional humidity. This anticipated shift into agricultural areas is expected to significantly increase human-snake interactions, posing dangerous and potentially fatal encounters.

          <p>USC women's basketball star JuJu Watkins announced she will miss the upcoming college basketball season to fully recover from a serious knee injury sustained during the NCAA tournament in March. Watkins, who won multiple national awards in her sophomore year and led the Trojans to a Big Ten title, stated her focus is on healing after a challenging few months. USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb confirmed the program's full support for her decision, acknowledging her vital role as a leader and teammate despite her absence on the court. While her on-court impact will be missed, the arrival of another top prospect, Jazzy Davidson, is expected to help fill some of the void for the Trojans.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has stated that while initial strategic nuclear weapons talks should be bilateral between Russia and the U.S., the arsenals of Britain and France must ultimately be included in future negotiations. This position follows a Russian proposal to the U.S. to voluntarily maintain the limits on deployed strategic nuclear weapons set out in their New START arms control treaty once it expires next year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that these arsenals are a critical component of overall global European security and strategic stability. The New START treaty, which caps deployed strategic nuclear warheads, has been suspended by Russia, though Moscow says it still observes the limits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is widely expected to hold its key policy rate at 5.50% this week, though some economists suggest a surprise cut cannot be ruled out due to concerns over U.S. trade tariffs and a subdued inflation outlook. Major banks like Citi, Barclays, and Capital Economics have flagged the possibility of a cut, citing downside risks to growth and a benign inflation outlook. While India's economy grew a stronger-than-expected 7.8% in the June quarter, private investment remains weak, and financial conditions have tightened. Economists believe the RBI might act proactively to cushion against external shocks, positioning itself as a forward-looking central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses "energy vampires" in friendships—individuals who drain your energy through excessive complaining, self-focus, or a lack of interest in your life. Psychologist Suzy Reading identifies common signs as an excessive need for attention and reassurance, or subtly undermining your mood through backhanded compliments or pressure to be upbeat. Author Radhika Sanghani suggests that how you feel after interactions is a key indicator. The article offers three strategies for handling such relationships: honest communication about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries if behavior doesn't change, and altering shared activities to reduce opportunities for dominance, such as opting for walks instead of intense chats. These steps aim to protect one's well-being in challenging friendships.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are expected to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program designed to implement sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. This unprecedented exodus comes as Congress faces a deadline to authorize more funding or risk a government shutdown, with the White House ordering agencies to prepare for large-scale firings. Workers cited "fear and intimidation," feeling they had no choice but to depart due to uncertainty, being scapegoated, and a perceived loss of mission and work-life balance under current policies. This event highlights significant morale issues within the federal government.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations for green marine fuels hinge significantly on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While Hong Kong has already implemented LNG and biodiesel fueling, green methanol requires a robust upstream-to-downstream system, including tax-free mainland-produced fuel for storage and sale. Wang's remarks coincided with the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of operating on both traditional fuel and methanol. With Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs, CM Energy expects to increase its green methanol usage from 2027, despite the fuel currently costing four times more.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, which has been universally blocked by federal courts. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government has a compelling interest in ensuring American citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled, claiming lower court decisions undermine border security and confer citizenship on "unqualified people." This action challenges over a century of settled legal precedent regarding the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, which typically applies to anyone born in the U.S. Critics, like the ACLU, call the order illegal and cruel, warning of an "earthquake" if the Supreme Court were to rule in Trump's favor.</p>
