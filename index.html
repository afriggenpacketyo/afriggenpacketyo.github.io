          <p>Rick Davies, co-founder of the British rock group Supertramp, passed away at his Long Island home at 81 after battling multiple myeloma for years. The singer-songwriter was crucial in maintaining the band after Roger Hodgson's departure in 1983, and his distinctive vocals and Wurlitzer piano became central to their sound. Davies co-wrote and sang many of Supertramp's hits, including "Goodbye Stranger" and "Bloody Well Right," leaving an indelible mark on rock music history. Beyond his musical achievements, Davies was known for his warmth and resilience, enjoying performances with his local band, Ricky and the Rockets, after health issues prevented touring with Supertramp. His enduring music and legacy continue to inspire many.</p>

          <h2>China-US Study Reveals Mars Possesses Unexpected Solid Inner Core</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 22:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new China-US study, leveraging seismic waves recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core. This core, approximately 600km in radius, constitutes about 18% of Mars’ total radius, a proportion comparable to Earth’s inner core. Scientists found this discovery unexpected, as most celestial bodies in the solar system have not cooled enough to form such a solid core, which typically requires significant time for liquid metal to "freeze" under specific pressure and temperature conditions. This finding could revive the long-debated theory that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics, adding Mars to the exclusive list of celestial bodies with solid inner cores.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, led by Japan, experienced a surge following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement over the weekend. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 climbed 1.5%, and the Topix index reached a record high, fueled by investor optimism surrounding potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, who are seen as proponents of deregulation and growth. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and Japanese government bond yields continued to rise, reflecting market concerns over persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, and future fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate a period of extended political uncertainty for Japan into Q4 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two men have been arrested in connection with a brazen wedding theft in Glendale, where a gift box containing an estimated $60,000 in cash, gift cards, and checks was stolen. Armean Shirehjini, identified as the suspected thief, and Andranik Avetisyan, the alleged getaway driver, were apprehended within five days, largely due to clear surveillance footage that went viral. During Shirehjini's arrest, a handgun was found, and multiple firearms and various drugs were seized, with detectives continuing to process evidence. While the incident deeply distressed the newlyweds, police were able to recover 26 checks and approximately $10,000 in cash, offering some resolution to the couple.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece critically examines Rahm Emanuel's assertion that China could serve as an external threat to restore American political unity, labeling it as embodying false premises underpinning the American empire. The article challenges the notion that China has ever been an enemy, or that its current stance towards the U.S. stems from the 2008 financial crisis or perceived American divisions. Instead, the author argues that American voters are responsible for their own political outcomes, such as President Trump's re-election, and that external entities cannot be blamed for internal issues. This perspective highlights a fundamental disagreement on the nature of U.S.-China relations and America's historical foreign policy drivers.</p>

He defended the detentions as necessary for illegal workers but called for a system to legally bring in experts for training. Separately, Trump walked back his "Department of WAR" comment regarding Chicago, clarifying he intends to "clean up" cities, despite FBI data showing lower crime rates in Chicago and Boston compared to some red-state cities. His administration's border tsar, Tom Homan, indicated more worksite enforcement operations are expected in sanctuary cities nationwide.</p>

Bayrou initiated the vote, hoping to "shock" politicians into addressing France's looming debt crisis, which stands at 114% of its annual economic output. His austerity budget, aiming to slash €44bn in spending, is unlikely to pass due to deep divisions following President Macron's ill-fated snap election call in 2024.

This defect could lead to an unexpected "loss of drive power," increasing the risk of a vehicle crash without prior warning. While Chrysler reported no injuries or accidents related to the issue as of mid-August, a remedy is currently being developed. Owners will be notified starting October 23, and can check their vehicle's VIN on the NHTSA website from September 11.</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, parts of Europe, and Africa witnessed a captivating "Blood Moon" on Sunday night during a total lunar eclipse. This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. The red color results from sunlight reflecting and scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily. People in Asia, particularly India and China, had the best views of this millennia-old celestial event, while Europe and Africa experienced a partial eclipse at moonrise.</p>

          <p>The United States is projected to lose approximately $30 billion in international tourism revenue this year, with foreign travel spending expected to drop significantly. This decline is attributed to the country's political environment and a strong dollar, deterring international visitors. Consequently, other nations, particularly Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Asia, are benefiting as travelers seek alternative destinations or opt for domestic travel. The U.S. share of global international travel has been steadily falling and is not expected to recover within the next decade, indicating a long-term shift in global tourism patterns.

Trump has repeatedly suggested deploying National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, despite local crime rate declines and legal challenges to such deployments.
