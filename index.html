          <p>The United States and the Houthis in Yemen have reached a deal to halt American airstrikes after the Houthis agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea, according to President Trump and Omani mediators. The New York Times article reports that while Trump announced the truce, it remains unclear whether the Houthis will fully stop impeding international shipping. The Houthis have stated they will continue to fight Israel, and some officials portray the deal as a victory for the militia. The agreement follows a costly bombing campaign by the United States.</p>
