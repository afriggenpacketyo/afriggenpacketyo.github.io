          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:09:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the first five months of President Trump's second term reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests surged by 120% compared to the same period under the previous administration. A CBS News analysis shows these more than 109,000 arrests were heavily concentrated in border and Southern states like Texas, Florida, and California. The increase follows the reversal of prior policies, granting ICE a broader mandate to arrest individuals in the U.S. illegally, regardless of their criminal history. Experts attribute the geographic focus to local law enforcement cooperation and demographic patterns.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor Through Hybridization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the modern potato is a descendant of an ancient tomato, solving a long-standing botanical mystery. A study published in the journal Cell explains that around 9 million years ago, a hybridization event occurred between an ancient tomato and a non-tuber-producing Chilean species. The tomato ancestor provided a key gene for forming tubers, while the other species contributed a gene that controls their growth. This genetic combination was essential for creating the starchy vegetable known today, highlighting how inter-species breeding can drive the evolution of new traits and species.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation has uncovered that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by purchasing oil from Iran through a clandestine network of tankers known as the "dark fleet." These ships engage in ship-to-ship oil transfers in international waters, often with their identification transponders turned off to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which primarily occurs off the coast of Malaysia, is estimated to generate billions for Iran, undermining U.S. efforts to curb the nation's nuclear program. Despite new sanctions, the activity appears to be increasing, as China does not recognize the unilateral U.S. measures.</p>

          <p>Heathrow Airport has unveiled a comprehensive £49 billion expansion and modernization plan, which it argues is urgently needed to address capacity issues. The proposal, funded by private finance, includes a third runway, a new terminal, and significant infrastructure changes like diverting a section of the M25 motorway. While business groups support the plan for its potential to boost the UK economy and connectivity, it faces strong opposition from environmental organizations, the Mayor of London, and local residents over concerns about pollution, noise, and climate impact.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is reportedly facing demands from the United States to commit to a massive investment package of up to US$400 billion to avoid a looming 32 percent tariff. This potential concession is being considered as a way for the island to qualify for a lower tariff tier, similar to arrangements made with Japan and South Korea. The situation has sparked considerable anxiety in Taiwan, as the requested amount is equivalent to approximately four years of its central government's budget. Analysts suggest the U.S. pressure may be a strategic move to manage regional tensions amid ongoing trade negotiations with Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

The victims, who are all related, include a 15-year-old boy. The case is connected to an infant who was found abandoned in a car seat on a stranger's lawn and is also related to the victims. Drummond is considered armed and dangerous and is wanted for first-degree murder, kidnapping, and firearm charges.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order detailing updated tariff rates for more than 65 countries and the European Union, formalizing its new trade regime. While the implementation deadline was previously set for August 1, the new rates will take effect in seven days for most nations, with some exceptions for countries like Canada and Mexico, where negotiations are ongoing. The order also imposes an additional 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped through other countries to evade duties. Countries not explicitly listed will face a default additional tariff rate of 10%.</p>

          <p>In the first federal jury trial of its kind, plaintiffs are seeking approximately $345 million in damages from Tesla over a fatal 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot system. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Naibel Benavides, who was killed, and Dillon Angulo, who was severely injured when a Tesla Model S struck them while its owner was using Enhanced Autopilot. The plaintiffs argue that Tesla's marketing overstated the system's capabilities, leading to driver over-reliance, and that the technology had dangerous defects. Tesla's defense contends that the driver was at fault for the collision.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major economic engines in China's southern Guangdong province, are reporting an economic slowdown, signaling potential trouble for the region.

In Shenzhen, fixed-asset investment and real estate development have both seen double-digit declines year-on-year.

          <h2>FICO CEO Defends Credit Score Pricing Amid Criticism from Federal Housing Regulator</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fair Isaac (FICO) CEO Will Lansing has pushed back against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regarding the cost of his company's credit scores. In a recent interview, Lansing argued that the $4.95 price for a mortgage score is a very small part of overall closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. His comments follow the FHFA's decision to allow mortgage lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore and sharp criticism from the agency's head, who called FICO a monopoly. Lansing defended his company's model as the industry standard and expressed safety concerns about the new policy.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant and the city's oldest, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days following an overwhelming outpouring of community support. Since the closure was announced, the establishment has seen massive lines of customers wanting one last meal, with sales jumping dramatically. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service while he actively seeks a new buyer who will respect the landmark's legacy. While grateful for the surge, Moses expressed that the business model for restaurants in the city remains challenging.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new tariff strategy has successfully forced trade deals and imposed duties without causing the immediate market panic seen in previous attempts. While the White House claims victory, this new global trade landscape comes with significant long-term risks and consequences. The approach has shifted global supply chains and prompted traditional allies to seek new economic alliances, potentially eroding America's central role in the global economy over time. For now, the worst-case recession scenarios have been avoided, but the full impact on U.S. consumers and international relations remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's fiercely competitive on-demand food delivery sector is seeing a new wave of investment as major players build centralized kitchens to streamline operations. Market leader Meituan plans to launch 1,200 "Raccoon Restaurants," which are food court-style hubs for takeaway-only restaurant chains, aiming to cut costs and boost efficiency. Meanwhile, rival JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own self-operated kitchens over the next three years.

          <p>Colombia experienced a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, reversing a positive trend. According to government data, the Amazon rainforest was the most heavily impacted area, accounting for over 65% of the nearly 281,000 acres of forest destroyed. Authorities attribute the spike to factors like land grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, cultivation of illicit crops, and wildfires exacerbated by drought. The increase marks a substantial setback for the environmentally critical region, though overall deforestation remains below 2021 levels.</p>

The outcome is a significant win for the tech industry and its investors, especially after a prolonged IPO drought.
