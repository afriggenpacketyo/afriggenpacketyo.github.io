          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, BfV, has officially classified the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as an extremist entity after an extensive review. The agency stated that the AfD's concept of national identity, rooted in ethnicity and ancestry, is incompatible with Germany's democratic order. The BfV contends that the AfD aims to exclude specific population groups from equal participation in society, subjecting them to discriminatory treatment that violates constitutional principles and assigns them a legally subordinate status. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser reinforced this by stating that the AfD views citizens with immigrant backgrounds as second-class Germans, reflecting a racist attitude particularly against immigrants and Muslims.</p>

          <p>Russell Brand attended Westminster Magistrates' Court in London for the initial hearing regarding multiple charges of sexual assault. The charges include one count of sexual assault, one of indecent assault, one of oral sexual assault, and two further counts of sexual assault, involving four separate women and alleged offenses between 1999 and 2005. Brand, who denies all charges, made no statement to reporters as he entered the court, surrounded by bodyguards and a throng of photographers. The New York Times article notes that this appearance marks the beginning of what is expected to be a lengthy legal process, with a plea hearing anticipated in about a month and the actual trial potentially a year away due to court backlogs.</p>

He has previously served as prime minister under Yoon Suk Yeol and Roh Moo-hyun, as well as trade minister, finance minister, and ambassador to the US.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the enduring relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail." Eig emphasizes that King's message was rooted in the belief that love has the power to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems. King's protests in Birmingham aimed to condemn segregation laws and call Americans to action, believing that government leaders and ordinary citizens would choose mercy over meanness if they witnessed injustice firsthand. Eig suggests that King's letter offers a pathway for those who disapprove of current tactics and wish to fight back against cruelty, advocating for determined legal and nonviolent pressure to achieve civil rights gains.</p>

          <p>Community kitchens in Gaza are warning that food supplies will run out within days due to the ongoing Israeli blockade, which has prevented essential goods from entering the region for two months. Sami Matar, who leads the Anera team, reports that the kitchens are struggling to provide basic meals to hundreds of thousands of Gazans who rely on them for sustenance. The UN and other agencies have used up all their food aid stocks, leading to growing international pressure on Israel to lift the blockade and avert mass starvation. The situation is dire, with many families unable to afford or find food in local markets.</p>

They argue that Bernstein would have wanted his music to be heard, as he believed in its power to unite and uplift all Americans. They note that Bernstein himself faced pressures to curtail his artistic activity in the past, but he always chose to play music, believing in its ability to transcend violence and hate. The proceeds from upcoming Kennedy Center performances will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

          <p>Kellyanne Conway, in an opinion piece for Fox News, criticizes the Democratic Party for what she views as numerous missteps during President Trump's first 100 days in office. She asserts that the Democratic Party is in disarray and out of touch with most Americans, citing low approval ratings and internal divisions. Conway points to specific instances, such as Democrats' reactions to Trump's Joint Address to Congress and their stances on various social and political issues, as evidence of their disconnect. She concludes that Democrats are more focused on future presidential elections than on addressing the country's current needs.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks is gaining momentum, fueled by support from President Trump and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Recent stock trades by lawmakers around tariff announcements have raised concerns about potential insider trading, prompting renewed calls for reform. Legislation to bar lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks has been introduced in both the House and Senate, with proponents arguing that it would reduce conflicts of interest and restore public trust. While some lawmakers express concerns about the impact on their ability to save for retirement, supporters emphasize that serving in Congress is a privilege that should not be used for personal financial gain.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered into a $5.3 billion agreement with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a next-generation amylin analog for weight loss. This deal marks Roche's latest effort to compete in the expanding obesity drug market against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Petrelintide could offer superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs. The two companies will co-develop petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset CT-388, with Zealand receiving upfront payments and potential milestone payments.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling a potential shift in British politics. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, won by a mere six votes, seizing a traditionally Labour-held seat. This victory could indicate a growing influence for Reform in upcoming local council elections. The outcome has delivered a blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Labour Party, and may accelerate a shift toward a more polarized, multiparty system in Britain.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the historical significance of horses and questions the ethics of modern horse racing, where horses often suffer fatal injuries for sport and profit. The author, a former racehorse rider, acknowledges the sacrifices horses have made for human advancement and criticizes the racing industry's exploitation of these animals. The author argues that despite claims of improved safety, the sport remains inherently cruel and that society should evolve away from it. It suggests that continuing to tolerate a sport that routinely kills horses exposes humanity's backwardness and lack of empathy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at cutting public funding for NPR and PBS, accusing them of bias. NPR and PBS receive a portion of their funding from US taxpayers through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), but rely more heavily on private donations. The order instructs the CPB board and all executive departments to cease federal funding, arguing that the entities do not provide a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events. It is unclear how this will affect the broadcasters, as the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027.</p>
