          <p>Major Chinese tech companies, including Alibaba and Meituan, are engaged in an intense battle for dominance in the 'instant commerce' sector, which promises delivery of goods in as little as 30 minutes. This competition has led to significant consumer subsidies, with some meals costing as little as one US dollar and even new iPhone 17 models being offered for rapid delivery. The market has evolved beyond just food, now encompassing a wide range of retail products and transforming consumer expectations for speed and convenience. This high-stakes rivalry is reshaping China's retail landscape by blurring the lines between online platforms and traditional brick-and-mortar stores.</p>

          <p>The Connecticut Republican Party has condemned Farmington Board of Education Chairman Bill Beckert for a social media post reacting to the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Beckert allegedly reposted a comment stating, "They Reap What They Sow," which the state's GOP chairman, Ben Proto, called a "grotesque" celebration of political violence. Proto argued that such a reaction is a betrayal of the values an educator should embody and sets a dangerous example for children. The incident is one of several where public figures have faced backlash for their online responses to Kirk's assassination, highlighting deep political polarization.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 21:39:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in Downing Street and the Foreign Office were reportedly aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended him. Sources indicate that while Starmer himself was not aware of the email contents during Prime Minister's Questions, his offices had received a media inquiry detailing them the previous day. Mandelson was subsequently dismissed as UK ambassador to the US after the emails were published, revealing he had offered strong support to Epstein in 2008. The handling of the situation has increased political pressure on Starmer and raised questions about the vetting process for high-profile appointments.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stated that dozens of political prisoners recently freed in a US-brokered deal were forcibly deported from the country. While celebrating their release, she emphasized that the act was not one of true freedom, as the individuals were exiled to Lithuania without their consent, some nearing the end of their sentences anyway. The release of 52 prisoners was part of an agreement to lift US sanctions on Belarus's national airline. Tsikhanouskaya is now urging Western governments to pressure authoritarian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko to allow these political prisoners the right to remain in their homeland.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their super-fight in Las Vegas, Terence Crawford and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez both successfully made weight, with Crawford moving up two divisions to match the champion at 167.5 pounds. The bout at Allegiant Stadium will see Alvarez defend his undisputed super-middleweight titles against the undefeated Crawford, who aims to become the first male boxer to be an undisputed champion in three different weight classes. The ceremonial weigh-in was dominated by a pro-Alvarez crowd, though Crawford appeared composed. Experts are divided, with many citing Crawford's adaptability and ring intelligence as key factors against Alvarez's natural power and experience at this weight.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled Missouri legislature has passed a new congressional redistricting plan, which is expected to be signed into law by Governor Mike Kehoe. The redrawn map is designed to give Republicans a 7-1 advantage in the state's U.S. House delegation by altering the Kansas City-area district currently held by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver. This mid-decade redistricting effort, encouraged by former President Trump, follows similar moves in other states as Republicans aim to solidify their narrow House majority ahead of midterm elections. Opponents immediately filed a lawsuit, arguing the new map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that violates state requirements for compact districts.</p>

          <p>A new Harvard study has found a significant correlation between experiences of violence and a higher risk of heart disease in women. The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 female nurses over two decades, revealed that women who had been stalked had a 41% higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The risk was even greater, at 70% higher, for women who had obtained a restraining order against someone. Researchers controlled for other factors like diet and exercise, concluding that the stress from these traumatic experiences directly contributes to adverse cardiovascular health, suggesting such experiences should be considered alongside traditional risk factors.</p>

          <p>This autumn offers several opportunities for sky-gazers to observe notable celestial events as the nights grow longer. The astronomical season begins with the equinox on September 22nd, but a day prior, Saturn will be at its brightest and closest to Earth in an event known as 'opposition.' While the planet will be visible to the naked eye, a telescope will be needed to see its famous rings. Later in the season, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will peak around October 22nd, with ideal viewing conditions expected due to the new moon minimizing light pollution.</p>

Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita claim they were moved against their will in late 2023 after their religious community was dissolved. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they re-entered their former apartments, which initially had no electricity or water. Church authorities have called the move "incomprehensible," citing the nuns' health, but the women insist they are happy to be home and are now receiving support from the local community.</p>

A CBS News analysis found that X's AI chatbot, Grok, repeatedly misidentified the suspect before an official announcement and generated altered images of the man sought by the FBI. Other AI systems, including Google's AI Overview and Perplexity, also produced inaccurate or contradictory information about the event.

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk played a significant role in mobilizing younger voters, particularly young men, to support Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Through his organization, Turning Point USA, Kirk focused on a strategy to shift the youth vote, which has historically favored Democrats. Exit poll data indicates that Trump improved his performance with voters under 30 compared to previous elections, narrowing the gap with his Democratic opponent. Polling experts credit Kirk with not only organizing this demographic but also persuading the Republican establishment to invest in reaching them, contributing to key victories in swing states.</p>

The analysis indicates that barriers such as a lack of awareness, the complexity of the application process, and social stigma prevent people from accessing benefits like universal credit and pension credit. This unclaimed support also includes local authority aid and social tariffs from utility providers. While the government says it promotes these benefits, experts argue that the system's complexity inadvertently withholds crucial aid from those who need it most, including pensioners and low-income families.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Plan to End EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 19:26:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced its intention to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, a rule in place since 2009 that requires over 8,000 industrial facilities to report their emissions. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the move would save businesses billions in regulatory costs without violating the Clean Air Act, calling the data collection unnecessary. However, environmental experts and former EPA officials argue that ending the program would blind the public and policymakers to critical pollution data needed to address climate change. Health advocates also expressed concern, saying that measuring pollution is a vital step in protecting public health from climate-driven emergencies.</p>

          <p>Sean Astin, widely known for his role as Samwise Gamgee in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, has been elected the new national president of SAG-AFTRA. He will lead the 160,000-member performers' union as it prepares for critical contract negotiations with major studios next year. Astin, who succeeds Fran Drescher, secured 79% of the vote and will face challenges including industry consolidation and the rise of artificial intelligence. Astin, whose mother Patty Duke was also a past president of the guild, has stated his goal is to achieve a fair deal with studios and protect the legacy of the gains made during last year's historic strike.</p>

          <p>A new report from Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives has identified approximately 50 US-China joint educational programs as "high-risk" and is calling for their termination. The report targets partnerships like those between New York University and East China Normal University, and Johns Hopkins and Tsinghua University. This move represents an escalation in efforts to curb academic collaborations over fears they could aid Beijing's military and technological ambitions. The criteria for a "high-risk" designation include any institutional links to China's defense sector or military-focused entities, signaling a growing push to decouple aspects of American and Chinese academia.</p>

          <p>Artist Andres Serrano, famous for his controversial 1987 work 'Piss Christ,' has offered insights into two of his most high-profile subjects: Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump. Serrano photographed Epstein in 2019, just months before his death, in exchange for a 16th-century sculpture, describing the financier as an uninteresting man who "collected people." In contrast, he photographed Trump in 2004 and found him to be a "fascinating" and "really smart guy." As scrutiny of the past links between the two men intensifies, Serrano's unique perspective provides a rare glimpse into their personalities from someone who captured their portraits.</p>

Despite paying taxes and being integrated into her community, she and her family are now planning to return to Mexico, a country she barely knows. Her story reflects the widespread anxiety in immigrant communities as policies shift from tolerance to aggressive deportation efforts, affecting families with deep roots in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to end humanitarian parole protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision lifts a lower court's stay, allowing the administration to terminate the Biden-era policies that had granted these individuals legal status and work authorization for two years. While the ruling is a victory for the administration's efforts to dismantle previous immigration pathways, legal advocates for the migrants expressed deep disappointment. They argued the move cruelly forces people who followed government rules to choose between leaving their new lives or returning to danger.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing giant engages in systemic discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The lawsuit claims that Uber drivers frequently refuse service to individuals with service animals, illegally charge cleaning fees for shedding, and deny requests to store mobility devices. According to the Justice Department, this has caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be stranded. Uber responded that it prohibits such discrimination and takes action against drivers who violate its accessibility policies, but the government is seeking $125 million for those who have filed complaints.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation aimed at addressing the state's housing crisis by allowing for denser housing development near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, overrides local zoning laws to permit buildings of up to nine stories adjacent to major transit stops. Proponents argue that building near existing infrastructure is a smart solution to the housing shortage, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local control. The bill's passage was secured after amendments were added to include union hiring requirements for certain projects.</p>
