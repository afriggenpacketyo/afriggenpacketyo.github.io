          <p>Cynthie Jane Ragsdale, a dedicated camp director, tragically died in the recent Texas floods that claimed over 100 lives. Her brother, Jeeper Ragsdale, recounted Jane's desperate 3:30 a.m. call on July 4th, alerting him to the rapidly rising water at her camp. Despite her own peril, Jane's warning enabled her brother to save at least five lives at his own camp. Her selflessness and lifelong commitment to the camp are remembered by her family.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is investing $400 million in MP Materials, the sole operational rare earth mine in the U.S., making it its largest shareholder. This strategic public-private partnership aims to expand domestic rare earth processing and magnet production, crucial for military systems like the F-35 warplane. The move seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign, primarily Chinese, rare earth imports, bolstering national security and economic self-reliance. MP Materials' shares surged by 50% following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

The search continues for Decker, who vanished after his daughters' bodies were found with plastic bags over their heads and hands bound. The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, aged 17 to 20, have been arrested by the National Crime Agency (NCA) in connection with the cyberattacks that significantly disrupted M&S and Co-op. The suspects face charges including Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail, and money laundering. The hacks, which began in mid-April, stole private data and deployed ransomware, causing M&S to estimate £300 million in lost profits. The NCA described the arrests as a 'significant step' in the ongoing investigation.</p>

The Education Department has threatened Columbia's accreditation and canceled $400 million in grants due to perceived inaction on antisemitism.

          <p>The Grateful Dead, with sound engineer Owsley 'Bear' Stanley, attempted to revolutionize live music in the 1970s with their colossal 'Wall of Sound.' This utopian project aimed to provide pristine audio for every audience member by placing all technology behind the band. Despite its innovative concept, the massive system, weighing 'a dozen full-grown elephants' and featuring nearly 600 speakers, proved unwieldy, expensive, and prone to glitches. Its complexity ultimately contributed to the band's burnout and eventual hiatus, highlighting the tension between innovation and practicality in performance.</p>
