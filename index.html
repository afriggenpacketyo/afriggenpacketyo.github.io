          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles following large-scale protests sparked by ICE operations. President Trump criticized California's Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Bass, stating that the federal government would intervene due to their alleged inability to manage the situation. Governor Newsom responded by calling the deployment inflammatory and unnecessary, while Mayor Bass stated that city officials are working with law enforcement to find the best path forward. The deployment raises questions about federal authority and the Posse Comitatus Act as protesters clash with authorities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italy is holding a referendum to potentially halve the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, a move supported by civil society groups. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and urging citizens to abstain from voting. The referendum aims to integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the economy and their children, but faces opposition from right-wing parties concerned about national identity. The outcome of the referendum could affect up to 1.4 million people and influence Italy's approach to immigration and integration. The future of citizenship in Italy hangs in the balance.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has indicated a willingness to deepen dialogue with other nations regarding export controls on rare earth minerals, approving some export applications.

China, recognizing its role as a responsible major power, is taking into account the legitimate civilian needs of other countries. This development is significant amid ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, where rare earths are a key point of discussion.

She believes flexible working options are crucial for retaining teachers, particularly new parents, in the profession. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has also advocated for more schools to offer flexible hours to address recruitment and retention challenges.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's alleged self-dealing is more alarming than previously thought, as it transforms the political system into one that serves the leader's personal interests. The author draws parallels to Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary, where leaders have used their power to enrich themselves and their associates. The piece suggests that the fusion of political and personal interests poses a fundamental danger to American democracy. Checks and balances are being weakened, leading to a system where the nation's interests are indistinguishable from its leader's.</p>

          <p>President Trump is deploying federal force in California, leading to accusations of "sowing chaos" from Governor Gavin Newsom. The decision to send the National Guard was made without consulting the state governor, escalating tensions. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to mobilize active-duty Marines, prompting further criticism from Newsom. The president defended his actions, citing the need to solve the problem if local authorities cannot, while the Los Angeles Police Department reported peaceful demonstrations. The situation reflects a growing divide between California and the federal government.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them "super vision," enabling them to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, demonstrates the potential for treating human blindness. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, replacing photoreceptor cells in the retina. The advance offers hope for restoring vision to those with retinal damage. The study highlights the potential of rare minerals in medical applications.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not valid forms of identification for boarding domestic flights. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The TSA's Facebook post humorously emphasized that while they appreciate Costco's offerings, membership cards do not meet federal ID requirements. The confusion likely stems from the presence of stars on Costco cards, similar to the markings on REAL ID-compliant cards.

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce greater long-term fertility gains than subsidizing mothers alone. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce. The study highlights the need to address traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women. The new approach could change the course of China's demographic trajectory.</p>

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular food habit, may be an eating disorder in disguise, especially for individuals with a history of disordered eating. The practice can provide a socially acceptable cover for restrictive eating, as it requires skipping meals and ignoring hunger cues. Experts emphasize that intermittent fasting increases the risk of developing eating disorders, which have significant psychiatric and medical consequences. They recommend intuitive eating that listens to hunger and fullness cues, rather than adhering to rigid food rules. Those with a fragile relationship with food or a history of eating disorders should avoid intermittent fasting.</p>
