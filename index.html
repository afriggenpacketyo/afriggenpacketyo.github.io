          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has issued a warning about the escalating U.S. debt and deficits, suggesting investors should be wary of the government bond market. He likens the situation to a doctor observing a critically ill patient, indicating that the U.S. faces a severe financial challenge within the next three years. Dalio points out that the deficit is unsustainable, exceeding what the market can bear, and expresses pessimism about politicians' ability to bridge their differences and alleviate the country's debt burden. The yield on the 30-year Treasury has reached levels not seen since 2023, reflecting rising financing costs and continued spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to prevent Harvard University from enrolling new international students and retaining current ones, citing "pro-terrorist conduct" and accusing the university of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows colleges to enroll foreign students. Harvard has denounced the action as unlawful and retaliatory, asserting its commitment to its international students, who comprise over 27% of the student body. A federal judge has issued an injunction that could block the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation. Unlike previous rallies, this climb has been gradual, influenced by factors such as easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration, including potential regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, have also contributed to the positive momentum. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a previous bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will now allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has largely reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, following a Pentagon review that utilized standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial ban, which included works by authors like Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi, was based on the Navy's own search terms. The new review, employing DOD's criteria, identified only about 20 books requiring removal pending further evaluation by a Defense Department panel. This reversal comes after a Pentagon memo directed military services to remove DEI-related books, aligning with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>A White House report, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., attributes a crisis of chronic illness among American children to factors including ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, and excessive use of prescription drugs. The report calls for more research into the causes of disease and prevention, while also raising concerns about corporate influence in federal policymaking and the overmedicalization of children. While the report suggests potential harm from routine immunizations, it also acknowledges that vaccines benefit children by protecting them from infectious diseases. The report reflects Mr. Kennedy's views and proposes new initiatives for the National Institutes of Health.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential risks associated with annuities, examining whether these retirement products can run out of money. While immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide guaranteed income for life, fixed-term, variable, and indexed annuities, as well as those with withdrawal riders, can deplete funds if not managed carefully. The stability of the issuing insurer is also a critical factor, as annuity payments are only as secure as the company's financial health. Diversifying retirement income, choosing a lifetime income annuity, and researching the insurance company are recommended strategies to mitigate the risk of outliving annuity payments.

Experts suggest that addressing the subminimum wage and expanding the standard deduction would be more effective in supporting low-wage workers. The subminimum wage, currently at $2.13 per hour, contributes to poverty among tipped workers, and a more comprehensive approach is needed to improve their financial well-being.</p>

          <p>The cricket community is discussing whether to allow injury replacements in Test cricket, particularly in the first innings, to avoid matches being ruined due to a team being a player down. While some argue that substitutes would improve fairness and entertainment, others raise concerns about proving genuine injuries and potential abuse of the system. Former players and commentators propose solutions like an independent doctor's assessment and limiting substitutes to the first innings. There is a consensus that any system must prevent teams from faking injuries to gain a tactical advantage.</p>

          <p>A new report led by Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. presents a concerning outlook on American children's health, calling for examination of vaccines, ultra-processed foods, environmental chemicals, and "overmedicalization." The report, resulting from a Trump executive order, highlights chronic disease concerns but overlooks leading causes of death for children, such as firearms and motor vehicle accidents. While the report summarizes scientific evidence on nutrition and mental health, it emphasizes issues of concern for Kennedy, such as fluoride in water and electromagnetic radiation. Critics note the report's bias and the administration's actions that contradict the health of Americans.</p>

          <p>Oscar Smith, 75, was executed by lethal injection in Tennessee for the 1989 murders of his estranged wife and her two sons. Smith maintained his innocence, stating that "the justice system doesn't work" before the execution. He was convicted of fatally stabbing and shooting Judith Smith and her sons, Jason and Chad Burnett. Despite some new DNA evidence, requests to reopen his case were denied. The execution marked the resumption of Tennessee executions after a five-year pause due to COVID-19 and procedural issues.</p>
