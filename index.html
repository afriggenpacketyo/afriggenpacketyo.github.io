          <h2>PayPal Stock Declines as Slowing Profitability Metric Overshadows Earnings Beat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:14:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PayPal's stock fell over 8% despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The decline was attributed to slowing growth in transaction margin dollars, a crucial measure of profitability, which raised concerns among investors. While the company saw a 2% rise in active accounts to 438 million and raised its full-year earnings forecast, this was overshadowed by increased operating expenses and a significant drop in adjusted free cash flow. The market's reaction highlights worries about the company's core profitability trends amid its ongoing strategic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, killed four people and then himself in a Manhattan office building. New York's mayor stated the attacker left a note blaming the National Football League (NFL) for a brain disease, CTE, and appeared to be targeting the league's headquarters but went to the wrong office. The victims included an on-duty police officer, a Blackstone employee, and two other civilians, with an NFL employee also seriously injured. The incident prompted a massive police response and has drawn attention to the long-term health impacts of contact sports.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows President Trump's Job Approval Has Significantly Declined Among Young Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:11:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump's job approval rating among Americans aged 18-29 has dropped from 55% to 28%, a decline more than double that of any other age group. This shift is most pronounced among less partisan and politically independent young voters, particularly young men. Polling data suggests the souring sentiment is linked to economic concerns, with majorities now feeling his policies are making them financially worse off and that the administration is not focusing enough on lowering prices. The trend reverses his improved 2024 electoral performance with this demographic, posing potential challenges for Republicans in the 2026 midterms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Faustin-Archange Touadéra of the Central African Republic is set to run for a third term after a controversial 2023 referendum removed the two-term limit and extended the presidential mandate. The move has been denounced by opposition parties and civil society groups, who boycotted the referendum and allege fraud, fearing it could allow Touadéra to remain in power for life. Amid growing distrust and concerns about the integrity of the upcoming 2025 election, the opposition is demanding a national dialogue before the electoral process continues. The nation remains impoverished despite its natural resources, struggling with persistent civil conflict.</p>

          <p>The Nuremberg Zoo in Germany has faced significant public and activist outcry after euthanizing 12 healthy Guinea baboons.

They claimed that efforts to transfer the animals to other zoos or use contraception had failed, leaving them with no other option. Animal rights groups have condemned the culling as a result of "irresponsible and unsustainable breeding policies" and are threatening legal action against the zoo's management.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to Scotland yielded a significant trade deal with the European Union, which will see the EU purchase billions in US energy and military equipment in exchange for a 15% tariff rate.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, now projecting 3% growth in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026.

The IMF noted that this "front-loading" of trade provided a short-term boost but carries risks of future slowdowns.

The victims, Clinton and Cristen Brink, were found dead on a walking trail while hiking with their two young daughters, who were unharmed. The family stated the couple "died heroes, protecting their little girls." Authorities have released a composite sketch of a man seen in the park and a description of the suspect, who was carrying a black backpack and driving a black four-door sedan. The investigation is ongoing, with police appealing to the public for any relevant photos or camera footage from the area.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Maintain Interest Rates Despite Presidential Pressure for a Cut</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's public calls for lower interest rates, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its upcoming meeting. Economists cite the resilient labor market and the potential inflationary impact of new tariffs as key reasons for the central bank's cautious stance. The Fed has kept its rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range since December 2024 to manage inflation. While some Fed governors have signaled a desire for a cut, the consensus remains that policymakers will wait for more data, with a potential rate reduction seen as more likely at the September meeting.

          <p>A recent article highlights several factors driving strong investor interest in Nvidia, which recently surpassed a $4 trillion market capitalization. Key reasons cited include surging confidence in the company's dominance of AI infrastructure and anticipation for its next-generation Blackwell Ultra products, expected in 2025. The company's resilience, demonstrated by its ability to absorb financial shocks from Chinese export restrictions while still posting record revenue, is also noted as a major strength. Furthermore, the explosive growth in its data center revenue, which jumped 73% year-over-year, positions Nvidia to capitalize on the rapidly expanding global demand for AI computing power.

          <p>Shane Tamura, the 27-year-old gunman who killed four people in a New York office building, was a former standout high school football player in Southern California. He played varsity football at two different high schools, where former coaches and teammates remembered him as a quiet, hard-working, and talented athlete. It is unclear what Tamura did after graduating in 2016, but he was most recently living in Las Vegas and had a documented mental health history. The new details about his past add a complex layer to the investigation into his motive for the attack, which he linked to a football-related brain injury.</p>

          <p>Following a suggestion from President Trump, Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a bill to send tariff rebate checks directly to American families. The proposed legislation would provide at least $600 per adult and child, funded by revenue from the administration's new tariffs on imported goods. The idea is to return money to households to offset the higher prices they may face due to the trade policy. However, the proposal faces questions about its potential impact on the federal deficit and whether it could exacerbate inflation, with some policy experts suggesting the revenue would be better used for deficit reduction.

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry has strongly criticized the Trump administration's plan to impose a 15% tariff on medicines imported from the EU. A leading trade organization described the tax as a "blunt instrument" that would disrupt supply chains, hinder research investment, and ultimately harm patients in both the U.S. and Europe. The move represents a potential breach of a long-standing World Trade Organization agreement that keeps medicines and their ingredients tariff-free. This development adds to the confusion surrounding the new U.S.-EU trade deal, as EU officials had previously stated that pharmaceuticals would be exempt from new duties.</p>

          <p>With a record number of certificates of deposit (CDs) maturing in 2025, savers face a key decision on where to place their funds next. Experts advise against passively allowing CDs to auto-renew, as current rates are likely lower than when the accounts were opened. Instead, savers should proactively compare options, such as opening a new CD with a different term or at a different institution, moving the money to a more liquid high-yield savings account, or investing it elsewhere. Although CD rates have fallen, they remain historically high, and locking in a guaranteed return now could be a smart move before potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
