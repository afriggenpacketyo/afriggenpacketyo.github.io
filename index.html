          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) executed a large-scale operation targeting four Russian military airfields, reportedly damaging over 40 military aircraft used in attacks against Ukrainian cities. The attacks, planned for over a year and a half, involved drones concealed in mobile houses with retractable roofs. Russian officials acknowledged the attacks, stating that several aircraft caught fire, but claimed the attacks were repelled in some regions with no casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the operation as a success, noting its significance in the history of the conflict, as peace talks are scheduled to resume in Turkey. Optimism surrounding this event is tempered by the ongoing conflict and uncertainty regarding the talks.</p>

          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 led England to a three-wicket victory over West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series. Root became England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, surpassing Eoin Morgan's record. West Indies set a target of 308, propelled by Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope, but England's sloppy fielding aided their efforts.

          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring short-term Treasury bonds, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy, due to concerns about the economy and volatility in the market. The 3-month T-Bill offers attractive annualized yields, attracting significant investor flows into ultrashort bond ETFs. Berkshire Hathaway has doubled its ownership of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. This trend reflects a preference for stability and lower volatility in the shorter end of the fixed-income market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Budget Chief Dismisses Fears of Benefit Cuts Leading to Deaths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 12:00:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House budget director Russ Vought dismissed concerns that cuts to benefits in the spending bill passed by the House would lead to premature deaths as “totally ridiculous.” The bill, which slashes Medicaid and Snap, has drawn criticism from advocacy groups who argue that the cuts will cause great hardship. Vought defended the bill, claiming it will “preserve and protect” the social safety net while making it more “commonsense,” while Democrats condemned the cuts.</p>
