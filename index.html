          <p>Senator Adam Schiff is facing renewed scrutiny over allegations of leaking classified information, following the declassification of a 2017 FBI report containing a whistleblower's testimony. The report claims a former Democratic staffer on the House Intelligence Committee told the FBI that Schiff approved the release of derogatory classified information to undermine then-President Trump. Schiff has categorically denied these claims, calling them baseless smears from a disgruntled former staffer. This recent development echoes a pattern of similar accusations made against Schiff over the years by political opponents, including former President Trump and other administration officials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of U.S. adults who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low in the survey's nearly 90-year history. This decline coincides with a significant shift in public perception, as a record-high 53% of adults now believe that even moderate drinking is detrimental to one's health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. The trend is most pronounced among young adults, who are increasingly skeptical of alcohol's supposed benefits and are drinking less frequently. This change reflects a growing scientific consensus on alcohol's health risks, including its link to cancer.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Financial experts explain that when the Federal Reserve cuts its key interest rate, the prime rate typically follows, leading to lower interest charges on variable-rate loans like Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). However, the timing for when borrowers see reduced payments can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule, billing cycles, and specific loan features like interest-only periods or rate floors. Homeowners are advised to understand their specific loan terms and budget for potential rate fluctuations in either direction to manage their debt effectively in a changing economic environment.

          <p>One year after the brutal sexual assault and murder of a young female doctor in a Kolkata hospital sparked nationwide protests, many safety initiatives have been only partially implemented. The West Bengal government introduced measures like restricted work hours and enhanced security, and the sole suspect was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. However, activists and doctors report that significant safety gaps remain, and the 'Reclaim the Night' movement has lost momentum. The victim's family has also alleged police harassment, raising doubts about whether institutional changes have truly improved safety for women.</p>

The article reviews several conflicts where Trump claims credit for peace, including those between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. While the administration's interventions did lead to ceasefires or de-escalations in some cases, the report notes that many of these agreements are fragile, and in some instances, hostilities have continued or resumed, questioning the characterization of these conflicts as definitively 'ended'.</p>

Key indicators to watch include inflation reports like the CPI and PCE, as well as labor market data, which guide the Fed's actions. Additionally, investor demand for mortgage-backed securities and the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond serve as important benchmarks for mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

With mass detentions and deportations increasing, many migrant workers, who form a crucial part of the agricultural workforce, have either left the state or are in hiding. Farmers report being unable to hire enough workers through the H2A visa program to compensate for the loss, leading them to scale back operations.

          <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell is set to step down next year, with COO Michael Fiddelke named as his successor. The leadership change comes as the retail giant struggles with weak sales and an ongoing customer boycott related to its scaling back of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The company's retreat on these programs, following pressure from conservative activists, created a backlash from other consumer groups. Target has reported declining comparable sales and a significant drop in net income, citing reduced consumer spending and the impact of the boycotts on its performance.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart surged over 12% after the company announced a nearly 400% increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. The remarkable growth was driven by the global popularity of its Labubu dolls, a line of 'ugly-cute' plushies that have become a viral sensation. The company's revenue jumped over 200% to $1.93 billion, far exceeding previous forecasts. Despite concerns about the longevity of its intellectual property and potential regulatory scrutiny over its 'blind box' sales model, the company's CEO expressed confidence in hitting ambitious revenue targets for the year.

          <p>A 55-year-old man from Buckinghamshire, England, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a police officer in the leg with a crossbow. The incident occurred in May 2024 when officers responded to a neighbor dispute, during which the man also stabbed another individual. The judge described the man's actions as an attempt to 'hunt down the officer' and noted that he posed a significant risk. The injured officer, PC Curtis Foster, has since made a full recovery and returned to duty, but stated the attack has left him feeling more cautious at work.</p>

The article explains that Serbia is a viable host due to its stable diplomatic relations with Israel, its relative political neutrality in both the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine conflicts, and its possession of the necessary sporting infrastructure. This arrangement reflects a broader trend of finding neutral venues for teams from conflict zones, highlighting the complex intersection of sports and geopolitics.</p>

          <p>The recent congressional decision to rescind all federal funding for public broadcasting poses an existential threat to KSDP, a public radio station in Sand Point, Alaska. For this remote fishing community of 600, the station is a crucial source of local news, emergency alerts, and community connection. KSDP receives 70% of its budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), and its general manager warns the cuts will be 'seismic'. The loss of funding highlights the disproportionate impact on rural areas where public media often serves as the only local news source, filling a market gap left by commercial broadcasters.</p>

          <p>China's crude oil imports in July were bolstered by increased shipments from Russia, which became its top supplier for the month. According to customs data, China purchased 8.71 million tonnes of crude from Russia, a nearly 17% year-on-year increase. In contrast, purchases of U.S. crude oil remained suspended for the second consecutive month. This shift in energy trade highlights the strengthening economic ties between Beijing and Moscow amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. Overall, China's crude imports for the first seven months of the year saw a modest increase compared to the same period in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>
