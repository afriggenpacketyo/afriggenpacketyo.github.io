          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third major heatwave of 2025, with temperatures soaring to 34.7°C, prompting widespread water conservation measures. Over seven million people are now under hosepipe bans issued by water companies in Yorkshire and the South East due to record-level demand. Health authorities have issued amber heat alerts for much of England, warning of risks to the entire population, while Scotland and Northern Ireland face extreme wildfire warnings. Officials are urging the public to take precautions as scientists continue to link the increasing frequency of such extreme weather events to climate change.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a significant reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a broader Trump administration plan to reorganize the agency. This move is part of a larger staff reduction of nearly 3,000, which includes voluntary departures, and aims to streamline operations by consolidating departments and closing some domestic offices. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the cuts are indiscriminate and could undermine national security by weakening American diplomatic capabilities. The department maintains the changes are necessary to eliminate bureaucratic bloat and increase efficiency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into the catastrophic Air India crash in Ahmedabad suggests the cause was a sudden loss of engine thrust just after takeoff. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau indicates that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines moved from the "run" to "cutoff" position, leading to the crash that killed 241 of the 242 people aboard and 19 on the ground. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. The investigation is ongoing, and the report did not assign a reason for the switch transition.</p>

          <p>While touring the site of catastrophic flash floods in central Texas, President Trump praised the response efforts and dismissed questions about the adequacy of the area's warning systems. The disaster, which killed at least 121 people, has raised scrutiny over the local and federal handling of the crisis, but Trump characterized the response as heroic and competent. He criticized a reporter for asking about the timeliness of alerts, calling the question 'evil' under the circumstances. The visit highlights a contrast in Trump's approach to disasters in politically supportive regions compared to his past criticism of officials in other states.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As part of the plea agreement, he admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation for the Sinaloa cartel's "Los Chapitos" faction. In exchange for his plea and an agreement to forfeit $80 million, Guzman Lopez may receive a sentence less than life in prison, contingent upon his substantial cooperation with federal authorities. This cooperation could involve providing critical information about his family's cartel operations, potentially including testimony against his own brother.</p>

The rally was also supported by a wave of short liquidations and investor expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. Ether also experienced a significant surge, rising above the $3,000 mark for the first time since February. (not investment advice)</p>

UEFA has ruled that both clubs cannot compete, and because Lyon finished higher in its domestic league, it will retain its spot.

          <h2>Delta Air Lines Explores Further Segmentation of Premium Cabin Offerings</h2>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabins, such as business and first class, mirroring the strategy it applied to its main economy cabin. The airline, which pioneered fare types like basic economy, sees an opportunity to offer more varied products to high-end customers, whose demand has remained strong. Delta President Glen Hauenstein suggested the template of main cabin segmentation could be applied to premium offerings, potentially creating different tiers of service and amenities. While no specific changes have been announced, the move aims to capitalize on the growing revenue from premium seats, which rose 6% in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>A massive Antonov An-124 cargo aircraft was unexpectedly spotted flying over Kyiv before landing in Leipzig, Germany, sparking widespread surprise as Ukrainian airspace has been closed to most non-combat flights since 2022. The jet, operated by Antonov Airlines, had likely been stranded at the Svyatoshino airport in Kyiv since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Its successful departure is seen as a sign of Ukrainian resilience and a potential intelligence failure by Russia, which was unable to detect or intercept the large aircraft. Regenerating the An-124 for cargo operations would provide a significant revenue source for Ukraine's war effort.</p>

          <p>A divided federal appeals court has overturned plea agreements for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other men accused of planning the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The ruling voids a deal that would have allowed the defendants to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, a move former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had rescinded, stating he wanted the case to proceed toward a death-penalty trial. This decision prolongs the legal stalemate in the Guantánamo Bay military court, where the case has been stuck in pre-trial hearings for years.

His lawyers are requesting a 72-hour notice before any future removal to allow for legal challenges.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department reported an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion for June, a rare occurrence largely attributed to a significant surge in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than the previous year, following the implementation of broad new tariffs by the Trump administration. This monthly surplus helped narrow the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion, though it remains 5% higher than the same period last year. Despite the boost from tariffs, net interest payments on the national debt continue to be a major expense, totaling $84 billion for the month. (not investment advice)</p>
