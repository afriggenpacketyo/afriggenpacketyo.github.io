          <p>A growing number of international LGBTQ+ travelers are canceling or altering plans to visit the United States, citing concerns over anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and policies. Data from travel platforms shows a significant decline in U.S. bookings from Canadian and European users, who are instead choosing to spend their money in more inclusive destinations or their home countries. This trend reflects a form of "protest spending" and could impact the U.S. economy, as the LGBTQ+ travel market represents substantial purchasing power. Despite this, domestic attendance at Pride events in various U.S. cities, including those in conservative states, remains strong.</p>

          <p>At least 80 people have died in Texas following catastrophic flash floods, with officials in the hard-hit Texas Hill Country stating they were caught off guard by the disaster's speed and severity. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night, overwhelming communities while residents were asleep. Local authorities admitted they had no advance warning of the flood's unprecedented scale and lacked a river-based warning system. This lack of preparedness is a key focus as the region grapples with the immense loss of life, including many children at a summer camp.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet, celebrating their recent joint military strikes against Iran while facing the pressing issue of the ongoing war in Gaza. The meeting is expected to add urgency to a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, though a permanent end to the conflict remains a major hurdle, with Hamas and Israel at odds over the terms. Trump, aiming to bolster his image as a peacemaker, is reportedly pressuring for a resolution, which could be crucial for his broader vision of expanding the Abraham Accords to include nations like Saudi Arabia. The discussion will test the leaders' personal relationship and political leverage.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas have claimed dozens of lives, with many of the victims being children and staff from summer camps along the Guadalupe River. Among those lost were young girls like 8-year-old Renee Smajstrla and 9-year-old Janie Hunt, who were attending Camp Mystic, a nearly century-old Christian camp. The camp's longtime director, Richard "Dick" Eastland, also died, along with a camp counselor and the director of another nearby camp.

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, but the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will extend this protection. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners have praised the move as a significant step in recognizing early-stage pregnancy loss as a true bereavement and breaking the associated taboo.</p>

The strikes also targeted a power station and the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship hijacked by the Houthis in 2023, which Israel alleges was being used for surveillance. The Iran-backed Houthi group claimed its air defenses confronted the attack and responded by launching its own missiles toward Israel. This escalation follows months of Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea, which the group claims are in solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

          <p>The Turkish Defense Ministry has reported that twelve of its soldiers have died from methane gas poisoning in northern Iraq. The soldiers were exposed to the gas while conducting a search operation inside a cave for a comrade who was killed by Kurdish fighters three years ago. The cave, located in a region where Turkey has been conducting operations against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), was previously known to have been used as a hospital by militants.

          <p>The storm system Chantal, now downgraded to a tropical depression, has brought heavy rainfall and flash flooding to North Carolina, prompting dozens of water rescues before moving over Virginia. The storm made landfall in South Carolina as a tropical storm and is expected to continue its path northeast, producing 2 to 4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches in some areas. Flood watches have been issued for parts of the Mid-Atlantic states, including Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In North Carolina, the Haw River crested near record levels, causing a highway collapse and flooding over 100 roads in one county.</p>

Experts advise shopping around extensively for different lenders and loan programs, such as VA loans for qualifying individuals, which often have lower rates. Another strategy is seeking lenders that offer interest rate buydown programs, which can temporarily or permanently lower the rate in exchange for an upfront cost, helping to manage monthly payments.

          <p>A former NYPD commander argues that the practice of federal agents, particularly from ICE, wearing masks during enforcement actions is a grave mistake that undermines police legitimacy and public safety. While agents fear doxxing, masking creates a more significant danger by appearing predatory, preventing communication through facial cues, and making them indistinguishable from criminals. This could lead to citizens fighting back in fear or local police mistaking them for felons.

          <p>The long-standing American model of accommodating population growth through suburban sprawl is showing signs of failure, even in the historically affordable Sunbelt. Urban economists found that housing construction in metros like Phoenix and Atlanta has plummeted relative to their population, causing prices to surge and mirroring trends seen in expensive coastal cities decades ago. The slowdown is particularly pronounced in affluent, low-density suburbs that resist densification. This suggests the "suburban frontier" is closing, and without a fundamental rethinking of zoning laws to allow for more density and housing diversity, the nation's housing crisis will likely worsen.</p>

          <p>Edgar Veytia, a former top law enforcement official in Nayarit, Mexico, known as "El Diablo," is being sued in a U.S. federal court by five Mexican families under the Torture Victim Protection Act. The plaintiffs allege they endured torture, extortion, and death threats during Veytia's tenure as state attorney general, where he admittedly worked with drug cartels. Veytia was convicted of drug trafficking in the U.S. but was released early after testifying against another high-level narco-politician. The lawsuit seeks to hold him accountable for the atrocities he committed in Mexico, highlighting the deep-rooted impunity for corrupt officials within the Mexican justice system.</p>

          <p>A California bill aimed at making large fossil fuel companies pay for climate-related damages has stalled in the legislature for the second consecutive year due to intense lobbying from the oil and gas industry. The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act would require companies responsible for over a billion metric tons of emissions to contribute to a fund for climate mitigation and adaptation projects. Despite gaining momentum after recent wildfires, the legislation faced over $10 million in lobbying from opponents in the first quarter alone. Proponents argue the bill is necessary to shift the financial burden of climate disasters from taxpayers to the corporations responsible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A playful but intense rivalry has erupted on social media between UCLA and UC Berkeley, with both campuses claiming the title of the nation's number one public university. The dispute began after U.S. News & World Report's global rankings listed Berkeley as the top public institution, prompting Berkeley to boast online. UCLA quickly countered by citing a different U.S. News national ranking from nine months prior that placed it at number one, a title it has held for years. The back-and-forth highlights the different methodologies of various college ranking systems and has fueled a long-standing competition between the two prestigious University of California campuses.</p>

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia, a Democrat from California who came to the U.S. from Peru as a child and was formerly undocumented, is taking a leading role in pushing back against President Trump's agenda.

Garcia, who gained citizenship through the 1986 immigration reform act, embodies a story of the American dream and is now positioned to lead investigations into figures like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk if Democrats regain power.</p>

          <p>President Trump's enforcement of party loyalty is leading to a purge of dissenting voices within the Republican party, as seen with the retirement of Senator Thom Tillis. After Tillis opposed Trump's major budget bill due to its impact on his constituents, he faced a primary challenge threat and subsequently announced he would not seek reelection. This pattern of pushing out or converting critics has been ongoing, with figures like Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney being marginalized while others, like Marco Rubio, have aligned with Trump. This strategy purifies the party into a more compliant body, even at the risk of losing seats to Democrats.</p>

Foreign investors have been selling American stocks and bonds, contributing to the dollar's slide. While some economists see this as a natural market correction after years of a strong dollar, others warn it could signal a more permanent shift toward a multi-polar currency system.

          <p>An analysis of the cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) concludes that a $10,000 investment today is highly unlikely to grow to $1 million by 2035. For such a 100-fold increase, Cardano's market capitalization would need to reach approximately $2.1 trillion, rivaling that of Bitcoin today. The network currently lags significantly behind competitors like Solana in key metrics such as decentralized finance (DeFi) activity and stablecoin liquidity. Its slow, research-focused development approach, while rigorous, has left it behind on major industry trends, making the exponential growth required for such a return improbable without a major strategic pivot.
