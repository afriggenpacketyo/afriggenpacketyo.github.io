          <p>The UK Parliament engaged in a heated debate regarding proposed changes to the assisted dying bill, which aims to legalize the practice for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months in England and Wales. Key points of contention included the role of doctors, ensuring no obligation for assistance, and preventing medical staff from initiating the topic with patients. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, emphasized its strengthening, while Conservative MP Rebecca Paul voiced strong opposition, citing harm to vulnerable communities. The bill's progress and potential societal impact remain subjects of intense scrutiny. </p>

          <p>The anxiety surrounding hosting guests, often driven by the pressure to present a spotless home, can hinder social connection. Experts suggest focusing on making the space comfortable for guests rather than striving for magazine-worthy perfection. Therapists emphasize that personal standards are often shaped by cultural depictions and comparisons to others' highlight reels, leading to unnecessary self-judgment. The most important aspect of hosting is attentiveness to guests, ensuring they feel welcome and comfortable, rather than apologizing for minor imperfections. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody, bare footprints, led investigators on a decades-long quest to find the killer of 35-year-old Jeanie Childs, who was stabbed more than 60 times in 1993. Initially, suspicion fell on Arthur Gray, who lived with Childs, but his alibi and footprint analysis cleared him. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile, which eventually led to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Westrom was arrested in 2019 and, despite denying knowing Childs, footprint comparison confirmed his presence at the scene. </p>

          <p>Arab Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, welcomed President Trump with extravagant displays and pledges of significant economic exchange during his recent visit. These gestures aim to deepen ties with the U.S. and advance their own economic agendas. The deals, which include agreements for trillions of dollars in economic exchange and investments, signal a desire to partner with the U.S. in business, military, and technology. Some observers suggest a competition for Trump's affection among the Gulf countries, while others see it as a long-term strategic alignment. </p>

          <p>Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, stated that it is now "obvious" that then-President Joe Biden "was not in a condition to run for re-election". Khanna suggested that the Democratic Party should have admitted to making a "mistake" and held an open primary. His comments came after acknowledging past statements where he described Biden as "fully coherent" and admitting he did not "have the full picture". During an appearance on "The View" earlier this month, the former president pushed back against the notion that he suffered significant cognitive decline during his last year in office. </p>
