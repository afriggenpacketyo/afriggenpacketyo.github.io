          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group, has declared its intention to disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey after a 40-year insurgency. This decision follows a call from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the group to disarm and pursue Kurdish rights through political means. The PKK's announcement signifies a potential turning point in the decades-long conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and could reshape Turkish politics. The group stated that it had carried the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be solved by democratic politics, thus completing its historical mission.</p>

          <p>According to royal experts, Kate Middleton has achieved royal success by adhering to royal norms and not acting as a rebel, unlike Princess Diana. Edward White, author of "Dianaworld: An Obsession," emphasizes that Kate was more mature when she married Prince William at 29, learning from Diana's experiences to avoid rushing into royal life. Diana's youth and lack of preparation led to struggles within the monarchy, while Kate benefits from family support and a longer transition into her royal role. Kate's strategy involves fulfilling her duties without drawing excessive attention, contrasting with Diana's more public struggles and media interactions.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to significantly reduce tariffs imposed on each other over the past few months. In a joint statement, both sides said that ongoing discussions have the potential to address their economic and trade concerns. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower its import duties on American goods to 10% from 125% for a 90-day period.

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., announced it would lay down its arms and disband, a decision that could reshape Turkish politics and reverberate in neighboring countries. This announcement follows a call from its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who suggested that the group's armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose. The move could end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives and may influence other Kurdish militias, particularly in Syria. President Erdogan can claim to have done what his predecessors failed to do, and the P.K.K.’s dissolution could expand his support among Kurds, which many analysts suspect that he covets to change the Constitution and seek a third presidential term.</p>

Beckham responded by commenting, "Show a little respect, be elegant in triumph," and later, "Respect over everything," after Minnesota posted a banner reading "History over hype, culture over cash."

          <p>Donald Trump has pledged to use executive powers to cut prescription drug prices in the U.S. by 30% to 80%, aiming to align them more closely with other countries. This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks due to concerns about potential profit declines if prices are reduced. Trump intends to introduce a "most favored nation" policy, ensuring the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest drug prices globally. While the U.S. government already negotiates prices for some medicines under Medicare, Trump's proposed order could have a broader impact on the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

          <p>A decision on building 164 flats at a former factory site in Hunslet has been delayed by Leeds City Council due to the developer's inability to include affordable rentals.

          <p>Sugar, ubiquitous in modern diets, is linked to various health issues, including diabetes and obesity-related diseases. While it activates brain regions that induce pleasure, chronic sugar consumption can alter neuronal pathways, potentially leading to addiction-like behaviors. Emotional stress can trigger sugar cravings, and early life stress may prime the brain to seek out sugary foods. Health experts emphasize that long-term sugar overconsumption is dangerous, regardless of weight gain, and can lead to tooth decay, fatigue, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. Strategies to quit sugar addiction include behavioral interventions, nutritional changes, and government regulations such as sugar taxes.</p>

          <p>Search efforts for Eli Sweeting, a British hiker missing for over a week in New Zealand, have been "paused" by police. Sweeting was reported missing after failing to return from a solo hike up Mitre Peak. Despite a large-scale search involving local volunteers, helicopters, and search dogs, the difficult and dangerous terrain has led to the suspension of the search. Police will review their efforts to determine if further action can be taken, while maintaining contact with Sweeting's family during this distressing time.</p>

          <p>Despite a decline in domestic sake consumption, Japan's oldest sake brand, Kenbishi, remains dedicated to traditional brewing methods as a guarantee of quality. Brewing takes place during the winter, with brewers staying onsite for six months, using traditional wooden equipment like dakidaru. While stainless steel is the industry norm, Kenbishi believes only wood can maintain the necessary temperature for their sake. The brand sees UNESCO heritage listing of traditional sake-brewing techniques as an opportunity to revive interest in Japan and emphasizes its responsibility to protect its heritage and maintain the taste of Kenbishi sake.</p>

Lula views China as a partner in rebalancing global power and reducing dependency on the U.S. While trade between China and Latin America has grown significantly, concerns remain about the impact of Chinese exports on local manufacturers, leading some countries to implement protectionist measures.</p>

The government's upcoming Strategic Defence Review aims to address these issues, but doubts remain about its potential impact.

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation proposes new work and eligibility requirements, which Democrats warn will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office suggests the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. While Republicans claim they are rooting out "waste, fraud, and abuse," Democrats argue the cuts are a veiled attempt to repeal Obamacare.</p>

While Spanish authorities investigate the cause, including potential cyberattacks, some observers have pointed to the high reliance on wind and solar energy in Spain and Portugal as a possible factor. Spanish officials have denied that renewable energy was responsible for the outage, but the incident has intensified discussions about energy infrastructure and sustainability.</p>

The app caters to traditional money-saving practices like rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCA), also known as "money circles." Mohanty observed that mainstream banks often don't understand how immigrant communities manage their money, and much of the financial innovation for immigrants focuses on remittances rather than wealth-building. Bloom Money aims to provide a regulated and accessible platform for these traditional savings methods, which are often flagged as suspicious by mainstream banks.</p>

          <p>The recent China-US trade talks in Geneva are viewed as politically symbolic, providing both powers with interim relief at home without appearing weak on the trade war front. While the negotiators agreed to establish a “trade consultation mechanism,” analysts suggest that substantive deals addressing tariffs and other trade barriers are still a long way off. The U.S. is under political pressure to show wins, while China sees negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience. China aims to insulate its domestic economy from external shocks while selectively engaging in global markets.</p>
