          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June, Though Still Above Central Bank's Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, decreased to 3.3% in June, aligning with economists' expectations and marking a slight cooling from a 29-month high. Despite this easing, primarily due to lower rice prices, the headline inflation rate remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 39th consecutive month. Economists note that inflationary pressures persist, and risks from a depreciating yen and potential US tariffs could complicate the economic outlook. The political landscape adds further uncertainty, with an upcoming election potentially weakening the ruling coalition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters admitted on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting about a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged Watters' show lied about the timeline of the call to suggest a discussion about deploying troops. While Watters used the words "I'm sorry," his statement was described as snarky and not a full apology, asserting that Newsom's social media post was "confusing and unclear." Newsom has indicated he will proceed with the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Diane Abbott, the UK's longest-serving female MP, has been suspended from the Labour Party for a second time after stating she did not regret comments she made in 2023 about racism. In a recent BBC interview, Abbott reiterated her view that racism based on skin color is different from other forms of prejudice, which had led to her initial year-long suspension. Following the new interview, Abbott was suspended pending another investigation, stating that she believes the Labour leadership "wants me out" despite her comments being "factually correct."</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a vote on a Trump-backed bill to rescind approximately $9 billion in government spending, targeting foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The legislation faced procedural hurdles in the House Rules Committee, where Democrats attempted to attach an amendment forcing the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The Senate has already passed a slightly smaller version of the cuts, which now heads to the House for a final vote against a tight deadline. The package cuts funding for programs like USAID and support for public stations like NPR and PBS. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Europe was a "free-rider" in the past regarding its own defense and security funding but is now increasing its contributions. In an interview with the BBC, Merz affirmed that Germany is boosting its defense spending in response to the threat from Russia and is coordinating closely with the US and other European allies. The comments were made as Germany and the UK work to strengthen a friendship treaty focused on defense, migration, and economic growth. Merz also addressed trade tensions, expressing hope for a resolution to avoid threatened US tariffs on EU exports.</p>

Trump has vehemently denied the story, labeling it a "fake" and threatening to sue the newspaper and its parent company, News Corp.

          <p>This week's film releases offer a variety of genres, including the new horror sequel "I Know What You Did Last Summer," which is described as ironically self-aware but ultimately not memorable. Also reviewed is Ari Aster's "Eddington," a neo-western set during the 2020 pandemic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which tackles political division in a realistic yet strange manner. Other notable films include "Afternoons of Solitude," a powerful and difficult documentary about bullfighting, and two LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," each exploring unique and sensitive romantic stories.</p>

          <p>Intensified immigration raids across Southern California since June have profoundly altered the region's way of life, creating a climate of fear among its large undocumented population. Many residents are now afraid to go to work, school, or even shop for groceries, leading to deserted public spaces and canceled community events. The article highlights the story of a farmworker who died during a raid, and the violent clashes that can ensue. While the Trump administration touts the arrest of serious criminals, activists and residents describe a program of terror that targets many with no criminal history.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old and drilled from deep within Antarctica, has arrived in the UK for scientific analysis. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey will melt the ancient ice to study trapped materials like dust, ash, and air bubbles. This research aims to unlock new information about Earth's climate history, particularly a mysterious period when the planet's glacial cycles changed. The findings could provide crucial insights into how the planet responds to high levels of greenhouse gases, helping to refine future climate change models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New UK regulations coming into force next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, aimed at protecting consumers from accumulating excessive debt, means some users may be refused credit. Regulators and debt charities support the new rules, which will bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit. The changes will also grant consumers the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and provide clearer information on fees and cancellation rights. (not investment advice)</p>

Lucy Bronze ultimately scored the decisive penalty to secure the 3-2 win.

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) in an April filing with the U.S. Small Business Administration.

The filing occurred shortly before a financing round valued Neuralink at $9 billion and while Musk, the world's wealthiest person, was leading a government efficiency initiative for the Trump administration.

The 62-count indictment alleges the defendants created and authenticated false police reports depicting immigrants as victims of fabricated crimes. These bogus reports were then used to help the immigrants apply for U-visas, a special status for crime victims who assist law enforcement, in exchange for thousands of dollars per application. The defendants face charges including conspiracy, mail fraud, and bribery, which could result in decades in prison if convicted.</p>

The men, originally from countries like Vietnam and Cuba, were deported because the U.S. said their home countries would not accept them back. This action is part of the Trump administration's controversial policy of sending deportees to nations with which they have no ties, raising alarm from human rights groups.

          <p>The Labour Party's decision to re-suspend MP Diane Abbott is analyzed as a near-inevitable consequence of the party's recent history and its leader's commitment to fighting antisemitism. The article argues that because Abbott expressed no regret for the 2023 comments that led to her first suspension, the party had to act consistently to maintain its credibility on the issue. Sir Keir Starmer has made an unflinching stance against antisemitism a central pillar of his leadership after the party was found to have breached the Equality Act under his predecessor. This political context is crucial to understanding the party's swift action.</p>

          <p>The price of beef in the United States has reached record levels, with ground beef and steak prices seeing significant year-over-year increases. This surge is attributed to a long-term trend of a shrinking national cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. The situation is further exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
