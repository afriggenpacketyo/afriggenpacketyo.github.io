            <p>Consumer sentiment experienced a sharp decline in April, driven by escalating inflation expectations that reached levels unseen since 1981, according to a University of Michigan survey. The survey revealed widespread concerns across various demographics regarding business conditions, personal finances, incomes, and the labor market, signaling potential recession risks. Inflation expectations for the coming year surged to 6.7%, while the five-year outlook rose to 4.4%, prompting negative market reactions and increased Treasury yields. These findings highlight growing economic anxieties among consumers amidst ongoing tariff concerns.</p>

            <p>The UK Parliament has been recalled to debate emergency legislation aimed at preventing the imminent closure of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. The government seeks immediate powers to control the site, ensuring sufficient raw materials to maintain production, as current supplies are dwindling. This move stops short of full nationalization but keeps all options open to secure the plant's future and protect jobs. The potential shutdown threatens the UK's capacity to produce higher-grade virgin steel, deemed vital by industry experts.</p>

            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed concerns that the U.S. economy is nearing or already in a recession, citing weakening consumer and business sentiment. He attributes this slowdown to uncertainty stemming from recent tariff announcements, despite a temporary pause on some levies. Fink noted that consumers might have been stockpiling goods, potentially masking underlying economic weakness, but maintains that long-term economic trends like AI will persist. While not seeing a financial crisis, Fink's remarks underscore anxieties about the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's proposed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could have significant repercussions for drugmakers and patients in the U.S., potentially disrupting the supply chain and increasing drug prices. Experts warn that these tariffs could exacerbate existing drug shortages, particularly for generic sterile injectables, which are already vulnerable due to complex manufacturing and low profit margins. While some drugmakers with substantial domestic manufacturing may be better positioned to absorb the costs, the tariffs could undermine efforts to control healthcare costs and make medications less affordable for Americans.</p>

            <p>Amidst President Trump's push for domestic manufacturing, analysts speculate on the feasibility and cost of producing an iPhone in the United States. Estimates range from a 25% increase in price due to labor costs, potentially reaching $1,500, to a more drastic $3,500 per device. Challenges include the lack of a large-scale skilled workforce and the need to import components, potentially incurring additional tariffs. Despite the political appeal, industry experts remain skeptical, citing Apple's reliance on China's established manufacturing ecosystem and the high costs associated with reshoring production.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Hollywood's presence in the Chinese box office was already waning before the recent tariff escalations, as Chinese audiences increasingly favor domestic films. The expiration of the U.S.-China Film Agreement in 2017 further limited the number of American films guaranteed release in China. While decreased releases of Hollywood films will have a slight impact on overall global box office, the real economic issue for Hollywood is the currency weakening. The rise of sophisticated local film production and technology has also contributed to the shift, making it harder for American studios to rely on the Chinese market for bolstering profits.</p>

            <p>Many U.S. law firms are quietly removing references to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from their websites and revising descriptions of pro-bono work to align with the Trump administration's priorities. This includes eliminating mentions of pro-bono immigration work and altering language to remove the word "diversity". These changes come as Trump has waged an attack on DEI programs and the legal profession, seeking to punish firms and lawyers who challenge him in court. Some firms have agreed not to use DEI in hiring to avoid executive orders.</p>
