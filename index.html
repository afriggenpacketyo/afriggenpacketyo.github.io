          <h2>Arkansas Officials Urge Trump to Reconsider Disaster Relief Denial</h2>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are appealing to President Trump after FEMA denied Arkansas' request for federal disaster relief following severe storms in March, which caused widespread damage and fatalities. They emphasize the vital need for federal assistance to rebuild affected communities. This marks the first instance of Republicans publicly challenging a FEMA denial under the Trump administration. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between states and the federal government regarding disaster relief, as similar requests from Washington and North Carolina have also been denied, though those were states run by Democratic governors.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is exploring a potential boycott of El Salvador in response to the country's assistance to the Trump administration in the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a suspected MS-13 gang member. Pritzker cites concerns over due process and constitutional rights, directing state entities to review investments and contracts with ties to El Salvador. The move follows unsuccessful attempts by several Democrats to meet with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador. The Trump administration maintains its stance against aiding Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate it, citing domestic violence allegations and suspected human trafficking.</p>

          <p>A bill in California, proposed by Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, is facing intense opposition for aiming to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels, with protesters rallying against the measure. Calderon, formerly an executive at Southern California Edison, argues the bill addresses inequities in electricity costs, stating that non-solar customers are burdened by higher bills due to the credits received by solar panel owners. Environmental groups and the solar industry argue against the bill, citing previous state assurances of 20-year incentive periods and highlighting utility infrastructure spending as a primary driver of rising rates. The bill underscores the ongoing conflict between utilities, solar companies, and consumers regarding the future of renewable energy incentives.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, has issued a warning that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patient safety.

Factors contributing to staff fatigue include shift work, long hours, and financial pressures. The watchdog urges the government and NHS England to implement better systems for monitoring fatigue and raising awareness of the issue.</p>

          <p>Water UK, the industry body, has admitted that self-monitoring of sewage pollution levels by water companies is damaging public trust and proposes a third-party monitoring system. This recommendation is part of a submission to the UK government's independent review of the water sector. The industry body stated that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to "reduce the administrative burden" on the Environment Agency (EA). A National Audit Office report is expected to highlight the Environment Agency's limited capacity for new monitoring, raising concerns about oversight and enforcement.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has indicated he will reduce his involvement with the federal government, while continuing to advocate for lower tariffs. Musk's influence in Washington had been significant, driving changes across government and eliciting varied reactions from officials. He acknowledged that whether President Trump will heed his advice is uncertain. This shift suggests a recalibration of Musk's role in shaping government policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it is hindering peace negotiations. Trump stated that a deal to end the war was "very close" but Zelenskyy's refusal to accept US terms "will do nothing but prolong" the conflict. This stance contrasts with Ukraine's long-held position that it will not cede Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The comments come amid ongoing discussions between international officials aimed at securing a ceasefire in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade threats are uniting Canadians, even those who support Quebec independence, as they rally around the federal government to confront the challenges posed by the US. Many Quebec sovereigntists are prioritizing Canadian patriotism over independence in the face of perceived threats from the US. The shift in sentiment is influencing voter behavior, with some Quebecers who typically support independence parties now considering voting for federalist parties.
