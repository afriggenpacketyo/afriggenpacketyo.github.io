        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a stunning upset, Reform UK candidate Sarah Pochin secured a parliamentary seat in Runcorn and Helsby by a mere six votes, marking a significant win against the Labour Party. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP following an assault conviction, creating an opportunity for Reform to capitalize on voter frustration. Nigel Farage celebrated the victory, suggesting Reform has supplanted the Conservative Party as the main opposition. Labour officials acknowledged the difficult circumstances of the by-election, attributing the loss to controversial government decisions impacting pensioners and those receiving disability benefits.</p>

          <p>China appears to be easing its ban on K-pop acts, signaling a potential shift in economic strategy amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The move comes as China seeks to stimulate domestic demand, with K-pop seen as a tariff-proof sector that can boost tourism, hospitality, and local commerce. Analysts also suggest that the shift has a diplomatic dimension, potentially aimed at restoring ties with neighboring countries like South Korea. The return of K-pop could be a catalyst for K-pop stocks, as China represents a significant market for the industry. </p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese-owned shopping platform, is shifting its US business model to a local fulfillment strategy in response to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. The platform is actively recruiting US-based sellers to handle sales to American customers, with orders fulfilled from within the country. This move comes amid speculation that Temu may phase out China-based merchants, requiring them to establish operations in the US or cease selling to American shoppers. The company claims this operational change will not affect pricing for US consumers.</p>

          <p>Oil giant Shell reported better-than-expected first-quarter profits, leading to the announcement of another $3.5 billion share buyback program. Despite earnings falling compared to the previous year, the company's strong performance and resilient balance sheet provide confidence for continued shareholder returns. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks. Shell reaffirmed its reduced annual investment budget of $20 billion to $22 billion for 2025, focusing on increasing shareholder returns and cutting spending, while doubling down on its liquified natural gas (LNG) push.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals from the Southern District of Texas. The judge, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., ruled that the White House's use of the 18th-century wartime law was illegal, stating that it was improperly stretched to apply to modern-day immigration policy. The ruling, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases challenging the administration's use of the Act. The judge rejected the claim that the activities of a Venezuelan street gang constituted an "invasion" as defined by the Act.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota, Honda, and other Japanese carmakers saw a significant increase in U.S. sales in April, driven by customers rushing to purchase vehicles before an additional tariff on imported cars took effect. The additional tariff of 25% on cars produced outside the United States, implemented by President Donald Trump, prompted customers to buy hybrid and sport-utility vehicles. While the sales boost is positive in the short term, the auto market outlook remains uncertain as the last-minute buying may reduce future demand. The companies also source vehicles for the U.S. market from other countries.</p>

          <p>"Jeopardy!" host Ken Jennings, who once competed against IBM's Watson, expresses skepticism about current artificial intelligence (AI), stating that modern LLMs would outperform Watson. While acknowledging AI's advancements, Jennings emphasizes the importance of human creativity and the sense of connection with a human mind in creative fields. He contrasts this with what he calls "AI slop," lacking the personal touch he values in art. Jennings' comments reflect concerns about AI's potential impact on creative professions, a fear that gained prominence during recent writers' and actors' strikes.</p>

Reform UK made gains in council seats, while the Conservatives are expecting heavy losses across the country. Results for remaining mayoral contests and council elections are anticipated, with the Liberal Democrats targeting councils in the south and Reform UK gaining ground in other regions.</p>

The appointment to multiple roles is seen as a sign of trust from Trump and a close relationship with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.
