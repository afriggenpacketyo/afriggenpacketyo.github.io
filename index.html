          <p>China is experiencing a significant housing downturn, with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and JD.com hosting large online distressed property sales. Judicial auction prices are at their lowest in years, often 77% of appraised value, suppressing home prices and buyer sentiment. The number of foreclosures is rapidly increasing, with economists estimating over 1 million properties added to auction lists this year, drawing comparisons to the 2000s US subprime mortgage crisis. This crisis burdens financial institutions and poses a risk to global financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a large house party in Maxton, North Carolina, resulted in two fatalities and seven critical injuries, with a total of 13 people shot. Deputies initially responded to a loud music complaint before receiving calls about the shooting. The deceased were identified as Jessie Locklear Jr., 49, and Nehemiah Locklear, 16. Robeson County Sheriff Burnis Wilkins condemned the "senseless act of gun violence," highlighting the involvement of teenagers, alcohol, and guns.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new 10% tariff on Canadian imports, citing a "fraudulent" TV advertisement aired by Ontario that featured former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Trump claimed Canada misrepresented facts and acted hostilely by allowing the ad to run during the World Series despite an agreement to pull it. This escalation follows Trump's earlier withdrawal from trade talks with Canada, which already faces significant tariffs on various goods. The move further strains trade relations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris, in a BBC interview, stated "I am not done," leaving open the possibility of another presidential run. She reflected on her 2024 election loss to Donald Trump and reiterated her warnings about his authoritarian tendencies. Despite a recent book release, polls in her home state of California show less than a third of voters support her running for president in 2028, with Governor Gavin Newsom receiving more backing. Harris expressed confidence that a woman would become president in her grandnieces' lifetime.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy was hospitalized after ingesting between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets, resulting in the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, purchased online, clamped together inside his body, causing pressure necrosis. Surgeons successfully removed the magnet chains during an exploratory operation, and the boy recovered after eight days. New Zealand has banned the sale of such magnets, but online availability makes enforcement difficult. The incident highlights the severe dangers of ingesting these magnets, which are significantly stronger than traditional ones.</p>

          <p>Passive investing via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) may be losing its appeal, despite record stock market highs. Financial experts note investors are seeking diversification beyond market indexes, as technology now comprises over 35% of the S&P 500, leading to an imbalance. Defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight. This shift is driving renewed interest in small-cap stocks, such as the Russell 2000, which has recently outperformed the S&P 500. Next week, "Magnificent 7" tech giants are set to report earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur addresses regional economic integration, security, and digital developments, with US President Donald Trump attending. A key underlying theme is the growing geopolitical rivalry between the US and China, particularly concerning Taiwan and the South China Sea. ASEAN countries face pressure to choose sides, but many are wary of Trump's tariff policies and China's assertive territorial claims. Economically weaker states align with China, while larger nations like the Philippines and Indonesia strive for a delicate balancing act, maintaining ties with both superpowers.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which aims to redraw congressional district lines, is gaining traction by framing itself as a response to Donald Trump and Republican gerrymandering efforts. Governor Gavin Newsom and Democrats are campaigning on a "fight fire with fire" message, seeking to create five additional safe Democratic seats to counterbalance Republican gains elsewhere. Despite mixed feelings about abandoning non-partisan maps, recent polls show strong support for Proposition 50, particularly among voters motivated by opposition to Trump, suggesting an easy victory.</p>

          <p>A four-year study in Southern California found that nearly one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs) were linked to E. coli strains from contaminated meat, primarily turkey and chicken. This finding highlights contaminated meat as a significant public health issue beyond food safety nuisances. The research, using genomic attribution, also revealed higher contamination rates in lower-income ZIP codes and large "value packs," suggesting socioeconomic disparities in exposure. Experts emphasize improved food safety regulations and consumer vigilance in handling raw meat.</p>
