          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated that the Senate will soon move forward on a long-stalled, bipartisan bill to impose new economic sanctions on Russia. The legislation, which includes a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian energy, aims to increase pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. Despite previous delays due to other foreign policy issues and White House concerns, Thune stated that "the time has come" for a vote, which is expected within the next 30 days. The bill has overwhelming support in both the Senate and the House, virtually guaranteeing its passage once brought to the floor.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of military power, three U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers flew near the coast of Venezuela after taking off from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The flight of the long-range, heavy bombers, which are capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons, is being interpreted as a deliberate show of force by the Trump administration. This action occurs amidst heightened tensions and a major buildup of U.S. forces in the region. The article notes this is a developing story with more details expected to emerge.</p>

          <p>Shares of regional banks, including Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance, experienced a sharp decline following disclosures of significant bad loans and alleged borrower fraud. These incidents have intensified Wall Street fears about lax lending practices, particularly within the opaque private credit market, which were initially sparked by recent bankruptcies in the auto-parts sector. The sell-off has prompted concerns of a wider credit issue, with investors now warily searching for other potential problems lurking on bank balance sheets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna is proposing a House resolution to implement stricter standards for federal immigration agencies, citing recent "lawless" enforcement tactics. The resolution calls for mandatory body cameras, visible identification for agents, and the transfer of ICE oversight to the Department of Justice. This move follows controversial federal immigration crackdowns, such as Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, which involved the use of tear gas and unmarked vehicles. While unlikely to pass in the GOP-controlled House, the proposal aims to enhance transparency and accountability for both ICE and CBP personnel.</p>

          <p>Goaltender Carter Hart has signed a contract with the Vegas Golden Knights, making him the first of five former 2018 Canadian world junior hockey players to return to the NHL after being acquitted of sexual assault charges. The players, who were charged in 2024 in connection with a 2018 incident, are eligible to resume play on December 1st as part of a league reinstatement process. The judge in the trial ruled that the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proof. The NHL, while acknowledging the acquittal, stated the players' conduct did not meet the league's standard of moral integrity.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve implementing interest rate cuts, many American consumers are not seeing a corresponding drop in their credit card APRs. While the Fed's benchmark rate typically influences variable rates on consumer debt, the average credit card rate has fallen only marginally. Experts suggest that credit card issuers are mitigating their risk by not fully passing on the rate decreases, and some retail card rates have even risen. This leaves consumers with high-cost debt, as even a full rate cut would provide minimal relief on revolving balances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While debt settlement can offer a path to resolve high-interest unsecured debts like credit cards, several types of obligations are typically excluded from these programs. Secured debts, such as mortgages and auto loans, do not qualify because lenders can instead repossess the collateral. Similarly, government-backed debts like federal student loans and tax liabilities have their own specific resolution processes and are not eligible for traditional settlement. Other non-negotiable debts include court-ordered payments like child support, alimony, and legal fines, making it crucial for consumers to understand these limitations before pursuing settlement.</p>

This transfer of wealth stems from the direct cost of tariffs, as well as indirect expenses from logistics delays and supply chain disruptions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing economic concerns, a new survey from PwC indicates that American consumers are still planning to spend significantly on Halloween this year. Nearly 80% of respondents intend to participate in the holiday, with the average celebrant expected to spend $289, and parents with young children spending around $445. The largest spending categories are costumes and decorations, followed closely by party supplies and candy for trick-or-treaters. This trend suggests that consumers view Halloween as a relatively small, experience-focused expense that they are unwilling to cut back on, signaling resilience in holiday-related spending.</p>

          <p>A Republican effort to fund the Department of Defense for the full year, intended as an alternative path during the government shutdown, failed to advance in the Senate. The procedural vote was 50-44, falling short of the 60 votes needed, as most Democrats opposed the measure. Democratic leaders argued against funding the military separately from other domestic priorities like healthcare and housing, adhering to their strategy of negotiating a broader government funding package. The failed vote underscores the persistent stalemate in Congress, ensuring that the government shutdown continues and military members face ongoing uncertainty about their pay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal budget deficit saw a modest reduction in fiscal year 2025, falling by $41 billion to $1.78 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. A significant factor in this decrease was a record-setting $202 billion collected from customs duties, a 142% surge largely due to President Trump's tariffs. However, this increased revenue was offset by record-high interest payments on the national debt, which totaled over $1.2 trillion for the year. The deficit-to-GDP ratio is estimated at 5.9%, remaining well above historical norms for non-recessionary periods. (not investment advice)</p>

Specifically, the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies, and western Great Lakes are predicted to see above-normal precipitation.

          <p>The potential U.S. supply of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine is a major point of contention, with Kyiv believing they could pressure Moscow toward peace and Russia viewing it as a "qualitatively different escalation." These long-range, high-accuracy missiles can fly at very low altitudes, making them difficult for Russian air defense systems to intercept, as demonstrated in past U.S. strikes in Syria. If supplied, Tomahawks could allow Ukraine to strike key military and industrial targets deep inside Russia, up to 1,600 kilometers away. However, their high cost and limited production rate mean Ukraine would likely receive a small number.</p>
