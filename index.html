He discusses the unique fan culture, Verstappen's iconic status, and the evolution of F1's entertainment aspect under Liberty Media. Jansen also notes a potential decline in "Orange Army" attendance due to rising ticket prices and repetitive grandstand locations, as Zandvoort prepares for its final F1 race in 2026.</p>

          <p>Cambricon, a Shanghai-listed chip company, has cautioned investors about potential risks despite a staggering 533% stock gain over the past year. The company's stock surge is attributed to China's supportive AI chip policies and new AI models. However, Cambricon highlighted that its stock price might be detached from its fundamentals and warned of supply chain vulnerabilities due to ongoing US export restrictions.

          <p>Naomi Osaka strongly condemned Jelena Ostapenko's comments to Taylor Townsend, calling them "one of the worst things you could say to a black tennis player." Ostapenko reportedly told Townsend she had "no class" and "no education" after their US Open match. While Townsend, an African-American player, stated she didn't perceive a racial undertone, Osaka emphasized the historical stigma and the inappropriateness of the remarks in a predominantly white sport. Ostapenko denied any racist intent via Instagram.</p>

Rooney explained that Sir Alex Ferguson initially wanted to wait a year, but United had to act quickly to prevent him from joining Newcastle. He also mentioned a near-move to Chelsea, which would have involved a loan to Middlesbrough, a condition he rejected.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit signals a potential thaw in the uneasy relationship between the two Asian giants, strained since the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes. Despite deep-seated suspicion in India, economic pressures like US tariffs and shifting supply chains are pushing Beijing and New Delhi towards reluctant cooperation. India seeks to address its widening trade deficit with China and reduce reliance on Chinese components, while China eyes access to the Indian market for its overproducing industries.</p>

          <p>A government contractor has been instructed to remove job advertisements for floristry and hairdressing tutors, including one for "ballooncraft," at an immigration removal center near Heathrow airport. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra ordered Mitie, the facilities management company, to scrap roles with annual salaries up to £39,000, deeming them unnecessary. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the spending as "perks" that divert resources from deportations, while Mitie argued such services help detainees manage stress.</p>

          <p>Luo Weiwei, a former NASA scientist, has emerged as a pivotal figure in China's semiconductor industry, particularly with her company Innoscience specializing in gallium nitride (GaN) technology. Founded in 2015, Innoscience became the world's first to mass-produce 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers within six years, positioning China at the forefront of third-generation semiconductor technology. This achievement is significant amidst US efforts to decouple from China on cutting-edge chip technology, as Innoscience is now listed as a supplier for Nvidia's advanced AI data centers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted on charges related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. Judge Sheryl Lipman cited concerns of bias after the original presiding judge allegedly suggested one defendant was a gang member following a separate incident. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights. This development prolongs the legal process in a case that sparked nationwide protests over police brutality.</p>

          <p>Sean Charles Dunn, a former Department of Justice employee, has been charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly throwing a "Subway" sandwich at a federal Customs and Border Protection officer. Prosecutors opted for a misdemeanor charge after a grand jury declined to indict him on a felony assault. The incident occurred during a deployment of federal officers to Washington D.C., where Dunn allegedly shouted expletives at them. Dunn was fired by the DOJ following his arrest, and this marks the second recent instance of prosecutors failing to secure a felony indictment in similar cases.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, continues to struggle with rebuilding efforts, battling FEMA over promised funding. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich reports FEMA still owes the city $34 million for sewage and stormwater system upgrades, a project now costing $111 million due to rising costs. Despite two denied appeals and previous disputes over fund usage, Biloxi remains in limbo, emblematic of 254 other unfinished Katrina relief projects. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's proposed FEMA overhaul and staff reductions.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have begun activating the "snapback mechanism" to restore major UN sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. This move escalates tensions over Tehran's nuclear program, which the E3 nations deem a "clear and deliberate" non-compliance with the accord, citing Iran's high enriched uranium stockpile. Iran's foreign minister rejected the legal jurisdiction of this action, while the US welcomed the initiative, emphasizing readiness for direct engagement towards a peaceful resolution.</p>
