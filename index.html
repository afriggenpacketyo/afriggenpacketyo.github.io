          <p>Following two days of high-level discussions in London, the United States and China have agreed on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement addresses Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports and potential rollbacks of U.S. tech sales restrictions. The deal requires approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping, indicating that unresolved details still need internal discussion. This framework reflects a mutual commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, though the extent of concrete agreements remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked President Trump's tariffs, allowing them to remain in place until at least the end of July. The appellate judges have scheduled oral arguments for July 31, meaning the tariffs will stay in effect unless further court action occurs. The tariffs, imposed on imports from various countries including Canada, China, and Mexico, have been justified by Trump using a 1977 law that allows the president to regulate imports during emergency situations. The trade war has faced criticism from both parties, but Trump maintains the tariffs are necessary to fix trade imbalances.</p>

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a judge's ruling against it, and was later returned to face human smuggling charges. Newman accuses the Trump administration of defying court orders and disparaging Abrego Garcia, who they allege is associated with MS-13, which his family denies.

The panel argues that preventing Chagossians from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to return to their ancestral lands.

          <p>Residents in Japan with foreign roots are increasingly voicing concerns about racial profiling by police, with some taking legal action. A survey revealed that over 71% of foreign nationals in Japan have been questioned by police in the past five years, a rate significantly higher than for Japanese citizens. The National Police Agency issued an advisory in December 2021 to avoid questioning based solely on appearance, and some officers are now using body cameras to record interrogations. Despite these efforts, some view recent government statements as potentially encouraging discriminatory attitudes.</p>
