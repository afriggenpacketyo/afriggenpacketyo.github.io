        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Russia's response is being closely monitored, especially given Iran's support for Russia in the Ukraine war through the provision of military drones. However, analysts suggest that Russia may offer little beyond verbal support, as it needs its own resources for its ongoing aggression in Ukraine. Russia also needs to balance its relationship with Iran against its desire to improve ties with the U.S. under a potentially more Russia-friendly Trump administration, making any significant assistance to Iran unlikely. Moscow has called for negotiations between Iran and Israel to peacefully resolve the escalating crisis, indicating a cautious approach. The situation underscores the delicate geopolitical balance Russia must maintain. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that could significantly impact global energy markets. Experts suggest that closing the strait carries substantial risks for Iran, including alienating neighboring oil-producing countries and provoking hostilities. Data indicates that Iran ships a significant amount of oil through the strait, and a closure would also affect its trade relations with Asia, particularly China. While there are currently no indications of threats to commercial shipping, potential disruptions could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions, although the possibility of closure remains minimalistic. </p>

          <p>A shooting at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulted in one person injured and the death of the suspect. The suspect, Brian Anthony Browning, arrived at the church armed with a rifle and handgun, firing at the building from the outside. A parishioner struck the suspect with a vehicle, and at least two staff members, including a security guard, shot at him, resulting in his death. The injured staff member was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief has voiced his shock and frustration regarding a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, an activist group. This comes after Palestine Action activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and vandalized military planes, protesting the UK's support of Israel. While acknowledging the right to protest, the police chief described Palestine Action as an "organised extremist criminal group," noting that the Met lacks legal authority to prevent the protest until the group is proscribed. The protest's location has been moved from Parliament to Trafalgar Square due to new restrictions imposed by the police. </p>

Secretary of State Rubio stated the U.S. is prepared to meet with Iran to discuss the issue diplomatically, reiterating that the strikes aimed to eliminate the threat of a nuclear weapon.

Ceramic objects decorated with geometric figures and figures of fishermen were also found near the mummy, which belongs to the pre-Inca Chancay culture.

Practical wisdom, or phronesis, is about making good judgments in complex situations, a skill that is increasingly relevant in the age of AI.

          <p>The Strait of Hormuz is a critical global oil transit chokepoint, with approximately 20% of the world's oil and gas flowing through it. Bounded by Iran, Oman, and the UAE, the strait connects the Persian Gulf with the Arabian Sea. Closing the strait would have profound consequences for the global economy, disrupting international trade and raising oil prices. While Iran has threatened to close the strait in the past, it has never followed through, but the current tensions increase the risk of such action. The U.S. has called on China to intervene, as any disruption would heavily impact Asian economies that rely on the strait for oil imports. </p>

          <p>The author discusses how Yahya Sinwar, former leader of Hamas in Gaza, overestimated his capabilities and those of the Iranian-led "Axis of Resistance." Sinwar's miscalculations led to the October 7 massacre, which resulted in the dismantling of Hamas and the weakening of Hezbollah. The author also explores how Iran's leaders misunderstood Trump's foreign policy impulses, leading to the American attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The piece highlights the strategic failures of Israel's adversaries, who underestimated the desire of Israelis to live in their ancestral homeland. </p>

Despite these disagreements, the actual Trump voter base remains primarily focused on Trump himself, and he resists ideological constraints.

          <p>A new study finds that climate change is increasing the risk of sleep apnea, with the chance of having sleep apnea problems increasing by almost 50% when temperatures are 80 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer. The study used sleep data from over 125,000 people in 41 countries, finding that the risk of severe sleep apnea nearly doubled in many northern countries. Climate change has already increased global temperatures, leading to worsened sleep and higher health costs. Controlling the sleep environment with fans or air conditioning can help, but access to cooling is limited for many. </p>
