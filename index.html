            <p>Senior scientist Yi Shouliang has left his position at the US Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory and the University of Pittsburgh to return to China, where he will take on a new role at Sichuan University.

During his time at NETL, Yi focused on developing novel membranes and adsorption materials for carbon capture and water management initiatives. The circumstances surrounding his departure remain undisclosed, and his name is not currently listed as a chief researcher on the DOE and NETL's official websites, despite his extensive tenure there.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors and defense attorneys have delivered closing arguments in the bribery trial of Nadine Menendez, wife of former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was previously sentenced to 11 years in prison on related charges. Prosecutors allege Nadine acted as a broker, selling her husband's political power for personal gain, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car. The defense argued that the government's definitions of "official acts" and "quid pro quo" were too broad, claiming the alleged actions were routine political behavior. The jury will now deliberate after receiving instructions from the judge.</p>

            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China has missed several key targets in its "Made in China 2025" plan, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in technology. While the country has surpassed targets in the automotive sector, it has fallen short in aerospace, high-end robots, and manufacturing value-added growth. Despite this, China has made significant progress in technological dominance in shipbuilding, high-speed rail, and electric cars. The report also highlights concerns about overcapacity and increased global worries about security risks due to China's manufacturing advancements.</p>

            <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vowed to veto all bills amid a standoff with the Republican-controlled Legislature over funding for the state's Division of Developmental Disabilities. Hobbs demands a bipartisan compromise to guarantee funding for the agency, which supports nearly 60,000 people with disabilities. Republicans want to establish guardrails for the program before approving funding, while Democrats want to approve funding first and discuss reforms later. Hobbs claims Republicans are using the crisis for political leverage, and is willing to veto legislation she supports to reach a bipartisan agreement.</p>

            <p>Ancient silk paintings from China's Ming dynasty provide new clues about the domestication of brown rats, suggesting they may have spread globally via the treasure ship fleets of explorer Zheng He. The artwork, dating to 1425-1435 AD, depicts domesticated brown rats with coat color variation, predating previous evidence of domestication by over two centuries. Researchers propose that domesticated brown rats may have stowed away on Zheng He's ships, which involved tens of thousands of men and hundreds of vessels. Brown rats, common worldwide, are believed to have originated in northern China and Mongolia.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose port fees on Chinese ships in an effort to revive shipbuilding in the US and challenge China's dominance in the industry. The fees will be based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle number, starting in 180 days and increasing over the next three years. These fees are less severe than initially proposed, but still raise concerns about disrupting global trade. The move comes amid existing trade tensions and warnings that it could raise prices for US consumers.</p>

            <p>A state visit by Donald Trump to the UK in September is being viewed as a potential opportunity to strengthen strained relations between the two countries. Despite Trump's divisive nature and policy disagreements, British officials believe his fondness for the Royal Family and the pomp of a state visit could provide vital diplomatic clout. The visit, dubbed a "fest" by Trump, is seen as a way to influence him on key issues like Ukraine and to pursue an elusive economic deal on tariffs. The UK government is hoping that its "soft power" can help navigate the challenges posed by Trump's presidency.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial for orforglipron, a once-daily GLP-1 pill for diabetes and weight loss. The trial demonstrated that the pill effectively lowered A1C levels in adults with Type 2 diabetes and resulted in significant weight loss. The most common side effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues. Eli Lilly plans to seek FDA approval for orforglipron as a Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026 and for weight management by the end of this year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <h2>Fire Services Receive Less Funding Than Police for Tax Rise Coverage</h2>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a funding shortfall because the government is providing them with less compensation for tax increases compared to the police. While police forces will have their national insurance contribution rises fully covered, fire services will only receive top-up funds covering 50% of the increase on average. The National Fire Chiefs Council estimates that fire services will be £20m short of the £40m needed to cover the increases. This shortfall may result in cuts to fire service budgets and impact their ability to keep communities safe.</p>
