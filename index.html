          <p>Music icon Ozzy Osbourne, the pioneering frontman of heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. His death, announced by his family, prompted an outpouring of tributes from former bandmates, fellow musicians, and fans worldwide who remembered him as a trailblazer and cultural icon. Figures like Tony Iommi, Metallica, and Sir Elton John shared heartfelt condolences, celebrating his energetic performances and profound influence on the rock genre. Osbourne's passing came just weeks after Black Sabbath played their final farewell concert in their hometown of Birmingham, marking the end of an era for heavy metal.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Bullpen Collapses in Sloppy Loss to Minnesota Twins</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 01:38:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a dismal 10-7 defeat against the Minnesota Twins, largely due to a catastrophic bullpen performance. In the sixth and seventh innings, Dodgers relievers issued a series of walks, allowing the Twins to score six runs on only two hits and turning a tie game into a significant deficit. The meltdown included a particularly confounding play where a pitcher's errant throw to first base allowed three runners to score, highlighting the team's ongoing struggles. This loss marks a new low point for the Dodgers in what has been a difficult July, compounding issues from an out-of-sync offense.</p>

          <p>Laurent Mekies is set to take over as the new team principal for Red Bull's Formula 1 team, following the dismissal of Christian Horner. Mekies, an experienced engineer, is expected to bring a different, less adversarial leadership style to a team that has faced competitive decline and internal turmoil. His immediate task is to stabilize the team and reverse its performance slide, which has seen them struggle against rivals like McLaren. The change in leadership offers a chance for a cultural reset at Red Bull, moving away from Horner's controversial tenure and aiming to rebuild the team's spirit and competitive edge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes lowering the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto imports to 15% from the previous 25%. Trump described the agreement as "massive," stating that Japan would also open its markets to more American goods, including cars, trucks, and agricultural products, and invest $550 billion in the United States. The deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, potentially strengthening his leadership amid domestic challenges. The announcement comes after a period of declining Japanese auto exports to the U.S. due to the higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile is experiencing significant strain from overtourism, a problem symbolized by the presence of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous street. Residents report that the influx of tourists has displaced essential local businesses like grocers and butchers, making daily life more difficult for the local community. The rise in short-term holiday lets has also contributed to a decline in the number of families in the area, with the local primary school seeing a 29% drop in enrollment. While tourism supports over 40,000 jobs, locals feel the city has gone too far in prioritizing visitors over its residents.</p>

The situation is further complicated by U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies, which affect both trading partners. While there is mutual interest in countering some U.S. measures, analysts believe largely irreconcilable differences will limit any significant cooperation between the EU and China. The EU's own ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. could also influence its stance towards Beijing, making the summit's outcome highly uncertain with low expectations for major breakthroughs.</p>

This move has sparked public outrage and concern from EU officials, as fighting corruption is a key requirement for Ukraine's EU accession and for maintaining Western aid.

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence that a formidable "terror bird," a top predator standing taller than a human, was killed by an even larger reptile 13 million years ago. An analysis of a fossilized leg bone found in Colombia revealed teeth marks that match those of an extinct, five-meter-long caiman species. Since the bite marks show no signs of healing, researchers believe the bird either died in the attack or was scavenged shortly after death. This rare finding provides a fascinating glimpse into the interactions between two apex predators and suggests the fearsome terror birds were more vulnerable than previously thought.</p>

The rapid sequence of events has been condemned by Democratic senators as a blatant attempt to undermine judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who murdered four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has entered a guilty plea, avoiding the death penalty but leaving many questions, including his motive, unanswered. The plea deal has brought conflicted feelings for the victims' families, with some expressing relief at avoiding a traumatic trial while others feel they made a "deal with the devil." The case, which drew intense national attention and fueled rampant online speculation, shocked the small college town of Moscow. Despite the legal conclusion, the community and the families are left to grapple with the mystery of why the criminology student committed the horrific crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office has advised that Chinese firms should become more deeply integrated with local economies in Southeast Asia. This recommendation comes as the U.S. cracks down on transshipments, where goods are rerouted through other countries to avoid tariffs, with President Trump warning of a 40% levy on products diverted through nations like Vietnam. By establishing genuine local operations rather than just using countries for transshipment, Chinese businesses can create more stable, long-term investments. This strategy would help them navigate unpredictable tariff policies and contribute more meaningfully to regional economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tragic explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deceased were identified as elite, long-serving members of the department's Arson Explosives Detail. Preliminary information suggests the blast may have occurred while the deputies were working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a location in Santa Monica the previous day. The incident marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, and a multi-agency investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the fatal explosion.</p>

          <p>A sheriff's officer in Jacksonville, Florida, has been suspended after a viral video showed him punching a driver during a traffic stop. The driver, William McNeil Jr., posted footage of the officer smashing his car window and striking him. Police later released bodycam footage showing McNeil had refused commands to exit his vehicle after being pulled over. While a state prosecutor found no criminal misconduct by the officers, the sheriff's office has stripped the officer of his duties pending an internal review, stating that citizens must comply with commands even if they disagree with the stop.</p>

          <p>Authorities have released more details about a fiery, three-vehicle crash in Poway, California, that killed five people. The collision occurred when a pickup truck, traveling at high speed, crossed into oncoming traffic and struck a Honda Civic head-on. A third vehicle, a Toyota Tacoma, was then unable to stop and collided with the Honda. All five individuals in the three vehicles were pronounced dead at the scene, and the force of the impact sparked a small brush fire. Investigators are still determining why the pickup truck veered into the opposite lane and are reviewing video from a passing vehicle.</p>

          <p>The family of a man who died at Castle Hill Hospital following a heart procedure claims the hospital tried to cover up a medical error by issuing two different death certificates. The initial certificate mentioned a failed TAVI procedure, but it was later replaced with one that omitted this detail. An unpublished review by the Royal College of Physicians, seen by the BBC, was highly critical of the care the patient received, grading it as "very poor" and noting the death certificate was inaccurate. This case is part of a broader police investigation into a cluster of deaths related to the same procedure at the hospital.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list with elbow inflammation after he exited a recent game with a "stinging sensation" in his forearm. While the loss of the key reliever is a blow to the team's already strained bullpen, there is optimism that the injury is not season-ending. Scott reported feeling better the day after the injury, and the team is awaiting a full review of his MRI results. The situation highlights the Dodgers' need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the trade deadline to bolster their pitching staff for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>A musician from Worcestershire has criticized the police for what she felt was an inadequate and slow response after she reported being a victim of cyberflashing. Anna Downes received unsolicited pornographic images from a man she had met once professionally, but she felt ignored and forced to investigate the crime herself after reporting it. It took nearly six months and intervention from the BBC for the case to be transferred and for the perpetrator to be arrested and convicted. The case highlights the challenges victims face in getting cyberflashing, which became a specific crime in 2023, taken seriously by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed its national sports governing bodies to comply with President Trump's executive order that effectively bars transgender women from competing in women's sports.

The move follows a similar policy change by the NCAA and has been condemned by groups like the National Women's Law Center as sacrificing the needs of athletes for political demands, escalating the nationwide battle over the issue.</p>

A spokesperson for Obama swiftly retorted, calling the allegations "bizarre," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction." The accusation reignites the long-standing and politically charged debate over the origins and legitimacy of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
