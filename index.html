        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the Trump administration believes the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles is still necessary, despite waning protests over ICE raids. Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of inciting violence during the protests, claiming Newsom is endangering law enforcement. Newsom's office criticized Vance's visit, particularly his misidentification of Senator Alex Padilla. The article also mentions increased ICE enforcement efforts and President Trump's focus on the Israel-Iran conflict back in Washington. The ongoing situation highlights the tension between federal and local authorities regarding immigration enforcement. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to center on increasing defense spending by European allies, a key demand of President Donald Trump. Secretary General Mark Rutte aims to avoid conflict with the U.S. by addressing Trump's concerns, though divisions remain on trade, Russia, and the Middle East conflict. While Trump has consistently criticized NATO allies for insufficient spending, some European nations are already boosting their defense budgets due to both Trump's pressure and concerns over Russian aggression. The summit's brevity and focus on specific topics are intended to minimize visible disagreements among member states. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, months after his arrest by ICE. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was detained under charges that Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences." The judge expressed skepticism regarding the government's justification for detaining Khalil and suggested his arrest was related to his protests. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his release allows him to reunite with his family. </p>

Trump dismissed European efforts to mediate, stating Iran only wants to speak with the U.S., but Iran has so far rebuffed direct negotiations. Sharp differences exist between Israeli and American assessments of Iran's nuclear capabilities, and Trump has expressed distrust for his own intelligence community. Analysts warn that giving Iran more time could allow them to advance their nuclear program, while the State Department is providing assistance to Americans seeking guidance on the security situation in the region. </p>

          <p>Rapper Fat Joe is being sued by his former hype man, Terrance “T.A.” Dixon, for $20 million, with allegations including coercion, intimidation, and sexual relationships with minors. The lawsuit claims Fat Joe underpaid Dixon, failed to credit him for contributions to album tracks, and ran a criminal organization based on violence. Dixon alleges he was forced into performing sex acts with women in front of Fat Joe and his crew, and that Fat Joe had sexual relationships with underage girls. Fat Joe's attorney has called the allegations fabrications and a retaliatory attack following a slander lawsuit filed by the rapper against Dixon. </p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions lost to Argentina in a thrilling Dublin contest, spoiling their pre-tour warm-up. Argentina scored breakaway tries through Ignacio Mendy, Tomas Albornoz, and Santiago Cordero. Despite the Lions hitting back with tries from Bundee Aki and Tadhg Beirne, Cordero's decisive score secured Argentina's victory. The Lions will now travel to Australia, having lost their tour opener for the first time since 1971. </p>
          <p>50/100</p>
