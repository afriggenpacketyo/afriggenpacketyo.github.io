          <p>A significant explosion occurred at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, resulting in fatalities and injuries. The blast caused extensive damage to nearby buildings and vehicles, with residents feeling the impact from miles away.

          <p>The arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan has sparked controversy, with accusations that the Trump administration is attempting to intimidate the judiciary. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments following Dugan's arrest suggest a broader message aimed at judges who oppose the administration's policies. Critics argue that the prosecution of Dugan is an effort to undermine judicial independence and discourage judges from challenging the administration's agenda, particularly in immigration cases, raising concerns about the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling. The guidance states that biological sex defines "woman" and "man" in law, affecting access to single-sex facilities. It clarifies that trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals and schools, and vice versa, but emphasizes the need to provide alternative provisions for trans individuals. The EHRC will conduct a consultation to refine the guidance further.</p>
