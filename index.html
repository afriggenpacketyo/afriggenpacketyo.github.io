          <p>A new HBO docuseries is bringing fresh attention to the 1991 'Yogurt Shop Murders' in Austin, a brutal and unsolved case where four teenage girls were killed. The crime, which involved the victims being bound, sexually assaulted, and shot before the shop was set on fire, has haunted the city for over three decades. Despite early convictions being overturned due to questionable methods, investigators are hopeful that renewed public interest and advanced DNA technology may finally bring justice for the victims and their families.</p>

          <p>Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, is set to sign an executive order to prevent city agencies and police from collaborating with federal immigration enforcement operations. This move comes in response to the Trump administration's plans for a crackdown in so-called "sanctuary cities," including a request for military base access near Chicago. The order explicitly states that Chicago police will not assist in joint patrols or arrest operations related to civil immigration enforcement, setting up a direct confrontation with the federal government's stated intentions.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has advanced its efforts to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi by making an improved offer of £35 million, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, requesting an additional £5 million in bonuses, and talks between the two clubs are ongoing ahead of the transfer deadline. With Guehi not intending to sign a new contract, Palace is seeking to sell him rather than lose him on a free transfer next summer, while also actively trying to sign two replacement central defenders.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has recalled striker Nicolas Jackson from Germany, revoking permission for his medical with Bayern Munich just as he was about to complete a loan move. The decision was made after fellow Chelsea striker Liam Delap suffered a serious hamstring injury during a match, which could sideline him for up to eight weeks. The sudden collapse of the deal has reportedly angered Jackson, leaving Chelsea to manage the fallout while being unexpectedly short on fit strikers for the upcoming period.</p>

In a large-scale study involving over 200 GP surgeries in London, the device proved significantly more effective at identifying these conditions compared to traditional methods. The technology works by analyzing subtle sounds in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable by the human ear, potentially leading to earlier diagnoses and treatment for patients.</p>

While its polished filmmaking is a departure from the cheap, garish style of the 1984 Troma original, the review finds it to be a diverting and clever piece of schlock for a modern audience.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most trading partners represent an illegal overreach of his emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law used to justify the levies, does not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs. The decision, which Trump heavily criticized, has been stayed until mid-October to allow the administration to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a comprehensive, two-year study in Iowa identified agricultural pollution as a significant contributor to the state's serious water quality problems, public funding intended to promote these findings has been mysteriously withdrawn. The report, which connects pollutants to health risks like high cancer rates, has been controversial in the politically powerful farm state. Sources involved in the project state that over $400,000 earmarked for public awareness and outreach was "zeroed out" without explanation, raising concerns about efforts to downplay the results.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could seriously jeopardize the central bank's independence. She argues that politicizing the Fed could lead to long-term negative economic outcomes, including weaker markets, higher inflation, and a depreciated currency. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, Patterson believes the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy.

While the president has been active on his Truth Social platform, his lack of scheduled public events over the holiday weekend has continued to fuel rumors about his well-being.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs that emerged from the receding waters of the Mosul Dam reservoir, the country's largest. The tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old and dating to the Hellenistic period, became accessible for excavation as severe drought caused water levels to drop to historic lows. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for researchers to uncover historical sites before they are submerged again.</p>

The man was part of a group of British nationals who went into the water on Friday evening; when he failed to return to shore with the others, the alarm was raised. After a search by the coastguard proved unsuccessful, his body was later found lifeless on the shoreline. The UK Foreign Office has confirmed it is providing support to the man's family.</p>

          <p>The restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has reversed a recent rebranding effort, abandoning its new minimalist logo and restoring its traditional "Old Country Store" look. The decision came after the company faced a swift and intense backlash from conservative voices online, including Donald Trump Jr. and President Trump himself, who framed the change as an example of corporate "wokeness." The incident is being cited as another example of the MAGA movement's significant influence on corporate America, pressuring companies to align with its cultural values.</p>
