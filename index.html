          <p>A large-scale manhunt involving local, state, and federal agencies is ongoing for Michael Paul Brown, the suspect in a shooting that killed four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities have located the suspect's vehicle but he remains at large, with the search focused on the mountains west of the town. Brown, a U.S. Army veteran who lived next to the bar, is considered armed and dangerous, and residents have been urged to stay indoors. The incident has prompted responses from state and federal officials, highlighting the ongoing issue of mass shootings in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, has confirmed it is investigating former Department of Justice prosecutor Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The inquiry follows a request from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump constituted illegal political activity and interference in the 2024 election. This investigating body is distinct from the role Smith held and can only seek disciplinary action or refer findings to the DOJ, not bring criminal charges itself. Smith had resigned before either of his two indictments against Trump went to trial.</p>

          <p>The Tea app, a platform designed for women to anonymously share information and warnings about men in their dating pools, has suffered a major data breach. The hack exposed highly sensitive user data, including driver's licenses, private messages, and selfies, which were subsequently leaked online. This incident has raised serious safety concerns for its users and sparked a broader debate about the vulnerabilities of digital "whisper networks." The company now faces two class-action lawsuits over the breach, which affected users who signed up before February 2024.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of U.S. adults, particularly those under 30, are now regularly getting their news from TikTok, relying on "newsfluencers" and viral clips rather than traditional media outlets. The platform's algorithm-driven, short-form video format presents a new model for information consumption that prioritizes speed and engagement. This shift raises questions about journalistic standards, the potential for misinformation, and how complex events are conveyed through memes and brief summaries. Despite these concerns, creators on the platform are building massive followings by catering to an audience with a shorter attention span.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border, ruling that it cannot be used to deport migrants to countries where they would face torture or persecution. The D.C. Circuit Court panel affirmed that while the government has discretion over granting asylum, it must adhere to U.S. and international laws requiring protection for those at risk. The ruling partially upholds a lower court's decision, narrowing the ban's application and ensuring certain mandatory humanitarian protections remain accessible to migrants.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Frontiers in Psychology suggests that aligning your workout routine with your personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and long-term commitment to fitness. Researchers found correlations between the "Big Five" personality traits and exercise preferences. For instance, extroverts tend to enjoy high-intensity group activities, conscientious people prefer goal-oriented training like preparing for a run, and introverts gravitate towards solo exercises like yoga or running. The findings encourage individuals to experiment with different activities to find what best suits their disposition.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), just after the agency released a July jobs report showing a sharp slowdown in hiring. The report indicated weaker-than-expected job growth and included a significant downward revision for the previous two months. Trump, without evidence, accused the Biden-appointed commissioner of manipulating the numbers for political purposes. The unprecedented move was immediately condemned by economists and policy experts, who warned it politicizes a nonpartisan agency and undermines the integrity of crucial economic data.

They argued that firing a statistician over unfavorable but accurate numbers is problematic and impetuous, highlighting a significant break with the president on the integrity of federal institutions.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump addressed the possibility of pardoning music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was convicted on federal prostitution-related charges. Trump stated that a pardon is "more difficult" because Combs made "terrible" and "very hostile" statements about him during his political campaigns. Despite calling Combs "sort of half-innocent" after his acquittal on more serious charges, Trump indicated that personal feelings and past criticism could cloud his judgment on the matter, suggesting a pardon is not a straightforward decision for him.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe reveals a dramatic disparity in the amount of rental space a budget of $1,500 per month can secure across major U.S. cities. The report highlights that this amount gets a renter an average of just 216 square feet in Manhattan, while the same budget can afford an average of 1,329 square feet in Wichita, Kansas. This stark contrast underscores the deep affordability divides in the national housing market, with expensive coastal cities offering minimal space compared to more affordable markets in the Midwest and South.
