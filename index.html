          <p>A White House report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. identifies ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, and excessive prescription drug use as major contributors to the chronic disease crisis among American children. The report criticizes corporate influence on federal policymaking and suggests a shift from treatment-focused research to understanding disease causes and prevention. However, the article notes that the report has drawn scrutiny for misrepresenting scientific consensus on vaccines and failing to address critical issues like gun violence and substance abuse among teens. The report calls for further investigation into the links between vaccines and chronic disease despite studies that have failed to find such a link.</p>

Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's rise reflects investors seeking alternative stores of value.

          <p>This article discusses the potential for annuities to run out of money, emphasizing that it depends on the type of annuity. While immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide guaranteed income for life, fixed-term annuities, variable annuities tied to investment performance, and annuities with withdrawal riders can be depleted. The article advises readers to choose lifetime income annuities, diversify retirement income sources, and research the financial health of the issuing insurance company to mitigate risks.

Critics argue that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest, while the White House maintains his assets are in a blind trust.

          <p>Zurab Japaridze, a leader of Georgia's largest opposition party, has been placed in pre-trial detention amid a government crackdown on critics. The move follows massive protests last year and accusations that the ruling Georgian Dream party rigged the 2024 parliamentary election. Japaridze refused to appear at an inquiry into alleged crimes committed between 2004 and 2012 and denounced the probe as illegitimate. The opposition accuses Tbilisi of mimicking authoritarian tactics and steering the country away from Europe.</p>

          <p>Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict an above-average number of storms during the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season. They expect 13 to 19 storms to form between June 1 and November 30, with 6 expected to be full-blown hurricanes and 3 to 5 major hurricanes. Climate change is contributing to more powerful storms due to abnormally high sea surface temperatures and a warmer atmosphere. The article notes the absence of FEMA officials at the annual hurricane forecast announcement, raising concerns about preparedness.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, returning almost all titles to the shelves after a review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The new review identified only about 20 books that need to be removed pending further review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal follows a Pentagon memo setting a deadline for military services to remove books touching on diversity, race, and gender issues. The initial Navy search used its own terms, identifying a broader range of titles.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move that is contested as to whether Republican lawmakers may have the right to make. The waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act gives Congress the ability to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, but Democrats argue that such a vote is illegal. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked in the 50 years it has had the ability to enact them, and will sue the federal government.</p>
