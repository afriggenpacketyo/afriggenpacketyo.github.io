          <p>This Fox News opinion piece criticizes CNN's Jake Tapper for his book on the Biden administration, arguing that Tapper relies too heavily on insider sources who have a vested interest in portraying themselves in a positive light. The author contends that Tapper and his co-author, Alex Thompson, prioritize insider information over readily available evidence, leading them to be deceived by sources pushing their own agendas. The piece suggests that journalism has become overly focused on uncovering hidden truths rather than accurately reporting on observable events, and accuses Tapper and Thompson of doing public relations for Democrats. The author concludes that Americans have little reason to trust journalists who act as mouthpieces for those in power. </p>

The Israeli military has intensified its operations in Gaza in recent days, announcing strikes on over 100 targets in a single day.

          <p>Former President Trump has again criticized Harvard University regarding its international students, days after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll them. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING" for their education. This attack follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order against the administration's revocation, which Harvard argued was a violation of the First Amendment. The university asserted that the revocation was punishment for rejecting government demands to control Harvard's governance and curriculum.</p>

Graham Parsons, who taught philosophy and military ethics at West Point for 13 years, said that the administration's executive order ending DEI programs in the armed forces amounted to indoctrination rather than education. Parsons stated that the administration is dictating which areas of inquiry are legitimate, which represents a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education, effectively banning his research agenda and sending a message to cadets that dissent is not acceptable.</p>

Republican senators, however, have expressed skepticism about the bill's impact on the deficit and signaled plans to modify it.

The Trump family and its business partners have collected millions through ventures like a new cryptocurrency and overseas real estate deals. The article notes that the gift of a luxury jet from Qatar, intended for Trump's use, highlights the scale of these financial dealings. The article concludes that Trump has dismantled accountability measures, leaving critics struggling to gain traction without the usual mechanisms of official review.</p>

          <p>The Labour government cannot guarantee that train tickets will get cheaper under renationalisation, even as South Western Railway (SWR) was brought into public ownership. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that the focus will be on improving services and infrastructure, as the day-to-day running of trains is already heavily subsidized by the taxpayer. The government plans to renationalise nearly all passenger rail services in England by 2027. However, members of the public have questioned the point of renationalising train operators if it does not reduce prices.</p>

          <p>Dr. Timothy Johnson, long-time ABC News medical editor and founding editor of the Harvard Medical School Health Letter, criticizes the Trump administration's recent budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health. Johnson argues that these cuts, totaling more than $1.8 billion, will cause terrible damage to research programs and destroy the careers of young medical scientists. He warns of a potential "brain drain" as researchers seek positions in other countries, and calls for a more surgical approach to finding savings without destroying the research infrastructure.

          <p>The Trump administration has continued releasing people charged with being in the country illegally to non-governmental shelters along the US-Mexico border after previously telling those same organizations that providing immigrants with temporary housing and other aid may violate a law used to prosecute smugglers. Fema suggested shelters may have committed felony offenses related to bringing people across the border illegally or transporting them within the US. Shelters are now in the awkward position of doing something that Fema appeared to say might be illegal. Fema has suspended payments during its investigation, which requires shelters to provide "a detailed and descriptive list of specific services provided" and executive officers must sign sworn statements that they have no knowledge or suspicions of anyone in their organizations violating the smuggling law.</p>

China’s years-long anti-corruption crackdown has intensified its focus on industries – such as big data, semiconductors and tech giants – all of which it sees as strategically important in its drive towards self-reliance amid its deepening rivalry with the United States. Earlier this month Li Gang, director of the province’s National Defence Science and Technology Industry Office and the former chief engineer at the Guizhou Big Data Development Administration, was placed under investigation by the local anti-corruption watchdog on suspicion of “serious violations of discipline and laws” – a standard euphemism for corruption.</p>

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has a central weakness in that it focuses on individual species rather than ecosystems, making it vulnerable to changes in the definition of harm. The author suggests that an ecosystem-protection act could be a unifying cause, as love for American landscapes is bipartisan. It would also recognize that ecosystems are dynamic and can adapt to climate change, supporting and protecting most of America's species without the need for individual plans.</p>

That's why I've developed a new parenting framework — one that I believe works better than the rest — rooted in what children need most but rarely receive: emotional safety. The goal is to be deeply attuned to your child's emotional needs. I teach parents not just how to manage their children's behaviors, but also to help them build emotional resilience, trust and connection through open and honest conversations.</p>
