          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Nio experienced a significant surge in its Hong Kong-listed shares, extending gains for a seventh consecutive session. This rally follows the recent unveiling of its new ES8 SUV, priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, making it one of the company's most affordable models. This strategic shift aims to broaden Nio's customer base amidst mounting pressure and intense competition within China's electric vehicle sector, where the company traditionally targeted the high-end market. The introduction of more accessible models, including its new brands Onvo and Firefly, is crucial for Nio's growth, with ES8 deliveries set to begin in late September. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights persistent racial disparities, where Black infants face more than double the risk of dying before their first birthday. This urgent declaration facilitates quicker action to address critical gaps in care, including expanding prenatal services and strengthening community health programs. Experts stress that underlying issues like structural inequities, poverty, and federal funding cuts to vital CDC initiatives, such as PRAMS, are major drivers of this tragic crisis, demanding a multi-faceted approach.</p>

          <p>Russian officials reported that Ukrainian drones caused an overnight fire at a nuclear power plant in the Kursk region and struck other power facilities, coinciding with Ukraine's Independence Day. The fire at the nuclear plant was quickly extinguished, with a transformer damaged but radiation levels remaining normal and no injuries reported. The UN nuclear watchdog acknowledged media reports but had not independently confirmed the incident, emphasizing the need to protect all nuclear facilities. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over its territory, while Ukraine's air force reported shooting down or jamming 48 of Russia's 72 drones and decoys.</p>

          <p>A limited number of National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. have begun carrying their assigned service weapons, a directive issued by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This action signifies an escalation in President Trump's federal intervention into the capital's policing, despite local data indicating a decline in violent crime over the past year and a half. The troops, initially unarmed and primarily tasked with protecting landmarks and crowd control, are now operating under established Rules for the Use of Force, which permits weapon use solely in response to imminent threats. This development raises significant questions regarding the Guard's role and the necessity of such measures.</p>

France firmly rejected the claims, asserting its full mobilization against antisemitic acts since October 7, 2023, which it deeply regrets.

Luckey contends these "smart weapons" are morally superior to "dumb weapons" that cannot differentiate targets, and that a strong autonomous defense acts as a deterrent.

          <p>Ecuadorian asylum seekers, fleeing extreme cartel violence and extortion, are now hiding from US authorities due to increasingly restrictive immigration policies, as detailed in this article. Many, like Gabriela, who lost a family member to cartel brutality, face challenges proving persecution under US asylum law, which often doesn't neatly categorize cartel violence. Under the Trump administration, policies have made it harder to seek asylum from gang violence and have expanded deportations, with concerns that even coerced payments to cartels could be seen as "material support." This creates a climate of fear and limbo for millions awaiting asylum decisions, with many living in constant anxiety of arrest or deportation.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France has been associated with over 70 recognized medical miracles by the Catholic Church in the last 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. This article explores the rigorous investigations conducted by the Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, where world-renowned doctors scrutinize claims of cures over decades. Led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, the office applies strict criteria, including sudden, complete, and lasting recovery with no possible medical explanation according to current medical knowledge. Despite skepticism regarding historical rigor, external analyses, such as one by Dr. Esther Sternberg, have found the office's conclusions to be credible, confirming the thoroughness of their process.</p>

          <p>New evidence related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, including a video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol and a pilot's equation, was allegedly withheld from FBI field agents and top intelligence officials for years. The article details how this evidence, discovered during a raid on Omar al-Bayoumi's UK apartment in 2001, never reached key investigators, including those leading the San Diego 9/11 probe. Bayoumi, identified as a Saudi intelligence operative with ties to hijackers, claims the video was for tourism. Experts, however, believe it was pre-operational surveillance, raising profound questions about a significant intelligence failure and potential Saudi government involvement in the attacks.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized President Trump's plan to deploy federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it a "manufactured crisis" and an abuse of power. The Pentagon confirmed planning is underway for the deployment, which Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also condemned as a "flagrant violation of our constitution" and an attempt to create an "occupied city." The article highlights that this move follows similar deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, despite statistics showing a significant decline in serious crime in many American cities. Democrats argue Trump is "playing games with the lives of Americans" to create a distraction and override local authority.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a move that a senior defense official confirmed without providing a reason. This firing, along with the removal of other senior military officials, has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who described it as another instance of the Trump administration treating intelligence as a "loyalty test." The article suggests the ousting may be linked to the DIA's assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which reportedly contradicted President Trump's more absolute public statements. DIA employees expressed widespread concern about the politicization of their work, indicating a morale impact within the agency.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) reportedly prohibited a resident from charging a visiting family member's Tesla in their driveway, not due to safety concerns, but because the charging cord was deemed aesthetically unpleasing. The HOA letter cited "Electrical chords running along the ground" as impermissible, despite the homeowner using standard Tesla-supplied equipment and no extension cords. The article highlights widespread criticism of the HOA's overreach, with many online commenters suggesting the board was "full of sh*t" and misinterpreting electrical codes. This incident exemplifies HOAs' reputation for micromanaging and prioritizing aesthetics over practical homeowner needs, sparking debate about homeowner rights versus community rules.</p>
