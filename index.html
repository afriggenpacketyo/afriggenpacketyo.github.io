            <h2>China Urges US to Cancel Tariffs Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the U.S. to completely cancel tariffs as trade tensions between the two countries persist. The Trump administration announced a pause on global tariffs but increased levies on Chinese imports. The U.S. Commerce Secretary suggested that exemptions for technology products would be temporary, while President Trump stated there was no exemption. The comments inject uncertainty into the tariff situation. The Chinese commerce ministry has called the exemptions a "small step" and is evaluating the impact. Optimism score: 30</p>

            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have no immediate plans to speak amidst the escalating trade war between the two countries. Greer emphasized that the U.S. is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade, and that China chose to retaliate, leading to the current situation. He also mentioned that the administration is prepared for the possibility that China could sell assets it holds in the United States. He clarified that the recent exemptions are a shift from the reciprocal tariff regime to the national security tariff regime. Optimism score: 20</p>
