The company recorded a gain on investment of 434.9 billion yen, a significant drop from the 724.3 billion yen booked previously, though the fiscal fourth quarter saw a gain of 26.1 billion yen, boosted by ByteDance's valuation. The overall Vision Fund segment logged a pretax loss of 115.02 billion yen, impacted by the declining value of companies like AutoStore, despite gains from investments in Didi and Coupang.

          <p>Honda Motor reported a 76% plunge in operating profit for its fourth quarter, falling short of earnings estimates due to the anticipated impact of U.S. tariffs.

The company has downgraded financial projections for the current fiscal year, citing significant impacts from global tariff policies. Despite these challenges, Honda plans to increase its dividend per share and is adjusting its production strategies to mitigate tariff effects, as well as changing their dividend policy from a dividend payout ratio to a 'dividend on equity'.</p>

          <p>A man seeks advice on estate planning in his second marriage, where his wife wants their shared estate to go to her children, while he intends to leave his inheritance to his biological daughters. Experts suggest setting up a trust, such as a QTIP or A-B trust, to manage assets and ensure both sets of children are provided for. Naming children as beneficiaries or creating transfer-on-death deeds can also be used, but it's important to consult with an advisor to structure trusts and leverage life insurance policies effectively.

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling in recent months. Regular earnings growth has slowed but remains above the rate of inflation, while job vacancies have also decreased. Experts suggest that rising business taxes and the minimum wage may be contributing to the softening employment. The Bank of England faces a challenge in balancing interest rate cuts with concerns over sticky wage growth and inflationary pressures, highlighting the complexities of managing the UK economy.</p>

          <p>Many cities are attempting to encourage citizens to switch from cars to public transport to reduce pollution and congestion.
