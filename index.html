          <p>NATO allies are set to commit to increasing their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, as urged by the U.S., with ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Middle East tensions driving the need for greater security. However, some member states are hesitant to meet the target, raising concerns about the fulfillment of these pledges. European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for concrete government procurement to scale up production capacity. The U.S. is seeking clear plans and commitment from allies to reach the 5% target, while some European allies may attempt to dilute the spending pledges.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is planning to establish a clinic offering ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, providing an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to release an updated report on psychedelics, including ketamine, later this year, and the hope is that ketamine assisted therapy will soon be available on the NHS.</p>

          <p>Western leaders are calling for diplomacy amidst escalating conflict involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran, but are criticized for failing to address the root causes of the conflict. They are accused of being passengers in Israel's war, unwilling to question its actions or hold it accountable. The leaders' responses are seen as complacent and detached from the realities of the situation, including violations of international and human rights law. The article suggests that this reveals a lack of moral compass and a prioritization of tribal supremacy over universal values.</p>
