          <p>The Walt Disney Company has partnered with Miral to develop a new Disney theme park and resort on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. This will be Disney's seventh theme park resort, with Disney's imagineers leading the creative design and operational oversight, but Disney will not be investing capital into the project. The park will feature themed accommodations, dining, and retail experiences that blend Disney storytelling with Abu Dhabi's culture. Yas Island is already a hub for entertainment and retail, hosting attractions like Ferrari World and Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an electronic warfare technology that uses networked 1-bit jammers to create the illusion of a fleet of warships, potentially tricking enemy missiles into pursuing these "ghost" fleets. This technology, detailed in the Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, aims to protect real warships by diverting enemy missiles and avoiding radar detection. The system involves four electronic warfare devices circling a ship, sending signals to deceive advanced radar systems from a distance, thus enhancing the defensive capabilities of the People's Liberation Army Navy.</p>

          <p>Many Afghans living in the U.S., including those who aided U.S. forces, fear being deported due to changes in immigration policies and the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS). With the State Department closing the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, many Afghans with tenuous legal status worry about their safety if returned to Afghanistan. Immigration attorneys advise Afghan residents to avoid expressing negative opinions about the current administration on social media, fearing they could be targeted for status revocation.

          <p>Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's chancellor after an initial failed vote, marking a rocky start to his leadership. He now faces the challenge of addressing economic stagnation, internal divisions over migration, and geopolitical tensions regarding defense spending.

          <p>Uber reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, but revenue fell slightly below estimates, causing shares to drop. The company saw a 14% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, driven by growth in both its ride-hailing and delivery businesses. Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, highlighted the company's progress in autonomous vehicle technology, with an "annual run-rate" of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. Uber faces a lawsuit from the FTC over billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi defends as simple to cancel.</p>

          <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule, suggesting that a player should only be considered offside if their entire body is beyond the last defender. Wenger compared the suggested change to a similar move taken after the 1990 World Cup. He argues that the current use of VAR has eliminated the advantage previously given to attackers, leading to frustration, and that this adjustment would restore some of that advantage and encourage more goals.</p>

          <p>As President Trump proposes increasingly steep tariffs, corporate executives are growing resigned to them, adopting the mantra that "ten percent is the new zero." While initial announcements of tariffs ranging from 10% to 60% caused market panic, the subsequent scaling back has led to a begrudging acceptance of the remaining tariffs. This reflects a psychological effect known as anchoring, where extreme initial proposals make the final outcome seem more palatable, however, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warns that many small businesses might not survive. The United States still has a 10 percent “universal” tariff in effect on most imports globally, as well as 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, metals and goods from Canada and Mexico.</p>

These remarks are in reference to the economic hardship that is inevitable due to his tariffs. Critics argue that these comments are reminiscent of Jimmy Carter's austerity appeals and signal a troubling shift towards anti-growth policies, which are at odds with the Republican party's traditional pro-growth stance. The article suggests that Trump's rhetoric aligns more with an anti-capitalist worldview, potentially alienating capitalists.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its worst measles outbreak this century, with cases spreading across multiple states and a rising death toll. This resurgence is attributed to declining vaccination rates, fueled by anti-science sentiments and the influence of vaccine skeptics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 111 new infections in the week starting March 30 — the single worst week for new measles cases in the US since the 1990s. The situation underscores the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease.</p>
