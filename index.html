            <p>A federal court has temporarily blocked the mass termination of staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) following the Trump administration's move to lay off a significant portion of the agency's workforce. Judge Amy Berman Jackson's ruling puts a legal hurdle in front of the layoffs, which allegedly were managed by a staffer from Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency." Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the move as an assault on consumers, suggesting Musk aims to benefit his financial services platform, X Money, by dismantling the CFPB.</p>

The Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act last month to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador, arguing that the Tren de Aragua gang is a "hybrid criminal state."</p>

The author argues that conservatives should be wary of expanding the use of the 1983 Supreme Court decision, Bob Jones University v. United States, which allows the IRS to revoke tax exemptions from organizations whose activities are contrary to settled public policy. The author argues that this could lead to tit-for-tat reprisals and is a terrible case for modern textualists. Conservatives should oppose its impetuous new use.</p>

            <p>The Australian government is facing criticism for shooting koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park. The government claims the program is intended to end the koalas' suffering from burns and starvation following a bushfire that destroyed their food source. Critics argue that habitat loss due to logging and development, combined with climate change-induced wildfires, are the root causes of the koalas' plight. Some experts question the humaneness of aerial culling, advocating for rescue and rehabilitation as the primary approach.</p>

            <p>Power has been restored to nearly all customers in Puerto Rico following an island-wide blackout that occurred earlier this week. Luma Energy reported that over 98% of customers had electricity restored within 48 hours of the outage. The blackout was triggered by a transmission line failure, causing generators to shut down. Outages have been a chronic problem for Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria in 2017, exacerbated by a lack of maintenance and investment in the power grid.</p>

            <p>The FDA is reportedly planning to end most of its routine food safety inspections, outsourcing this oversight to state and local authorities. The FDA spokesperson says this claim is false. Some officials suggest this shift could free up resources for higher-priority and foreign inspections, however steep layoffs at the office's support staff is expected to result in cutbacks to the number of inspections that can be done by the agency. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico.</p>

Some packs of lercanidipine, manufactured by Recordati Pharmaceuticals, have been wrongly labelled as containing 10mg tablets when they contain 20mg pills. Patients are urged to check their medication and contact their GP or pharmacist if they have the wrongly-labelled medication.

The sanctions mean the companies will not be able to do business with Ukraine and any assets they have in the country will be frozen. Zelenskyy this week claimed he had intelligence that China was sending weapons, including gunpowder and artillery, to Russia. China has repeatedly denied it is sending fighters or weapons to Russia.</p>
