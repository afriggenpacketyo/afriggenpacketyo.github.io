          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index jumped to a new record, crossing the 44,000 mark for the first time, following the announcement of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation. The market rally reflects investor optimism that a new leader from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party might introduce a significant fiscal stimulus package to boost the nation's economy. This positive market movement in Japan occurred as broader Asia-Pacific markets traded higher, tracking gains on Wall Street led by technology stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom.

Israeli police reported that two attackers were neutralized at the scene by a security officer and a civilian. The attack has been condemned by Israeli leaders, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing harsh measures and declaring a "full-scale war against terror." Hamas praised the attack, calling it a natural response to the ongoing conflict, which continues amid stalled ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has increased by 46% between 2021 and 2023, as legalization spreads and social stigma diminishes. Many seniors are turning to cannabis, often in the form of edibles, to manage issues like chronic pain, PTSD, and anxiety. However, some medical professionals express concern, warning that THC, the main psychoactive compound, may pose cardiovascular risks regardless of the method of consumption. Despite these warnings, many older users view it as another option in a world of conflicting health advice.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, named the Coches 2 fire, broke out Monday afternoon in the Lakeside community of San Diego County, prompting evacuation orders and damaging multiple structures. The blaze, which started near Interstate 8, grew to over five acres before firefighters were able to halt its forward progress. At least one civilian injury has been reported, and an evacuation center was established at a nearby casino for displaced residents. The full extent of the damage to homes and property is still being assessed as crews work to contain the fire.</p>

          <p>The expiration of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 50,000 Hondurans is raising concerns about its impact on the U.S. healthcare system, particularly the home health aide sector.

Supported by Attorney General Rob Bonta, the measure seeks to protect consumers from purchasing sick or poorly bred animals and to promote the humane treatment of animals.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family succession dispute has concluded with a $3.3 billion settlement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp. and News Corp. The agreement resolves a legal battle initiated after Rupert Murdoch sought to amend his family trust to ensure his oldest son would lead the media empire. As part of the resolution, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will relinquish their shares and roles in the companies, receiving financial payouts into a new trust, effectively ending their influence over the conservative-leaning media assets.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the 59-year-old man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump last September, has commenced in Florida with jury selection. Routh, who is representing himself in court, is charged with staking out Trump's golf course with a semiautomatic rifle with the intent to kill him. Despite the gravity of the charges, the proceedings have been marked by Routh's eccentric behavior, including submitting unusual questions for potential jurors. Prosecutors allege he fired on an FBI agent before fleeing the scene, leaving behind a note confirming his intent.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration's strategy of complete denial regarding a suggestive 2003 letter to Jeffrey Epstein has backfired now that the letter has been released by House Democrats. By labeling the letter's existence a "despicable hoax" and suing The Wall Street Journal for defamation, the White House left no room for alternative explanations or nuance. The article suggests this approach, while rallying some supporters, has now become a significant credibility problem for the administration, as the evidence appears to contradict their vehement claims.</p>

          <p>The resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba after less than a year in office highlights the country's ongoing political instability, marking the third leadership change in five years. Ishiba stepped down following poor election results driven by public discontent over a party corruption scandal and a rising cost of living. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party now faces another leadership contest, with potential candidates including Sanae Takaichi and Shinjiro Koizumi, as the next leader will need to address a weakened party, economic challenges, and complex foreign relations.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing industrial growth, China has made significant strides in combating pollution through a green technology revolution, according to environmental researchers. The country has seen dramatic improvements in air and water quality over the last decade, with a 35.6% reduction in PM2.5 air pollution from 2015 to 2022. This progress is attributed not to deindustrialization but to the widespread deployment of cutting-edge environmental technology, real-time monitoring systems, and massive investments in green infrastructure, enabling industrialization-driven decarbonization.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has reversed a lower-court injunction, thereby permitting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Los Angeles to use factors like "apparent race or ethnicity" and speaking Spanish for immigration stops. The ruling, issued from the court's "shadow docket," allows agents to continue practices that critics argue amount to racial profiling. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor condemned the decision as a "grave misuse" of the emergency docket that risks creating a "second-class citizenship status" for many Americans and legal residents.</p>
