          <p>Following a recent terrorist attack that killed 26 people, residents in Pakistani-administered Kashmir are bracing for a possible military confrontation between India and Pakistan, reinforcing bunkers and stocking supplies. Prime Minister Modi has pledged severe punishment for the attack's perpetrators, while Pakistan claims to have intelligence of an imminent Indian strike. The tourism industry, a key economic driver for the region, has been severely impacted by restricted access and canceled vacations. Local authorities have also closed religious seminaries, citing concerns they could be targeted in airstrikes, highlighting the pervasive sense of unease and preparation for potential conflict.

          <p>A head-on collision on a Kansas highway resulted in the deaths of eight people, including two high school students, a former teacher-coach, and a school employee from Oklahoma.

          <p>According to an Oxford Economics report, China has not significantly reduced its reliance on the U.S. dollar, despite trade tensions and a push to resist Washington's influence. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and the country has few viable alternatives for its $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. Rather than selling U.S. assets, China is more likely to weaken its currency, the yuan, to support exporters during the trade war, making a disruptive sale of U.S. Treasury holdings unlikely.

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial has commenced in New York, with jury selection underway for charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, which could lead to a life sentence if convicted.

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that Labour's decision to restrict winter fuel payments negatively impacted the party's support in recent local elections, with voters expressing unhappiness over the cuts. The government had restricted the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits in an effort to save Â£1.4bn. Labour Welsh First Minister Baroness Eluned Morgan has called for a rethink of the policy, with conversations taking place in No 10 about how to address public concern. The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997 as a universal payment for all pensioners, but was restricted last year.</p>

The university stated the protesters were covering their faces and stacking furniture, and that those who remained in the building would face legal and student conduct actions.

          <p>Michigan football head coach Sherrone Moore is expected to be suspended for two games next season due to allegations of failing to cooperate in the NCAA's investigation into the program's sign-stealing scandal during Jim Harbaugh's tenure. The suspension is anticipated during the Wolverines' third and fourth games of the season, and the program may also face a self-imposed sanction. The NCAA prohibits schools from sending scouts to opponents' games and using electronic devices to record other teams' signs. Before becoming head coach, Moore was accused of deleting text messages with Connor Stalions, a former staffer allegedly involved in the sign-stealing, though he has stated he is cooperating with the NCAA.</p>

The Bundestag has 14 days to elect Merz or another candidate by an absolute majority, with a second vote planned for Wednesday. The far-right Alternative for Germany party seized on his failure and called for fresh elections, while Merz's camp remains hopeful for a second-round victory.</p>

The administration claims the offer is a dignified route and could lead to a legal pathway back to the U.S. for those deemed desirable.

          <p>U.S. stock index futures declined on Tuesday due to President Trump's plans to announce pharma tariffs, which intensified concerns about the impact of a trade war. Ford Motor also contributed to market unease by suspending its annual outlook and citing a $1.5 billion hit from tariffs. The Federal Reserve is set to begin its two-day meeting, and policymakers' comments will be closely monitored for clues about potential monetary policy easing this year. The tariffs on the film and pharma industries are undermining the "likely misplaced" optimism that markets feel about the U.S. striking trade deals in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumers are seeing prices decrease for certain goods and services, including airfare, produce, household items, electronics, and gasoline, despite overall inflation not reaching policymakers' target. Analysts attribute these declines to idiosyncratic factors, such as seasonal supply-and-demand dynamics and increased efficiency in manufacturing consumer electronics. Lower diesel fuel costs have also contributed to reduced transportation expenses for produce, though tariffs threaten to reverse these trends.

          <p>Colombian authorities have arrested more than 200 suspected members of the Gulf Clan, the country's largest drug cartel, accused of murdering two dozen security force members in the past month. President Petro has accused the group of systematically targeting security forces, prompting a response that has resulted in numerous arrests, deaths, and the seizure of drugs and weapons. The cartel is believed to pay its members for killing police officers, and engages in illegal gold mining, racketeering, and migrant smuggling. The arrests come amid heightened violence in Colombia, as the government struggles to maintain peace with various armed groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the US ending a duty-free loophole, Chinese retailers Temu and Shein are likely to focus more on Europe, exploiting the EU's de minimis exemption to sustain their low-cost model. The influx of cheap goods raises concerns about product safety, with many Chinese goods failing EU safety standards. The European Commission is considering stricter controls and handling fees on Chinese parcels to address compliance costs and VAT fraud. France is already stepping up inspections on low-value goods entering the country, implementing a management fee on each parcel.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating a 2022 traffic stop involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. Federal investigators questioned a convicted felon about potential connections to Abrego Garcia, who was driving the felon's vehicle during the stop. The investigation is focused on whether Abrego Garcia was involved in transporting undocumented migrants, despite the lack of criminal charges from the traffic stop. This scrutiny comes as the administration faces court deadlines to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., after his erroneous deportation.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is considering a proposal to bar anyone without a Social Security number from collecting benefits on behalf of retired, disabled, widowed, and low-income individuals, potentially impacting 170,000 beneficiaries. This proposal would affect representative payees who accept benefits on behalf of eligible beneficiaries, such as parents of disabled children who are U.S. citizens. Critics argue that the proposal is rooted in misinformation and may be jarring for American citizens who rely on their representative payees.

          <p>Former Labour MP Mike Amesbury attributes Labour's recent election losses, including losing his former seat to Reform UK, to "big political mistakes" over benefit cuts by the government. Amesbury cited the decision to axe winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners and make it more difficult for people to claim personal independence payments (PIP) as key factors. He spent three nights in jail following his 10-week sentence being handed down at Chester Magistrates' Court on 24 February for assaulting a constituent, and said he has since been "treated for depression". Amesbury has apologised to Paul Fellows, the constituent he assaulted.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to offer a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage Americans to have more children is facing skepticism from experts, who argue that the one-time payment would not address the larger financial challenges of raising a family in the U.S. These challenges include unaffordable healthcare, soaring housing costs, inaccessible childcare, and a lack of federal parental leave mandates. Demographers and policy analysts suggest that more substantial policy changes are needed to address declining birthrates, such as affordable childcare and healthcare, and guaranteed paid family leave.
