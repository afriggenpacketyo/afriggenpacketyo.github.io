          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into seven major technology companies, including Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Snap, concerning the safety of their AI chatbots for children and teenagers. The probe aims to understand how these AI companions might negatively affect young users, particularly regarding simulated human-like relationships and the companies' monetization strategies. The FTC is also investigating measures taken by these firms to evaluate chatbot safety, their development of characters, and the handling of personal information, following prior reports of inappropriate AI interactions with minors.

          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest and announced a $100,000 reward in the ongoing manhunt for the killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot at Utah Valley University. Authorities describe the suspect as college-aged and have tracked his movements on campus, recovering a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to be the weapon used. Officials are analyzing forensic evidence, including a palm print and footwear impression, as the investigation continues into what Utah Governor Spencer Cox termed a "political assassination." The incident has prompted calls from President Trump to condemn political violence, as law enforcement works tirelessly to apprehend the individual responsible.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's personal fortune is now primarily derived from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI Holdings, rather than his stake in Tesla. A recent Tesla proxy filing revealed that a majority of his wealth, estimated between $385 billion and $436 billion, now comes from these other ventures, prompting Tesla to propose a massive new pay package to retain his focus. SpaceX's valuation is nearing $400 billion, and xAI's could reach $200 billion, with Musk holding significant voting control in both. This shift highlights the competing demands on Musk's attention and the complex financial dynamics influencing his various enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hyundai's CEO, José Muñoz, announced that construction of its Georgia battery plant, a joint venture with LG Energy Solutions, will face a two-to-three-month delay. This setback follows an immigration raid where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained approximately 475 workers, including over 300 South Koreans, suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally. Muñoz noted the challenge of replacing these specialized workers, many of whom are not in the U.S., impacting the plant's timeline. The incident has also sparked diplomatic concerns, with South Korean officials suggesting it could deter future investments in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A chartered plane carrying over 300 South Korean workers, who were detained in a U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery plant in Georgia, has departed for South Korea. The workers were among approximately 475 individuals suspected of living or working illegally in the U.S. The incident triggered a significant diplomatic standoff between the U.S. and South Korea, a major investor in American manufacturing. While most South Koreans are voluntarily departing, the raid has caused a two-to-three-month delay for the battery plant and sparked discussions between the two governments on future visa-related issues and investment policies.</p>

          <p>Italy's Filippo Ganna secured victory in a shortened individual time trial during stage 18 of the Vuelta a Espana cycling race, while Joao Almeida gained time on overall leader Jonas Vingegaard. The stage was reduced from 27.2km to 12.2km due to heightened security concerns following a series of pro-Palestinian protests during the three-week event, which also saw police numbers increased and two protestors detained. Ganna's strong finish edged out Jay Vine, but the general classification battle remains tight with two competitive stages remaining.

Known for his polarizing views on gender, race, and gun control, Kirk's death prompted tributes from Trump and highlighted his significant influence within the conservative youth movement.

          <p>Millions of Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% to 2.8% increase in their monthly checks in 2026, according to new estimates based on August inflation data. This projected cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) would raise the average retirement benefit by approximately $54-$54.70 per month, a slight increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025. However, retirees express concern that these adjustments may not fully offset rising essential expenses, including potential increases in Medicare Part B and Part D premiums.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is under pressure to explain the funding of an £885,000 Clacton constituency home purchased by his partner, Laure Ferrari, without a mortgage. A BBC investigation found no evidence supporting Farage's claim that Ferrari's wealthy French family funded the purchase, raising questions about potential tax avoidance. Farage denies providing funds and insists Ferrari is the sole owner, but he has sought specialist legal advice on the transaction. The controversy has led to accusations of hypocrisy, particularly after Farage criticized former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner over similar stamp duty issues, highlighting scrutiny over politicians' financial affairs.</p>

The violations involved protected health information from Onduo's diabetes program being used in research, marketing, and conferences, with affected clients including Walgreens, Highmark, and Delta Air Lines.

The administration's "department of government efficiency" (Doge), led by Elon Musk, had overhauled the NSF, specifically targeting grants mandated for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM. A coalition of scientific organizations challenged these cuts, arguing they violated administrative and constitutional laws, but the court found it lacked jurisdiction or that plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm.
