          <p>Tesla's shares experienced a significant drop of 14% following President Trump's threat to withdraw government contracts from Elon Musk's companies, intensifying their public dispute over a recent spending bill. The stock decline pushed Tesla's valuation below the $1 trillion mark. Trump claimed that Musk was unhappy about the exclusion of electric vehicle credits in the bill and that Musk's behavior led to Trump asking him to leave his administration. Musk countered by asserting his importance in Trump's election victory, further escalating the tension between the two figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has implemented a new travel ban restricting entry to the U.S. for nationals from 19 countries, citing national security concerns and the risk of visa overstays. The proclamation, effective June 9, affects individuals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and other nations, with partial restrictions on countries like Cuba and Venezuela. Exemptions are in place for green card holders, dual nationals, athletes, diplomats, and close relatives of U.S. citizens. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory and politically motivated, particularly as it excludes countries with close business ties to the Trump family, while also citing an attack in Boulder, Colorado, as justification for the measure.</p>

CrowdStrike's Charlotte AI is gaining traction as an agentic security analyst, and analysts agree that AI agents expand the IT surface area that requires protection.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously blocked Mexico's lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers, a case centered on whether the companies could be held liable for violence caused by drug cartels. The lawsuit argued that the manufacturers contributed to the violence by supplying guns to retail dealers who then illegally sold them to Mexican gun traffickers. This decision reinforces the protections provided by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally shields gunmakers from liability for the misuse of their products by third parties. The court's ruling emphasizes the need for more direct actions by manufacturers to promote criminal activity to overcome PLCAA's protections.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have surpassed 100,000 during President Trump's second term, reflecting an intensified effort to detain unauthorized immigrants across the U.S. The agency has increased its daily arrests significantly, targeting individuals in courthouses, worksites, and communities, aligning with the administration's goal of stricter immigration enforcement. This surge in arrests is occurring alongside requests for increased funding to expand detention capacity and hire additional deportation officers. These aggressive tactics have sparked outrage and confrontations, as ICE detains both immigrants with criminal records and non-criminal migrants, reversing previous restrictions that focused on serious criminals and national security threats.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has officially launched, offering a higher-resolution screen and more processing power, but maintaining a similar design to its predecessor. The showcase game, "Mario Kart World," introduces new features like "Knockout Tour" and a "free roam" setting, receiving positive early impressions. A tutorial game, "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour," is available for purchase, but its value as a standalone title is questionable. The Switch 2 is largely backward compatible, and data transfer from the original Switch is relatively simple, though the price point and potential for tariffs remain concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's new travel ban has been designed to avoid the legal pitfalls that plagued his initial attempt. The original travel ban faced numerous legal challenges, with critics labeling it a "Muslim ban" due to its targeting of predominantly Muslim countries. The new ban, however, is more legally robust, with wider scope and clearly defined exemptions, potentially increasing its chances of being upheld by the Supreme Court. The current ban targets 12 countries, mainly in the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean, with partial restrictions on seven additional countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The response to President Trump's latest travel ban has been less intense compared to his initial attempt, possibly due to a desensitization among critics to the administration's policies. While condemnation has been voiced, the outrage lacks the same fervor as the 2017 "Muslim ban," reflecting a shift in the Overton window of political acceptability. Experts believe that legal challenges to the new ban are less likely to succeed due to its varied character and the time taken in its preparation. The ban is seen as part of a broader xenophobic sentiment, manifested in mass deportations and attacks on civic institutions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of U.S. gun manufacturers, dismissing a lawsuit brought by Mexico. Mexico had sued several American gun companies, claiming their products were sold to gun traffickers who supplied Mexican drug cartels. The Court's decision upholds the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which provides broad immunity to gunmakers from lawsuits seeking to hold them liable for harms caused by the misuse of firearms by third parties. The ruling emphasizes that simply knowing guns are being resold illegally is not enough to overcome PLCAA's protections.</p>
