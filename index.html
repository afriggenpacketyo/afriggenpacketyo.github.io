          <p>Donald Trump praised Washington D.C.'s Democratic Mayor, Muriel Bowser, for her collaboration with his administration's federal crime crackdown. He contrasted her cooperation with the approaches of other Democratic governors and mayors, asserting that the joint effort has led to a significant reduction in crime in the nation's capital. According to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the initiative has resulted in nearly 1,600 arrests and the seizure of 165 illegal firearms, with Trump suggesting similar deployments could occur in other cities.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of threatening his country's sovereignty, claiming a significant U.S. naval deployment in the Caribbean is a prelude to "regime change." The U.S. has described the operation as an anti-drug trafficking mission, but Maduro views it as a direct military threat, vowing "maximum preparedness" to defend Venezuela. The situation is further complicated by neighboring Guyana's support for the U.S. presence amid ongoing territorial disputes over the oil-rich Essequibo region.</p>

The team features 11 of the 12 players from the previous squad, with Rasmus Hojgaard being the only new member, replacing his twin brother Nicolai. Donald emphasized that this continuity is crucial for facing the expected hostile "bear pit" atmosphere at Bethpage in New York, as Europe aims for its first away victory since 2012.</p>

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas after the jet ski he was riding collided with another vessel in the waters off Paradise Island. The Royal Bahamas Police Force is investigating the incident, which occurred on Sunday morning. This event follows other recent incidents involving American tourists in the area, including an alleged sexual assault at a resort and another non-fatal jet ski crash. The U.S. Embassy had previously issued a security alert in April warning citizens about the risks associated with renting jet skis in Nassau.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized reported comments from EU chief Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius called the public discussion of such topics "completely wrong" before any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have occurred, emphasizing that the EU lacks jurisdiction for troop deployment. His remarks highlight divisions among Western allies regarding the nature and timing of long-term security commitments to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story to protest a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders schools to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of her iconic novel "The Handmaid's Tale" from some school libraries. In her new story, Atwood criticizes the ban and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, describing "very good children" who grow up without any biological realities. The move is part of a growing debate over book censorship in Canada.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from the University of Montpellier indicates that human influence, particularly since the Middle Ages, has caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals. While domesticated species like sheep and chickens have grown larger due to selective breeding, wild species such as foxes and deer have shrunk. Scientists attribute the decrease in wild animal size to habitat fragmentation and intensified hunting. The study, which analyzed over 225,000 animal bones, highlights the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>
