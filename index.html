          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region showed mixed results, diverging from Wall Street's performance as investors analyzed new economic data. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined after Tokyo's core consumer prices rose at a slower pace but remained above the central bank's target. In South Korea, the Kospi fell following the indictment of former first lady Kim Keon Hee on corruption charges. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, ahead of a key summit where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has officially ended its tariff exemption for imported items valued at $800 or less, a policy that had been in place since 1938. Effective immediately, all goods shipped to the United States will be subject to tariffs, a move intended to support domestic retailers and curb the influx of potentially unsafe goods and illicit drugs. For a transitional six-month period, postal services can opt to pay a flat duty per package. This change has prompted dozens of foreign postal services to suspend parcel shipments to the U.S., citing insufficient time to adapt to the new collection and documentation requirements.</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has submitted a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This new referral alleges misrepresentations on mortgage and government ethics documents related to a condominium in Massachusetts. The move comes as Cook is suing President Donald Trump to block his attempt to fire her from the central bank's board. Pulte's actions are seen as part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to exert pressure on the Federal Reserve, which has so far resisted demands to cut interest rates.</p>

Yoon himself faces separate charges of insurrection, highlighting a period of significant political turmoil and legal challenges for the country's former leadership.</p>

          <p>Officials state the individual who attacked a Minneapolis church school, killing two children and injuring 18, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children" but lacked a specific motive. The 23-year-old suspect, who previously attended the school, used three legally purchased firearms and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Investigators found notes expressing hatred towards various groups, leading the FBI to classify the attack as an act of domestic terrorism motivated by a hate-filled ideology.

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, have asked a federal judge to prevent top Trump administration officials from making prejudicial public statements about him. The motion claims that officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have made "highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements" that violate his right to a fair trial on human smuggling charges. Garcia was released from pre-trial custody only to be detained again by ICE for possible deportation. His lawyers argue the government's public attacks could taint any potential jury pool and intimidate defense witnesses.</p>

          <p>A new video analysis indicates that Israeli forces struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack, contrary to initial reports of two strikes. The investigation found that two staircases were hit almost simultaneously, followed nine minutes later by a rapid double-strike on an area where first responders and journalists had gathered. The attack reportedly killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. The Israel Defense Forces' narrative has evolved since the incident, and it has not yet acknowledged carrying out more than one strike on the hospital facility.</p>

The protest was organized by a group of current and former tech workers demanding Microsoft cut ties with Israel over its reported use of the Azure cloud platform to surveil Palestinians. The company stated the terminations were due to serious violations of policy and creating safety concerns. Microsoft has launched an investigation into Israel's use of its technology to ensure compliance with human rights principles.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone assault on Kyiv killed at least 15 people, including four children, and wounded dozens more in one of the largest attacks on the capital in weeks. The attack damaged numerous civilian buildings, including a residential block and a building housing the European Union Delegation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate killing of civilians and called for stronger international sanctions against Russia. The attack comes amid struggling U.S.-led peace efforts, with Ukrainian officials accusing Moscow of avoiding serious negotiations while escalating its military campaign.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Fresno restaurant chain has been charged with hiring a motorcycle gang member to set his underperforming restaurant on fire to collect insurance money. Prosecutors allege Robert Salazar increased the insurance policy on his closed Blackstone Avenue location before arranging the arson in April 2024, which resulted in a payout of nearly $1 million. An accomplice seen on surveillance video told investigators that Salazar had paid her and the gang president to commit the crime. Investigators also noted Salazar has an alleged history of arson, including previous incidents involving a former employee and a former brother-in-law.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the DNA of the Druids Oak, an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, to understand the genetic basis for its remarkable resilience and longevity. By analyzing the genomes of approximately 50 ancient oaks across the UK, researchers hope to identify genes that help them survive threats like climate change and disease. This knowledge could be crucial for selecting the most robust saplings for future planting, aiding efforts to restore Britain's depleted woodlands. Ancient oaks are vital ecological cornerstones, supporting over 2,300 species of wildlife.</p>

          <p>An investigation has uncovered an international network of spammers using AI to create and post fake images of Holocaust victims on Facebook to generate profit. These low-quality, fabricated images and stories, dubbed "AI slop," attract high engagement, which is monetized through Facebook's content programs. Organizations like the Auschwitz Memorial have condemned the practice, stating it disrespects victims, distresses survivors, and dangerously distorts history. The investigation tracked many of these accounts to content creators in Pakistan who are gaming the platform's monetization system by targeting high-value Western audiences with emotionally manipulative content.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. Until now, parents had to pay for the vaccine privately. Ministers hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children. Chickenpox is typically mild but can cause serious illness in some individuals, including pregnant women and infants.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has overruled a school board decision to display Israeli flags on all campuses, citing student safety concerns. The board had approved the measure as part of a resolution to combat antisemitism, but the plan stirred controversy. Supporters saw it as a sign of solidarity with the Jewish community, while critics argued it was an inappropriate political statement for a public school and could make campuses a target. The superintendent invoked his executive authority to halt the display, stating that only U.S. and California flags will be permitted for now.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before initiating the largest reorganization of English councils in decades. Instead, the ministry of local government based its projection of £2.9 billion in savings on a 2020 report commissioned by the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings or even cost money, depending on the final structure. Critics find it astonishing that the government embarked on such a significant reform without independent, up-to-date evidence to justify its financial claims.</p>

While U.S. citizens and green card holders are exempt, critics argue the law will subject anyone perceived as being from these countries to unfair scrutiny.
