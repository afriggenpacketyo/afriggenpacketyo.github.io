          <p>The New York Knicks are reportedly interested in Jason Kidd as a potential replacement for their head coach, Tom Thibodeau. Because Kidd is currently under contract with the Dallas Mavericks, the Knicks would need to formally request permission to speak with him. Kidd had previously interviewed with the Knicks in 2020 before Thibodeau was hired. Kidd has prior head coaching experience with the Nets and the Bucks, and he also served as an assistant coach for the Lakers. </p>

          <p>Recent Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in dozens of deaths, occurring during the Eid al-Adha holiday. Humanitarian groups, including UNICEF, are decrying the worsening humanitarian situation, with increasing rates of acute malnutrition among young children. James Elder of UNICEF highlighted a severe lack of medical supplies and reported children suffering from malnutrition, saying that some of the children he has seen may not survive the week. He criticized the current aid distribution methods, claiming aid is being used as bait, and that military contractors are running distribution points where people are being killed while trying to access the aid.</p>

The eaglets, born in March, have been practicing for their first flights for several days, flapping their wings and jumping from branch to branch. While it's unclear where Sunny and Gizmo will go, young eagles tend to return to the nest soon after their first flight and will likely remain in the habitat for one to three months.</p>

They allege they were arrested and brutally tortured; however, Tanzanian officials deny the accusations, claiming the activists violated law and order.

          <p>Cardiologists are raising concerns about the potential harm of excessive phone scrolling on heart health. Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can increase anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior. Over time, this habit can lead to neglecting heart-healthy activities like exercise, sleep, and stress regulation. Cardiologists recommend setting time limits, avoiding scrolling in bed, and replacing the habit with healthier alternatives to protect heart health.</p>
