          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz delivered a keynote speech to the country's ambassadors, signaling a significant shift in Germany's foreign policy. Merz described a new systemic conflict between liberal democracies and an "axis of autocracies," primarily China and Russia, arguing that Germany can no longer afford to be an "island." He stressed that foreign policy must now be the basis for all other policy areas, especially economics, and should be guided by national interests. This change marks a move away from a purely values-based approach to a more pragmatic and assertive role on the global stage.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Vox, medical ethicist Ezekiel Emanuel critiques the public health agenda of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Emanuel argues that while Kennedy's focus on chronic diseases and nutrition is commendable, his actions, such as mass layoffs at the CDC and canceling mRNA vaccine funding, are dangerous and undermine public trust. He warns that weakening the nation's public health infrastructure will lead to long-term negative consequences, such as the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. The discussion highlights the deep divisions over public health policy and the challenges of finding bipartisan solutions.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has fired Peter Mandelson, the U.K.'s ambassador to the United States, following the release of new information about his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A government statement explained that recently revealed emails showed a relationship that was "materially different from that known at the time of his appointment." Specifically, Mandelson's suggestion that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful prompted his immediate withdrawal from the diplomatic post, highlighting the severe political fallout from any association with the disgraced financier.</p>

          <p>In a first-of-its-kind ruling in Europe, a Spanish court has sided with residents in the Galicia region who sued authorities over unchecked pollution from industrial pig farming. The claimants argued that nitrate runoff from massive amounts of pig waste has contaminated drinking water, destroyed local ecosystems, and violated their human rights. The court ordered regional authorities to compensate the residents, clean up the polluted river, and implement preventative measures. This case could set a significant legal precedent for other communities across Europe facing similar environmental challenges from industrial agriculture.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump on a golf course in 2024, is set to begin with opening statements. Prosecutors allege Routh had a methodical plan involving a military-grade weapon and burner phones, driven by political grievances. Routh has dismissed his lawyers and chosen to represent himself, though the judge has placed significant restrictions on his potential defense arguments. The trial revisits a high-profile instance of political violence from the 2024 election cycle, with Routh facing charges that could result in a life sentence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency NASA has officially blocked Chinese nationals from accessing its facilities, materials, and networks, effectively barring them from working on its programs. The move, confirmed by NASA, is intended to ensure the security of its work amid rising geopolitical tensions and an accelerating space race with China. This restriction adds to the decline in scientific collaboration between the two nations, as Washington has already excluded Chinese astronauts from the International Space Station. The policy reflects growing suspicion and competition for technological dominance between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Ghost, a giant Pacific octopus at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, has entered the final phase of her life, known as senescence. After laying a clutch of unfertilized eggs, she will now devote the remainder of her days to caring for them, a natural process that involves forgoing her own needs, including eating. Aquarium officials explained that this is a normal part of the species' life cycle, whether the eggs are fertile or not. Ghost will be moved to a behind-the-scenes habitat to live out her final months peacefully.</p>

          <p>A growing number of patients are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude to interpret their medical records and lab results, which are now more accessible through online portals. While some find AI helpful for understanding complex information and preparing questions for their doctors, physicians and patient advocates warn of significant risks. These include the potential for AI models to provide inaccurate information, or "hallucinate," and serious privacy concerns, as sensitive health data may not be protected. The trend highlights a need for a new type of digital health literacy among patients.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used the technology to observationally verify a key theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. The theory, known as the black hole area theorem, states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. By analyzing the gravitational waves from two colliding black holes, researchers confirmed that the resulting single black hole had a larger surface area than the sum of the two initial ones. This achievement, made possible by significant upgrades to LIGO detectors, marks a major milestone in physics.</p>

          <p>The race to become the next deputy leader of the U.K.'s Labour Party has narrowed, as both Emily Thornberry and Paula Barker have withdrawn their candidacies. Neither candidate appeared likely to secure the 80 nominations from fellow MPs required to advance to the next stage. Their withdrawal leaves Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson as the clear frontrunner, with former minister Lucy Powell as her closest rival. The contest was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner, and the winner will be announced in late October after a vote by party members.</p>

          <p>A survivor of the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon, Portugal, is sharing the story of her final moments with her husband, who was among the 16 people killed. Hind Iguernane said from her hospital bed that she and her husband, Aziz Benharref, swapped seats just before the tram departed, a decision that placed him in the spot that proved fatal. Iguernane, who suffered a fractured hip and shoulder, was in and out of consciousness after the crash and did not learn of her husband's death for two days. The tragic incident was attributed to a failed cable.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean nationals who were detained in a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia are being deported. The workers were part of a group of 475 people detained for alleged visa violations at an electric vehicle battery facility under construction. The raid, the largest single-site action in ICE history, has created diplomatic friction between the U.S. and South Korea, a key economic and political ally. South Korean officials have expressed deep concern over the treatment of their citizens and are negotiating for new visa categories.</p>

          <p>The Flanders Festival Ghent in Belgium has canceled a scheduled performance by the Munich Philharmonic because its conductor, Lahav Shani, is Israeli. Festival organizers stated they could not get sufficient clarity on Shani's stance regarding the Israeli government, which they termed a "genocidal regime." The decision has drawn sharp condemnation from German Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer, who called it "pure antisemitism" and an attack on European culture. The orchestra and the city of Munich also criticized the move as a form of collective punishment that attacks fundamental democratic values.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of Israel's campaign of targeted killings against its enemies across the Middle East since the Hamas-led attack in 2023. The report details the assassinations of high-ranking figures from Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps in locations including Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. It assesses the strategic impact of these strikes, noting that while they contributed to a ceasefire with Hezbollah, they have not ended the wars in Gaza or with the Houthis in Yemen. The analysis suggests the campaign has had mixed results in achieving Israel's long-term security goals.</p>
