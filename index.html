          <p>Mohamed Salah's quest to break the Premier League's goal involvement record continues after a mixed performance. Despite approaching his 400th appearance for Liverpool, Salah missed a significant opportunity in a recent match against Brighton. While he showed promise earlier in the season, his form has dipped, scoring only one goal and providing one assist in the last eight matches. Despite this, Liverpool's manager, Arne Slot, remains confident in Salah's ability to bounce back and secure the record, emphasizing his typically inhuman performance levels.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which has metastasized, has prompted questions about the timing of the diagnosis and whether it could have been detected earlier. Experts suggest that advanced prostate cancer can sometimes be difficult to detect early, particularly in older men, and it is possible that Biden chose to forgo regular PSA screenings, which are not always recommended for men over 70. The article explores the potential reasons for the late diagnosis, including the possibility of rapid cancer growth or borderline screening results, and notes that some men may not exhibit symptoms even with advanced cancer. The article also notes that the former President dropped out of the 2024 race after concerns over his age and health, leaving Kamala Harris to run.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent phone call with Vladimir Putin has exposed differing perspectives on potential peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. While Trump expressed optimism about immediate negotiations for a ceasefire, Putin emphasized the need to address the root causes of the war, reflecting Russia's stance on Ukraine's ties to Europe. The article suggests that the US might reduce its involvement in negotiations, potentially impacting military and intelligence support for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed concern about the US distancing itself from the peace process, highlighting the importance of continued American involvement. The article also notes that Trump is considering reduced sanctions and new trade deals as incentives for Putin to agree to a peace deal.</p>

The ship, ARM CuauhtÃ©moc, was on a good-will tour with 277 people aboard, including 175 naval cadets. Investigations are underway by the Mexican Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Transportation Safety Board to determine the cause of the accident, considering mechanical failure, tugboat involvement, or human error.

Executive Director Gene Seroka highlighted that the figures indicate a tariff-tinged shipping panic, with imports increasing and exports falling.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, which cited concerns about the government's growing debt levels. Despite Federal Reserve interest rate cuts last year, mortgage rates have remained high, tracking the 10-year Treasury bond's sensitivity to economic conditions. The market is likely to have already accounted for the nation's debt issues, limiting additional market impact, according to analysts at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Aspiring homebuyers face elevated mortgage rates and a shortage of affordable properties, with only a small percentage of listed homes being affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.â€™s announcement that he has aggressive prostate cancer has prompted an outpouring of well wishes and sympathy, as well as some whispered uncertainties that reflected a lack of trust in what he says about his health. In recent days, prominent Democrats had begun to self-examine their role championing Mr. Bidenâ€™s re-election bid despite his signs of aging and votersâ€™ clear preference for a younger candidate. Some accused him and his top aides of concealing his mental and physical decline, setting up a last-minute candidate switch that culminated in Democratsâ€™ defeat.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The judge ordered the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, stating that the officials who replaced him were "illegitimately installed." The court found that the administration's actions to dismantle USIP, including terminating board members and dispersing its assets, were unconstitutional. The judge also noted that Trump used force and threats of criminal process to take over USIP headquarters, despite the agency not being part of the government's executive branch.</p>

The credit-rating agency Moody's downgraded the nation's rating, citing concerns about federal spending and revenue.

The White House maintains that foreign countries should absorb these tariffs, but some companies have reported financial strain.
