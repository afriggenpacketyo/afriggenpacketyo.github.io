          <p>Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that family members of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect charged in the Boulder, Colorado attack, have been taken into ICE custody. Soliman, an Egyptian national, is accused of attempted murder and hate crimes for allegedly injuring multiple people at a march supporting Israeli hostages, with witnesses reporting he yelled "Free Palestine" and "End Zionist" during the attack. ICE plans to process Soliman's wife and children under expedited removal, leading to a federal judge temporarily blocking their deportation and setting a hearing for June 13.

          <p>Environmental groups argued before the California Supreme Court that the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) violated state law by cutting financial incentives for residential rooftop solar panels in 2022. The groups claim the CPUC did not consider all the benefits of solar panels and failed to ensure continued expansion in disadvantaged communities. Lawyers from the Attorney General's office defended the CPUC's decision, arguing that the credits for panel owners resulted in a cost shift to non-solar owners, particularly low-income customers.

          <p>Law enforcement agencies across 28 states have arrested hundreds of individuals as part of a national effort to curb rising rates of organized retail theft. The initiative, led by the Cook County regional organized crime taskforce in Illinois, involved over 100 law enforcement agencies and more than 30 major retailers, including Target, Macyâ€™s, and Walgreens. Organized retail crime involves coordinated theft operations, often reselling stolen goods for profit, and has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. The crackdown aims to deter such conduct through prosecution and serious enforcement.</p>

The MSPB, which hears claims from civil servants who believe they were illegally fired, lacks a quorum due to Trump's actions. The court suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, federal courts should step in to hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants, challenging the unitary executive theory and protecting civil service protections.</p>

          <p>The German government is seeking to simplify the process for declaring countries safe for asylum seekers, aiming to reduce the number of asylum applications. Chancellor Merz's Cabinet approved a draft policy that allows a country to be declared safe with a simple statutory order, eliminating the need for Bundesrat consent. This move is part of a broader effort to implement asylum reforms, but it has faced criticism from opposition lawmakers and NGOs.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has renewed his criticism of President Donald Trump's tax bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and urging Americans to pressure lawmakers to reject it. Musk asserts that the bill will increase the U.S. budget deficit and burden citizens with unsustainable debt, marking a widening rift between the two. The White House defended the bill, asserting that it will improve the fiscal trajectory of the United States and unleash economic growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>US Officials Assess Ukrainian Drone Attack on Russian Warplanes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 15:57:14 EDT</div>

          <p>U.S. officials assess that Ukraine's recent drone attack hit as many as 20 Russian warplanes, destroying around 10 of them, though this is lower than the Ukrainian President's estimate. Despite the discrepancy, the attack is considered highly significant, potentially influencing Moscow's negotiating position in peace talks. The Ukrainian operation, codenamed "Spider's Web," targeted four air bases across Russia, demonstrating Kyiv's ability to strike deep within Russian territory.</p>
