        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The late actor George Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently connected himself to Ohio politics when he made inaccurate statements about then-congressional candidate John Boehner on "The Arsenio Hall Show" in 1990. Wendt, whose brother-in-law was Boehner's opponent, Greg Jolivette, confused Boehner with then-Rep. Buz Lukens, who was embroiled in a sexual assault scandal. Wendt's comments led to a heated exchange between the campaigns, with Boehner's team accusing Jolivette of his own past transgressions. Boehner ultimately won the election and later became Speaker of the House, later recalling the incident with Wendt as a misunderstanding that they resolved, even sharing a drink together. </p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident prompted authorities to close the road and advise the public to avoid the area to prevent stings. Beekeepers assisted in recovering the hives and trying to save as many bees as possible. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee, and by the next morning, most bees had returned to their hives.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital flight to the edge of space from its West Texas launch site. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and witnessed the Earth from space before returning.

This marks Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight since July 2021, bringing the total number of people launched by the company to 68, continuing its dominance in the sub-orbital tourism market.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, seeking amendments to the agreement, which Israeli officials have already approved. The group aims for a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid, including the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official cited concerns over U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli troop withdrawal, while a U.S. envoy deemed the response "totally unacceptable." Meanwhile, the U.N. reports that desperate Palestinians intercepted and offloaded aid trucks due to severe food shortages amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing about the future of Hollywood's film and television industry in California, with a significant decline in production and job opportunities. The 2023 strikes by writers and actors led to the loss of approximately 40,000 jobs, and production has not rebounded significantly. Television production in the Los Angeles area has decreased by 58% since 2021, with many productions moving to other states and countries offering more attractive tax incentives. Governor Newsom is proposing to increase the state's film and TV tax credits, but some industry experts believe this may be insufficient to offset the high cost of working in California.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces unavoidable tough choices in its upcoming Spending Review, as it finalizes spending plans for public services. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other "unprotected" areas like transport and the criminal justice system. While spending increased in 2024, it is projected to slow down, necessitating difficult trade-offs. The government has committed to scrutinizing every pound spent, but concerns remain about funding for key initiatives such as increasing police numbers and capping bus fares.

          <p>A UN nuclear watchdog report reveals that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, prompting calls for Tehran to comply with the agency's probe. As of May 17, Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a short step from weapons-grade levels. The IAEA warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, raising serious concerns. In response, the U.S. sent a "detailed and acceptable proposal" to Iran, urging them to accept it, while Israel condemned Iran's actions and called for international action.</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend promoting a "McMigraine Meal" of coke and fries as a migraine cure is being questioned by experts. While some individuals report that the caffeine and sugar in coke, or the salt in fries, can provide temporary relief, experts caution against relying on fast food as a regular treatment. Migraines are complex neurological conditions, and fast food can contain triggers like Tyramine, potentially worsening symptoms. Experts recommend lifestyle changes and medical treatments, advising against relying on unverified social media hacks.</p>

The acronym "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) represents the idea that Trump's implicit pitch to swing voters is that anything extreme is also provisional. This approach allows him to test limits while reassuring voters that he is willing to pull back, enabling him to recover from political setbacks and maintain a normal level of popularity in a polarized country.</p>
