          <p>The United Kingdom is set to purchase twelve new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, signaling a significant expansion of its nuclear deterrent to match China and Russia. Prime Minister is expected to announce the purchase at the upcoming NATO summit in the Hague. This move is part of a broader National Security Strategy that prepares the UK for potential direct threats, including wartime scenarios, and will be equipped with US-owned nuclear warheads while Trident submarines remain the ultimate independent deterrent. Meanwhile, various newspapers also cover Donald Trump's use of strong language regarding the Israel-Iran conflict and Labour MPs' rebellion against welfare bill cuts. Optimism remains relatively stable in light of the UK's defense preparations. </p>

          <p>President Trump expressed fury after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which he brokered, was violated shortly after its implementation, leading him to use strong language publicly. A Pentagon report indicated that US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were less successful than initially claimed, potentially setting back the nuclear program by only a few months. In other news, ICE detentions are surging for immigrants without criminal records, contradicting the administration's stated priorities, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended holding interest rates despite renewed attacks from Trump. Also, a Department of Justice leader reportedly suggested defying courts over deportations, according to a whistleblower. The current international situation is creating some pessimism.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but voiced frustration after both countries were accused of violating the agreement shortly after it was supposed to take effect. Despite the initial violations, bombardments appeared to cease following Trump's intervention, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US Embassy in Jerusalem is set to reopen, but travel restrictions for US government employees remain in place. The conflict between Israel and Iran, which began on June 13, has resulted in at least 1,000 deaths, and drones have hit bases in Iraq housing US troops. The announcement of a ceasefire is a positive sign amidst the conflict. </p>

          <p>A brutal heat wave has settled across the eastern United States, with temperatures expected to soar to 15-25 degrees above average, and heat index values reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. Philadelphia experienced its first 100-degree day since 2012, and numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures are expected through Wednesday. Over 160 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with the total number affected rising to about 200 million. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome, and experts warn that the first heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous as the human body has yet to adjust to the warmer temperatures.

          <p>Daniel Park, arrested in connection with the deadly car bombing outside a California fertility clinic, was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. Park was indicted for Malicious Destruction of Property, stemming from his alleged role in the May 17 bombing outside the American Reproductive Centers facility in Palm Springs, which killed the bomber and injured four others. Authorities allege Park assisted the bomber by supplying chemicals and explosive materials, and the FBI has classified the bombing as an act of domestic terrorism, citing the suspects’ adherence to a radical ideology. The death of the suspect in custody is a sad turn of events. </p>

          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar's dominance amid faltering international confidence in the greenback. The People's Bank of China plans to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promote yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Recent moves include expanding tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies as collateral for yuan-settled trades. Despite global interest in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and geopolitical risks remain obstacles, while the yuan's global payment usage saw a slight decrease in May.

Despite the veteran's efforts to legalize his wife's status, ICE proceeded with the detention, leading to criticism over the agency's lack of discretion and disregard for military families.

The defense rested its case after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal, and lawyers are set to work with the judge on jury instructions before deliberations begin.

Experts say the data confirms that most arrests are made on the street, leading to allegations of racial profiling.

The average life expectancy in McDowell County is 12 years less than the rest of the U.S., and it has the highest drug overdose rate in the country.

          <p>Representative Brittany Pettersen brought her 5-month-old son Sam to a House Committee on Financial Services hearing, questioning Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell while holding him in her lap. Pettersen, who has been vocal about the challenges of being a new parent in Congress, used the opportunity to advocate for parental privileges for members of Congress. The event highlights the ongoing struggle for work-life balance and the need for more family-friendly policies in government. The inclusion of a baby in a congressional hearing is a positive step toward normalizing parenthood in the workplace. </p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board stated that "multiple system failures" led to the door plug flying off an Alaska Airlines flight in 2024, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes. The NTSB issued new safety recommendations to the FAA and Boeing, citing the need for better training, guidance, and oversight. The incident, which left a gaping hole in the plane, resulted in minor injuries to eight passengers. Despite the failure, the NTSB chair said she feels Boeing airplanes are safe, but there are ways to improve safety. </p>

Some senators have reviewed classified material related to the military operation, and caution is being urged in drawing conclusions at this stage.

          <p>A Georgia pastor, Rev. Jamal Bryant, has criticized his own church for accepting a $300,000 donation from Target following the retailer’s decision to phase out Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. Bryant, a driving force behind a boycott of Target, accused the National Baptist Convention of “selling out” and demanded the organization stand with him. Target stated it was “proud” to partner with the church to make a meaningful impact in communities, but Bryant is continuing the boycott until Target meets his demands, including fully committing to DEI and investing in the Black business community.

The author notes that the sheer number of accusations against politicians can desensitize voters, making them less willing to punish wrongdoing.

          <p>Boca Juniors were held to a 1-1 draw by Auckland City in the Club World Cup, failing to reach the knockout stage.
