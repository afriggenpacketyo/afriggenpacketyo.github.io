            <p>A US judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, can be deported based on a Cold War-era immigration law. The Trump administration argues that Khalil's presence in the US is adverse to American foreign policy interests due to his involvement in protests against the war in Gaza. Khalil's legal team has condemned the decision, arguing that it is politically motivated and based on unsubstantiated claims of antisemitism. The ACLU described the decision as "pre-written," highlighting the lack of concrete evidence presented against Khalil.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans in the US, potentially leading to their deportation. The Department of Homeland Security claims that conditions in Afghanistan no longer meet the requirements for TPS designation, despite ongoing conflict and instability. Advocates argue that the decision is cruel and undermines America's commitment to its allies, particularly those who worked with the US government during the war in Afghanistan. This move is part of the administration's broader effort to overhaul immigration policy and restrict protections for vulnerable populations.</p>

            <p>Experts warn that a prolonged US-China trade war could have devastating consequences for Africa, particularly if China's economy stumbles. US tariff policies could significantly impact African exports, especially from resource-rich countries like South Africa and those with clothing manufacturing industries under the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). While the US has paused "reciprocal tariffs" for most countries, increased tariffs on China could indirectly harm African economies dependent on trade with China. Kai Xue, a Beijing-based corporate lawyer, suggests that South Africa could be particularly vulnerable if tariffs are not rescinded.</p>
