          <p>Bubba Wallace secured a historic victory at the Brickyard 400, becoming the first Black driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's oval. The win, his third career victory, snapped a 100-race winless streak and marked his first triumph in one of NASCAR's crown jewel events. Wallace overcame a late rain delay, two overtime restarts, and fuel concerns to hold off a charging Kyle Larson by just 0.222 seconds. The achievement is a significant moment for Wallace and the 23XI Racing team, co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.</p>

          <p>A regional train derailed near Riedlingen in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, leading to at least three deaths and approximately 50 injuries, with 25 reported as severe. The train, which was carrying about 100 passengers, saw at least two of its carriages go off the tracks in a forested area. While the exact cause of the derailment remains under investigation, the region had experienced a severe storm earlier in the evening. Rescue operations are ongoing at the scene, located about 45 kilometers southeast of Ulm, as authorities work to assist the victims.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese player elected, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 99.7% of the vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He was enshrined alongside six-time All-Star pitcher CC Sabathia and dominant reliever Billy Wagner, who was elected in his final year of eligibility. Suzuki, known for his record-setting 3,089 MLB hits and 10 Gold Gloves, delivered a speech that humorously noted the one writer who left him off the ballot. The ceremony in Cooperstown also posthumously honored Dave Parker and Dick Allen, celebrating a diverse class of baseball legends.</p>

The 33-year-old Chelsea player was a crucial part of the Lionesses' championship run, playing nearly 600 minutes despite being in significant pain. Her resilience was particularly evident in the quarter-final, where she scored a key penalty, and in the final, where she played 105 minutes before being substituted. Manager Sarina Wiegman praised Bronze's "crazy mentality," highlighting her determination as an inspiration for the entire title-winning squad.</p>

          <p>While the absence of a major Marvel Studios panel in Hall H was a prominent headline, many attendees at this year's San Diego Comic-Con found the experience just as rewarding. For some, the lack of blockbuster panels made it easier to access other presentations, such as those for "Alien: Earth" and "Tron: Ares," without the famously long lines. Many fans emphasized that their enjoyment of the convention stems from cosplay, artist alleys, and exclusive merchandise rather than just major studio presentations. The event still featured significant moments, demonstrating that Comic-Con's appeal remains diverse and adaptable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Budget Director Russell Vought suggested that President Trump's recent criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the conservative policy blueprint known as Project 2025. When questioned about the project's chapter on overhauling the Fed, Vought claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says," despite being a key driver of the overall initiative. The Trump administration has focused its criticism on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the cost of a building renovation, which it alleges may be unlawful. Vought reiterated that the administration's primary demand is a rate reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michigan authorities are seeking to file terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing 11 people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect, identified as Bradford James Gille, allegedly used a folding knife in the random attack on Saturday, injuring five men and six women. Officials stated a terrorism charge is being pursued because the mass attack was likely intended to instill fear in the community. The suspect was confronted by multiple armed citizens in the parking lot, who prevented him from leaving before a deputy arrived and took him into custody.</p>

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed airdropping aid into Gaza after Israel announced a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in some areas to facilitate humanitarian convoys. Despite these measures, the World Health Organization warns that malnutrition in the territory has reached "alarming levels" and is on a "dangerous trajectory." Reports from the ground indicate continued violence, with medics reporting nine people killed by Israeli fire near an aid route. The UN and international leaders maintain that while airdrops help, sustainable land routes are the only viable long-term solution to the crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite the historic Euro 2025 victory by England's Lionesses, Downing Street reportedly has no plans to declare a national bank holiday to mark the occasion. This decision aligns with the precedent set after the team's 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. While an open-top bus parade and a celebration outside Buckingham Palace are scheduled for Tuesday, the government appears to be foregoing a day off, likely considering the economic cost. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had previously suggested he would be open to the idea, praised the team as "history makers" after their win.</p>

The article finds that many voters in middle America remain unfazed, prioritizing issues like the economy and border security over the Epstein controversy, and are willing to trust the former president. However, some Republican lawmakers report that the issue is a top concern among their constituents, indicating a divide within the base. The report suggests that while the story is a significant issue for some, others view it as less compelling.</p>

          <p>This cricket analysis expresses concern over England captain Ben Stokes' physical condition, noting he appeared to be struggling with injuries while bowling in the recent Test against India. The author argues that despite his importance to the team, no one can force Stokes to rest, and he must realize the need to protect himself for the bigger picture. The article highlights Stokes' crucial role, especially with the old ball, and states that England's future hopes in major series are massively diminished without him.

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed how a convicted fraudster, James Kenny, orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event was billed as a 45,000-capacity festival with a lineup supposedly including major acts like The Killers and Pulp. Kenny allegedly used forged documents and false claims of backing from prominent investors to lure in employees and suppliers, many of whom lost money when the scheme collapsed. The investigation details a pattern of deception, leaving a trail of unpaid bills and broken promises, with many questioning how the "festival made of paper" progressed so far.</p>
