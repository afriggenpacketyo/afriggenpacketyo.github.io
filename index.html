          <p>A mass shooting at a large house party in Maxton, North Carolina, tragically resulted in two fatalities, Jessie Locklear Jr. and Nehemiah Locklear, and left seven others in critical condition. A total of 13 people were shot in the incident, with victims' ages ranging from 16 to 49. The Robeson County Sheriff's Office reported that over 150 individuals fled the scene before law enforcement arrived, who were initially responding to a loud music complaint. Authorities have since stated it was an isolated incident with no ongoing threat to the community, but Sheriff Burnis Wilkins condemned the senseless gun violence involving teenagers, alcohol, and firearms.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Melissa has strengthened to a Category 1 storm, with forecasts indicating it will become a major hurricane and bring "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic early next week. The 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, Melissa is expected to intensify rapidly, potentially packing 140 mph winds and producing up to three feet of rain in mountainous areas, raising fears of mudslides. Hurricane warnings are in effect for Jamaica, and the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay is evacuating non-mission-essential U.S. citizens. The storm's slow drift northwest is projected to turn north towards Jamaica, then accelerate towards eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from Canada, citing a "fraudulent advertisement" by the Ontario provincial government. The ad, featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, aired during the World Series despite an agreement to pause it, which Trump called a "hostile act" and a "serious misrepresentation." This tariff increase follows Trump's earlier decision to halt trade negotiations with Canada, escalating economic tensions. The dispute unfolds as the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the President's authority to impose sweeping tariffs without congressional consent.</p>

          <p>England's women's football team suffered a friendly defeat to Brazil, leading to significant talking points about player performances and future strategy. Goalkeeper Khiara Keating made her debut at her childhood club's Etihad Stadium, becoming the first black female goalkeeper for the Lionesses, and despite an early 2-0 deficit, she delivered an assured performance praised by Coach Sarina Wiegman. The article also highlights the ongoing debate around Maya le Tissier's positioning, with Wiegman utilizing her at right-back despite her strong preference for center-back. This period marks the beginning of a new cycle for the Lionesses, focused on experimentation and preparation for the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Ole Miss Rebels head coach Lane Kiffin engaged in a post-game exchange with Oklahoma lineman David Stone after securing a gritty 34-26 road victory. Kiffin, captured on a hot mic, playfully reminded Stone of his earlier taunts about Oklahoma's defensive prowess. The No. 8 Rebels notably squandered a 12-point third-quarter lead against the No. 13 Sooners but rallied to shut them out in the fourth quarter. Key moments included a crucial 8-yard touchdown pass and a recovered punt return fumble that led to a decisive field goal, cementing Ole Miss's 7-1 record.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has achieved three consecutive victories, culminating in a 4-2 win against Brighton, prompting speculation that the team has overcome its recent struggles.

Key summer signings like Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are proving instrumental, contributing goals and a renewed attacking drive that aligns better with Amorim's tactical system.</p>

Confidence in his management of the economy and immigration, once key drivers of his support, has also fallen significantly.

          <p>A 13-year-old boy was hospitalized and lost part of his bowel after surgeons removed between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets he had ingested. The magnets clamped together inside his body, causing pressure necrosis in his bowel and large intestine. The case report highlights the severe dangers of these magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys and are significantly stronger than traditional refrigerator magnets. Despite a permanent ban in New Zealand, where the incident occurred, such magnets are readily available online, with the boy reportedly purchasing them from Temu.</p>

          <p>The popular "VOO and chill" passive investing strategy, centered on S&P 500 exchange-traded funds, is reportedly losing its appeal as investors seek greater diversification. Gavin Filmore of Tidal Financial Group notes clients are looking beyond index funds due to a lack of diversification within the S&P 500, where technology now comprises over 35%. Todd Sohn of Strategas Securities observes a renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months. This trend suggests a broadening of market interest beyond large-cap tech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and prominent Donald Trump donor, has been identified as the anonymous benefactor who contributed $130 million to help pay US military troops during the federal government shutdown. President Trump had previously described the donor as a "great patriot" and "friend" who preferred anonymity. While the Pentagon accepted the donation under its "general gift acceptance authority," critics, including Senator Chris Coons, raised concerns about potential violations of the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending unappropriated funds. Mellon, an heir to a Gilded Age banking family, is a significant political financier, having given over $165 million to support Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle.</p>

Member states face pressure to align with either superpower amid ongoing disputes over Taiwan and China's expansive claims in the South China Sea, which violate international law. Many ASEAN countries view the US as an unreliable partner due to Trump's tariff policies, while China's aggressive actions in the region are also a concern. Economically weaker nations often align with China, but larger countries like the Philippines and Indonesia attempt a delicate balancing act, maintaining economic ties with China while fostering defense cooperation with the US.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban posits that for the average individual, practical savings strategies like bulk shopping can be a more reliable "investment" than attempting to pick stocks. He illustrates that saving 40% on typical annual household consumable expenses, such as toothpaste and toilet paper, could yield $800 in tangible savings. Cuban also strongly advises against using credit cards for these purchases, emphasizing that an investment is only truly beneficial if it doesn't lead to accumulating interest debt.

Despite some voter skepticism about abandoning non-partisan maps, recent polls indicate a growing majority will vote yes, largely motivated by a desire to oppose Trump.
