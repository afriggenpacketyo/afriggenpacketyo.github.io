        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS News reports that despite inflation concerns, travelers can still save money on summer vacations by being flexible with travel dates and destinations, as flight and hotel costs have decreased slightly. NerdWallet's analysis indicates that airfares are down roughly 8% and hotel rates are down 2.4% compared to the previous year, offering potential savings for vacationers. However, costs for ride-sharing and entertainment have increased, so setting a budget for dining out and utilizing credit card rewards are recommended to mitigate unanticipated expenses and keep overall vacation costs down.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives worked through the night to reconcile Republican disagreements over President Trump's budget bill, which includes tax cuts, defense spending, and healthcare adjustments. Hard-line Republicans are pushing for deeper spending cuts, while others seek larger tax cuts, leading to a stalemate despite Trump's efforts to rally support. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would increase the national debt by $2.3 trillion over the next decade, raising concerns among fiscal conservatives, while Democrats oppose the bill due to its benefits for the wealthy and cuts to healthcare programs.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that a maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail, Sterling Williams, has been arrested for allegedly helping 10 inmates escape from the facility. Williams told investigators he was threatened by an inmate to turn off the water in the cell used for the escape, but his attorney argues he was merely performing his duties. The escape went unnoticed for several hours, and the sheriff's office is conducting an internal investigation, with the sheriff temporarily suspending her reelection campaign.</p>

          <p>The BBC assesses the government's progress on pledges related to illegal immigration and asylum, noting that small boat crossings have reached record levels. While the government aims to end the use of asylum hotels and disrupt people-smuggling gangs, the number of hotels used to house asylum seekers has increased, and it is unclear how progress on disrupting gangs will be measured. The government has increased decisions on asylum cases, but the overall backlog has risen, and the backlog of court appeals has also worsened.</p>

          <p>The South China Morning Post analyzes how Gulf states are navigating relations between the US and China, particularly following President Trump's visit to the region. The multi-trillion-dollar deals signed during his visit signal a pivot by Gulf states to deepen ties with the US, potentially impacting China's access to the petrodollar pipeline. Trump's focus on redirecting Gulf capital into US markets poses risks for Beijing, which has cultivated the Gulf as a critical partner for energy imports and infrastructure projects.</p>

The company negotiates with creditors to reduce debt amounts in exchange for lump-sum payments, but fees range from 15% to 25% of the enrolled debt. While it can reduce debt and offer an alternative to bankruptcy, it also damages credit scores and involves significant costs, so debt settlement should be viewed as a serious financial intervention.</p>
