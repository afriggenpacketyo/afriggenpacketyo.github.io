          <p>Holly LaFavers from Lexington, Kentucky, was shocked when 22 boxes containing 50,600 Dum-Dums lollipops were delivered to her apartment after her 8-year-old son, Liam, mistakenly placed a $4,200 order on Amazon thinking he was simply reserving the candy for a carnival he wanted to organize for his friends. Initially, Amazon refused to accept the return due to it being food, but after LaFavers posted about the incident on Facebook, gaining attention from local and national media, Amazon issued a refund and invited her and Liam to visit the Spangler Candy Co. factory, the makers of Dum-Dums. LaFavers decided to donate the lollipops to local charities, schools, and churches, while Liam's online browsing privileges have been temporarily suspended.</p>

          <p>A mistrial was declared in the case against Christopher Schurr, a former Grand Rapids, Michigan police officer, after the jury deadlocked following four days of deliberation in the 2022 fatal shooting of Patrick Lyoya during a traffic stop. Schurr, who is white, testified that he feared for his life when he shot Lyoya, a 26-year-old Black man, after Lyoya grabbed his stun gun during a struggle. The shooting, captured on video, sparked protests and racial tensions amidst national debates over police misconduct. The prosecutor has not yet decided whether to retry the case, while Lyoya's family expressed disappointment and vowed to continue fighting for justice.</p>

          <p>Representative Buddy Carter of Georgia has become the first Republican to announce his candidacy for the Senate seat currently held by Democrat Jon Ossoff, considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators. Carter's announcement follows Governor Brian Kemp's decision not to run, opening the door for other Republicans, including potentially Marjorie Taylor Greene. Carter's campaign is expected to focus on his support for President Trump and cultural issues such as transgender rights, contrasting himself with Ossoff. Ossoff's campaign stated he will defeat any challenger, viewing the Republican primary as a scramble for Trump's endorsement.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade framework with the United Kingdom, the first since pausing some "Liberation Day" tariffs, adjusting tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles. In return, the U.K. will ease trade barriers on products like ethanol, beef, and machinery, totaling $5 billion in trade, and will fast-track U.S. imports through customs. The agreement also includes a $10 billion purchase of Boeing airplane parts and a "secure supply chain" for pharmaceuticals. While some details are pending, both Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer touted the deal, with Starmer noting that some details still need to be "ironed out.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a notable upswing on Thursday following President Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all showing gains. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers. While the 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports will remain, the deal includes provisions for British automakers. Despite this positive development, analysts caution that market volatility is expected to continue, especially with ongoing trade negotiations with larger partners like China, where significant hurdles remain.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with leaders from both countries, emphasizing the need for immediate de-escalation after India struck sites in Pakistani territory in retaliation for a terrorist attack. Both countries claim they are not seeking escalation, but continue to accuse each other of aggression, including drone strikes and missile attacks.

          <p>Graham Parsons, a philosophy professor at West Point, resigned after 13 years, citing the academy's shift away from core educational principles due to the Trump administration's influence. Parsons stated that West Point began censoring its curriculum to align with the administration‚Äôs ideological preferences, following an executive order prohibiting instruction on so-called ‚Äúun-American‚Äù theories. This led to the removal of courses dealing with race, gender, and power dynamics, as well as influential authors from syllabi.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt collectors can refuse payment under certain conditions, such as when a partial payment is offered, when settling the debt, when legal action has been escalated, or when there are issues with the payment source. If a debt collector refuses payment, the debt remains active, accrues interest and fees, and may result in legal action if left unresolved. To get rid of collection debt quickly, one can negotiate smarter, work with a debt relief expert, consider a debt management plan, or consider bankruptcy. It's important to document all attempted payments and communication with the debt collector.</p>

          <p>Toyota has announced that President Trump's tariffs are projected to cost the automaker $1.3 billion over two months, highlighting the levies' impact on profits during a press briefing. The company has stopped short of predicting future impacts but stated it would take appropriate action at the appropriate timing. General Motors and Ford have also lowered their profit forecasts and indicated they would raise prices on certain car models due to the tariffs. Industry analysts predict that these import duties will lead to price hikes for consumers, potentially increasing car prices by $2,000 to $12,000.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signaled a possible reduction in tariffs on China, stating that the levies "can only come down" as he unveiled a trade deal with the UK. This announcement precedes the first talks between the U.S. and China since Trump imposed sweeping tariffs, initiating a global trade war. During a press conference, Trump expressed a willingness to lower tariffs if talks "go well," describing a potential "very good relationship" with China. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such deal since the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on UK imports, adjusts tariffs on UK autos, and aims to create a $5 billion opportunity for new exports for U.S. farmers and ranchers. While the White House called the agreement a "milestone," some experts downplayed its impact, noting that the U.S. may not be able to easily replicate the deal with other nations where America has a large trade deficit.</p>

          <p>Economists are revising their forecasts for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, citing President Trump's tariffs as raising the risk of higher inflation and slower economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need to wait and see how Trump's policies affect the economy before making any decisions on interest rates. Economists are increasingly predicting that the Fed will restart interest rate cuts in September or later, potentially requiring more aggressive cuts to support the economy. The Fed's current focus is on inflation, which has been above the central bank‚Äôs 2 percent target for four years.</p>
