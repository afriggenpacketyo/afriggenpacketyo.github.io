          <p>During President Trump's state visit to the UK, activists projected an image of him with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle. The projection also included Trump's Georgia mugshot, leading to the arrest of four individuals on suspicion of malicious communications. The incident highlights ongoing controversies surrounding Trump's past associations as he engages in diplomatic events with the British royal family. Thames Valley Police are conducting a thorough investigation into the unauthorized stunt.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-expected contraction in August, falling 0.1% year-on-year, marking the fourth straight month of decline but an improvement from July's 2.6% drop. This figure was better than the 1.9% contraction economists had anticipated. Imports also contracted by 5.2%, while exports to the United States saw a significant 13.8% drop despite a recent trade deal. The data comes just ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision, where it is expected to maintain current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

This pricing falls at the midpoint of the company's expected range as it prepares to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." After being reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, the company's public debut follows several delays and comes amid a recovering IPO market. The company reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue but also a wider net loss compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A candlelight vigil held at Arizona State University honored the legacy of conservative leader Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. Attendees and speakers, including close friends and colleagues from Turning Point USA, used the event to encourage political activism and voter registration in his memory. Many participants wore "I am Charlie" t-shirts and MAGA hats, with speakers framing future elections in the context of Kirk's influence. The gathering aimed to channel the tragedy into a renewed push for the conservative movement, particularly among young people.</p>

          <p>A new study from Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab reports that Russia is subjecting thousands of abducted Ukrainian children to "forced militarization" and "reeducation" at a minimum of 210 facilities. The research indicates that children are indoctrinated with pro-Russian narratives and, in some cases, are involved in combat training and the production of military equipment. This systematic effort to erase Ukrainian identity has been labeled a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian officials continue to advocate for the return of over 19,500 abducted children.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the two state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. While Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder and weapons offenses, the judge ruled the evidence was legally insufficient to support the terrorism counts. The court determined that the targeted killing did not demonstrate an intent to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence. Mangione, who also faces separate federal charges, has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports that the 16-year-old responsible for the recent shooting at a Colorado high school was an active user on a "violent gore" website known for extremist content.

The teen, Desmond Holly, had been "radicalized by an extremist network" according to officials and showed admiration for past mass killers on his social media accounts.

The central bank faces political pressure from the White House to lower borrowing costs, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that decisions are based on economic data.

          <p>Following his death, Robert Redford is remembered not just as a Hollywood star with classic good looks but as an actor who deliberately pursued complex and challenging roles. He frequently rejected simple, heroic parts to explore flawed and morally ambiguous characters in films like "The Candidate" and "Three Days of the Condor." This appreciation highlights how Redford used his all-American image as a "Trojan horse" to critique American ideals and expose societal rot. His career, both as an actor and a director, was defined by a commitment to giving audiences thought-provoking stories rather than easy entertainment.</p>

Under a recent plea agreement with the current developers, who faced criminal charges for attempting to restart construction illegally, the homes must be torn down by August 2026.

The piece contends that Kirk himself embraced abrasive and controversial rhetoric, and his success was tied to the very free speech principles his allies now seem willing to abandon.

          <p>Evidence presented by Utah prosecutors indicates that Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, may have been motivated by Kirk's anti-transgender rhetoric. In text messages, Robinson allegedly told his partner, who is transitioning, that he had enough of Kirk's "hatred." The shooting occurred just after Kirk made comments about transgender individuals and mass shootings. Robinson's mother reportedly told investigators her son had become more politically left-leaning and "pro-gay and trans rights oriented," leading to political disagreements with his family, who are registered Republicans.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, in the U.S. temporarily to help build an electric car battery plant, were detained in a large-scale immigration raid in Georgia. Several engineers described being handcuffed, shackled, and treated like criminals by armed agents, despite believing their visas were in order. The workers were held in a detention center where they faced freezing conditions and unsanitary water. The incident has strained relations between the U.S. and South Korea, with Seoul investigating potential human rights violations and a U.S. official expressing "deep regrets."</p>

Bettman acknowledged that past participation had challenges, but the decision to return was driven by the players' strong desire to represent their countries in a best-on-best international tournament.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), believes it is unlikely that major sports teams or ownership groups will go public. Speaking at a conference, he explained that sports assets have consistently been valued more highly in private markets than in public ones. Harris argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which public markets, with their short-term earnings focus, may not embrace. He noted that leagues are instead opening up to private equity investment for minority stakes, which better aligns with the long-term nature of team ownership. (not investment advice)</p>
