          <p>Various environmental groups, some with alleged ties to foreign entities and wealthy donors, are lobbying Democratic leaders to reject any proposals shielding fossil fuel companies from climate-related legal and legislative actions.  The groups' motivations and funding sources are under scrutiny, with accusations of foreign influence and potential conflicts of interest.

          <p>A study suggests that Fijian iguanas arrived via a transoceanic raft journey from North America, representing the longest known land vertebrate migration across the Pacific Ocean.  This challenges previous theories of gradual island-hopping, supported by genomic data showing a close relationship between Fijian and North American desert iguanas.  The study highlights the remarkable adaptability and resilience of these reptiles.</p>

          <p>Over 21% of UK working-age adults are not employed and not actively seeking work, according to recent figures.  While this rate has decreased slightly, it remains a significant challenge as the government seeks to boost economic growth.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has revised its economic forecast, predicting slower growth (below 2%) and higher inflation (2.8%) for 2025. This suggests a potential stagflation scenario, partly attributed to the impact of President Trump's tariffs.
