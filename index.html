          <h2>Trump Pushes for Ukraine Peace Deal Amidst Russian Aggression</h2>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Russia and Ukraine to end their conflict, even at the cost of territorial concessions, nearing his 100th day. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow for talks with Putin, while Trump expresses frustration over stalled peace efforts and recent Russian strikes on Kyiv. The proposed framework involves U.S. recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, lifting sanctions, and Ukraine renouncing NATO ambitions, in exchange for security guarantees and aid. However, Ukraine's leadership has consistently opposed territorial concessions, setting the stage for a difficult negotiation. Optimism around the peace deal is shaky due to the ongoing attacks and the firm stance of Ukrainian leadership.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering a law change that would allow cyclists who cause death through dangerous cycling to face life imprisonment, aligning cycling offenses with those of driving. The current maximum sentence is two years under an 1861 law, and the proposed changes also include harsher penalties for serious injury caused by dangerous or careless cycling. The Department for Transport stated that the updated legislation would ensure that those who recklessly endanger others face the full force of the law, prioritizing road safety.</p>

          <p>A mother suffering from paranoid schizophrenia has been given an indefinite hospital order for the manslaughter of her six-year-old son, as well as the attempted murder of her father. The court heard that Karolina Zurawska killed her son during a psychotic episode, believing she was instructed by a demonic force. The judge acknowledged the tragic nature of the event and recognized that her mental state greatly impacted her ability to understand her actions. The hospital order reflects the understanding that she may never be released due to her mental condition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expediting permit approvals for oil, mining, and fossil fuel projects on public lands, reducing the review process to a maximum of 28 days. This move, justified as a response to a national energy emergency, allows for the expansion of oil and gas projects. Environmental advocates criticize the decision, citing potential adverse environmental impacts and reduced community input. Legal challenges are expected due to concerns over environmental review processes and endangered species protection.</p>

The Black Feminist Fund is launching a new round of funding to support Black feminist activism worldwide, urging others to contribute and take courage from those fighting fascism.</p>

          <p>Apparel and textile business leaders are expressing concern that Trump's tariffs will negatively impact American jobs and consumers. The tariffs, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, are instead expected to raise prices and potentially lead to business failures. Industry representatives argue that the tariffs on both finished goods and essential supplies will hurt manufacturers and consumers alike. Concerns are also raised about the lack of vocational training and potential immigration restrictions hindering the domestic apparel sector's growth.</p>
