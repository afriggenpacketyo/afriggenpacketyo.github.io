          <p>BÃ¤rbel Bas, who comes from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), signaling a potential shift for the ailing party. Elected with 95% of the vote, she belongs to the party's left wing and is seen as a counterweight to her more conservative co-chair, Lars Klingbeil. As the new labor minister, Bas faces the immense tasks of reforming unemployment benefits and the pension system while rejecting cuts to social benefits, a stance that has been celebrated within her party.</p>

Developed rapidly and without a public process, the tool is intended to prevent noncitizen voting but has raised significant privacy and accuracy concerns among legal experts and some election officials. Critics worry about potential misuse of the centralized data and the reliability of matching disparate datasets, especially given the high stakes of questioning a person's citizenship.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. by a clear unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the early rounds, as ChÃ¡vez Jr. appeared hesitant and threw few punches, much to the visible frustration of his legendary father at ringside. Despite being booed by the crowd, Paul claimed an easy victory, bringing his professional record to 12-1 and fueling further debate about his place in the sport.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf has intensified concerns about the safety of women with public online profiles in Pakistan. The article details how online visibility for women often leads to harassment, privacy violations, and real-world violence, rooted in the country's patriarchal social norms. Many women who use social media for self-expression or professional reasons report receiving death and sexual assault threats, and express frustration with the slow response from both social media platforms and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Six years after 19-year-old college student Blaze Bernstein was murdered, his killer, former classmate Samuel Woodward, has been found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement.
