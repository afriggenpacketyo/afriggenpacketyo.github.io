        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU is considering new laws to standardize carry-on baggage sizing for EU airlines, prompted by widespread passenger confusion and inconsistent baggage rules among budget airlines. Proposed rules would guarantee one free personal item of specific dimensions, including wheels and handles, that can fit under a plane seat. The move comes after numerous complaints about unexpected fees for bags deemed too large, leading to calls for fairer and more consistent regulations. While some airlines argue that baggage policies keep fares low, consumer groups believe the proposals don't go far enough and legitimize charging for reasonably sized hand luggage. The goal is to reduce disputes and provide clarity for passengers traveling to and from EU destinations. </p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing 'poo pills,' containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, as a novel approach to eliminate antibiotic-resistant superbug infections. The pills aim to replace harmful gut bacteria with a healthy mix, potentially flushing out superbugs that resist antibiotics. Early data suggests this method can effectively clear superbugs from the bowel, reducing the risk of infections spreading elsewhere in the body. This research offers a promising alternative to traditional antibiotic treatments, addressing the growing concern of antibiotic resistance. The trial results indicate a positive shift in understanding the role of bacteria in overall health. </p>
