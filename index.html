          <p>A drive-by mass shooting outside a Chicago nightclub has resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. The incident occurred as people were leaving an album release party for a local rapper, and police believe the attack was targeted, though the assailants fired indiscriminately into the crowd. Authorities are investigating the event, which involved at least three shooters using multiple types of firearms, while the community grapples with the violence. No arrests have been made, and the venue has been temporarily closed by the city as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, a suspended Labour MP, has announced her resignation from the party to establish a new political entity alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was suspended for opposing the two-child benefit cap, cited the current government's policies on Gaza, welfare, and the cost of living as catalysts for her decision. She aims to challenge what she describes as a broken political system, stating the new party will unite independent MPs and activists. The Labour Party responded by highlighting its achievements in government, asserting it is the only party capable of delivering necessary change.</p>

          <p>Following the House's narrow passage of President Trump's major spending bill, criticism has emerged from both sides of the aisle. Former President Joe Biden condemned the legislation as cruel, highlighting its cuts to Medicaid and food assistance while providing tax breaks to the wealthy. Concurrently, two Republican representatives, Thomas Massie and Brian Fitzpatrick, voted against the bill, with Fitzpatrick citing unfavorable changes made by the Senate as his reason. The White House has announced that President Trump will sign the bill into law in a ceremony on the Fourth of July.</p>

          <p>This opinion article champions the passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill," arguing it provides substantial relief to middle-class and working Americans. The author contends that making tax cuts permanent, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, and expanding the child tax credit are tangible victories for families and hourly workers. The piece frames the legislation as a promise kept by Republicans who overcame partisan gridlock to deliver meaningful economic support. It suggests these accomplishments will provide a strong message for lawmakers to present to their constituents ahead of upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has issued a sharp rebuke to the MI5 domestic intelligence agency for misleading courts about an informant accused of severe domestic abuse. The ruling highlighted the agency's failure to be transparent, even after its director apologized for providing false evidence. The case involves a woman who alleges her former partner, an MI5 informant, boasted of immunity from prosecution, which empowered his abusive behavior. This incident has intensified scrutiny of MI5's accountability and its long-standing policy of secrecy, raising questions about the balance between national security and individual rights.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' expectations. This job growth contributed to a decrease in the national unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1 percent. While government and healthcare sectors saw significant gains, the report comes amid economic uncertainty due to trade policies and substantial federal job cuts. Experts suggest this strong performance may lead the Federal Reserve to delay interest rate cuts until later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed spending bill introduces several significant tax changes, but four key provisions are set to expire in 2028. These temporary measures include federal income tax deductions for workers' tips and overtime pay, capped at certain income levels. Additionally, the bill allows for a deduction on interest paid for new U.S.-assembled auto loans and establishes new government-seeded savings accounts for children born between 2025 and 2028. While these tax breaks offer short-term relief, their temporary nature means they are not permanent alterations to the U.S. tax code.</p>

Furthermore, toxicology reports found a wildlife tranquilizer compound in her bone marrow, a substance Barry Morphew had access to and admitted to using.

          <p>President Trump held a nearly hour-long phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a conversation that occurred shortly after the White House confirmed a halt on some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine. The pause in military aid was attributed to concerns over dwindling U.S. stockpiles. According to the Kremlin, the two leaders discussed the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, and the recent passage of Trump's major legislative bill in Congress. This development comes amid ongoing tensions and Trump's expressed frustration with the lack of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>A new independent study estimates that over 80,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between October 2023 and January 2025, a figure substantially higher than official counts from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Researchers, collaborating with a Palestinian survey group, interviewed households directly to gather data, finding that violent deaths were about 40% higher than reported. The study also tallied over 8,500 indirect deaths from causes like starvation and disease. While not yet peer-reviewed, the findings suggest that official figures are a conservative minimum rather than an exaggeration of the conflict's true toll.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology for broadcasting a controversial performance by the rap-punk group Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury festival. During their set, the band, known for its criticism of the war in Gaza, led the audience in a chant of "Death to the IDF." The BBC's director-general expressed deep regret for the broadcast of what he termed "offensive and deplorable behavior." In response to the backlash, which included a police investigation and the band's U.S. visas being revoked, the BBC has announced new policies for future festival coverage, including avoiding live broadcasts of "high risk" acts.</p>

          <p>A recent diplomatic crisis, sparked by a violent police raid on ethnic Azeris in Russia, has severely strained relations between Moscow and Baku, suggesting a potential realignment of alliances in the Caucasus. Azerbaijan responded to the incident with strong condemnation, canceling cultural events and arresting Russian journalists, while Russia has downplayed the situation. Analysts believe this escalation reflects deeper issues, including Azerbaijan's growing military and energy independence and President Aliyev's annoyance with Moscow's handling of a previous plane crash. This friction threatens bilateral projects and indicates Russia's waning influence in the region.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece, written by former diplomats, warns against a plan by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to effectively dismantle the State Department's human rights and global justice bureaus. The authors argue that gutting the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) by laying off most of its expert staff will cripple America's ability to promote democracy and protect human rights abroad. They contend this move undermines decades of bipartisan foreign policy, endangers critical programs, and sends a dangerous message that the U.S. no longer prioritizes these core values, potentially destabilizing global affairs.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump is leveraging his political power to pressure large tech and media companies into settling lawsuits he filed against them. After Meta and X (formerly Twitter) made multi-million dollar payments to settle cases related to his 2021 account suspensions, discussions have now begun with Google's parent company, Alphabet. Critics argue this represents a hypocritical use of presidential power, as Trump sues companies for allegedly caving to political pressure while simultaneously applying his own.

Furthermore, its deep cuts to Medicaid are expected to cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, providing Democrats with a powerful line of attack.

          <p>President Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill" significantly reshapes U.S. energy policy by eliminating long-standing federal support for the solar and wind industries while promoting fossil fuels.

Conversely, the legislation opens more federal lands to oil, gas, and coal extraction and slashes royalty payments for producers.
