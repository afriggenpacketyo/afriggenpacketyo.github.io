          <p>This article reviews various UK newspaper headlines, covering diverse national and international news. Major focus is given to US President Donald Trump's "tirade" at the UN regarding illegal migration and his criticism of NATO. Domestically, headlines detail a deepening "crisis" around Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff over leaked emails and donation handling. The article also highlights criticism from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, which labels the UK as "probably the worst country in Europe" for drug prices, threatening investment. Finally, it notes the death of cricket umpire Dickie Bird at 92, celebrated as a "national treasure."</p>

          <p>London Stansted Airport experienced significant operational delays after a small fire erupted in its Escape Lounge around 03:30 BST, producing a substantial amount of smoke. This incident led to a temporary halt in passenger entry to security, causing considerable disruption for early morning travelers at the Essex hub. Fortunately, the airport fire service swiftly brought the blaze under control, and officials confirmed there were no reports of any injuries to passengers. Although security operations resumed by 06:00, the article cautioned that ongoing delays were possible and strongly advised passengers to verify their flight statuses before heading to the airport.</p>

The article chronicles her remarkable journey, from a prodigious talent who even worked as an Amazon delivery driver during the early pandemic, to her current status as a formidable athlete. Her mother battled alcoholism for years, and her father passed away from advanced lung cancer, deeply impacting Jones. Now a patron for an addiction charity, she transforms her profound loss into a powerful, unshakeable fearlessness that drives her exceptional play on the pitch.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered nearly £500 million lost to fraud over the past year, largely thanks to a new artificial intelligence tool. This significant sum, the largest ever reclaimed by government anti-fraud teams in a single year, includes £186 million related to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, developed by the Cabinet Office, identifies policy weaknesses before exploitation and will now be licensed to other countries. While civil liberties campaigners have raised concerns about AI use, ministers emphasize the tool's role in protecting public funds and enabling investment in essential services.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks several inaccurate claims made by President Donald Trump regarding Tylenol, vaccines, and autism risks. Trump asserted links between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism, and between vaccines and autism in Amish children, contradicting medical evidence. The fact-check clarifies that studies do not show a direct causal link between Tylenol and autism, and while autism rates may appear lower in Amish communities, this is due to underreporting, not vaccination absence. The article also debunks his claims about the number and size of childhood vaccines and the safety of the Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, citing CDC and expert consensus.</p>

          <h2>Canadian Investigation Finds TikTok's Child Data Protection Inadequate</h2>

          <p>A Canadian investigation has concluded that TikTok's measures to prevent underage use and protect children's personal data are inadequate. Despite the app's 13-year-old age restriction, hundreds of thousands of Canadian children use it annually, leading to the collection of sensitive personal information for targeted marketing. The article highlights the findings of Canada's privacy commissioner, Philippe Dufresne, who noted the "vast" amount of data collected. TikTok, while disputing some findings, has agreed to implement enhanced measures to strengthen platform protections for Canadians, amid ongoing global scrutiny over its impact on users and national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Several US citizens and a green card holder have filed legal claims against the U.S. government, alleging wrongful detention, racial profiling, and mistreatment by federal immigration agents. The article highlights the case of Cary Lopez Alvarado, a US citizen detained while pregnant, who later gave birth in the hospital with injuries. Another defendant, Juan Rivas, claims he was beaten despite having legal documents. These cases underscore concerns that the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies put citizens at risk, prompting lawyers to advise carrying identification. The Department of Homeland Security is on pace to deport nearly 600,000 undocumented immigrants by 2025.</p>

          <p>Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has been ordered to repay nearly £5 million after falsely claiming it met safe maternity care standards, despite a damning regulator report. The money was received under a Maternity Incentive Scheme, which offers rebates for meeting safety measures. An investigation by NHS Resolution found the trust had not met the standards, leading to the repayment. The article highlights the "inadequate" rating of care and calls from families for an independent inquiry into the trust's services. This incident exposes systemic flaws in self-assessment schemes across the NHS, where other trusts have also had to repay funds.</p>

          <p>A Mexican national and former DACA recipient, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39, has tragically died in ICE custody after being transferred to a local hospital, marking the 14th detainee death since January. This incident coincides with the Trump administration's intensified mass deportation agenda, raising significant concerns among Democratic senators about the increasing number of deaths and alleged human rights violations in detention centers. The article highlights criticisms regarding inadequate medical care, overly restrictive segregation, and lax mental health services at facilities like Adelanto. While ICE asserts comprehensive medical care is provided, the circumstances surrounding Ayala-Uribe's death, following treatment for an abscess and other conditions, remain under investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded its recall of frozen shrimp products for the sixth time in over a month, due to potential contamination by Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. Seattle-based AquaStar is the latest company to voluntarily pull three types of shrimp from grocery stores across 31 states, affecting nearly 85,000 bags. While no illnesses have been reported, the article notes the affected products may have been prepared or held in unsanitary conditions, prompting advice for consumers to discard or return them. The ongoing investigation began with the detection of Cesium-137 in imported shrimp from Indonesia, with experts indicating that such frequent recalls for radioactive contamination are highly unusual.</p>
