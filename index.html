          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 22:10:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified additional documents related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, claiming they show Obama administration officials "manufactured" intelligence. Democrats and some intelligence officials have strongly disputed this characterization, accusing Gabbard of misrepresenting the findings and risking sensitive sources and methods. The released material, a 2017 House GOP report, does not fundamentally alter the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia sought to influence the election. The move has prompted significant concern from figures like Senator Mark Warner about damaging trust with international intelligence partners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The administration had argued the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from historical legal principles. While the White House plans to appeal, this ruling, along with others, currently prevents the policy from taking effect.</p>

          <p>This article explores the origins of the band Black Sabbath, detailing how they created the genre of heavy metal as a reaction against the "hippy" music of the late 1960s. It chronicles their evolution from a blues band into a darker, heavier act, inspired by horror films and the industrial environment of Birmingham. A key element in their unique sound was guitarist Tony Iommi's innovative playing style, which he developed after a factory accident severed the tips of two fingers. The piece highlights the band's influential albums and their lasting legacy, cementing Ozzy Osbourne as an iconic figure in rock history.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' recent acquisition Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position. This contrasts with his previous insistence on being a designated hitter while with the Boston Red Sox. Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him more engaged in the game and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The change comes after a tense spring where his role was debated, and he had previously rejected the idea of playing first base for the Red Sox before being traded to the Giants.</p>

While the league itself will not take a political stance, Garber stated that individual teams are permitted to make their own statements. The policy has been criticized by some fan groups who feel the current political climate makes them feel unsafe and that the ban stifles their expression.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a House resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest over the next 30 years. The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, aims to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. Proponents of the resolution criticize the culling as inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, estimating the cost at over $1.3 billion.

The reports emerged as the administration faces pressure to release more information about the case, a promise Trump made during his campaign. This development coincides with a federal judge in Florida denying the DOJ's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein's 2006 case, citing secrecy rules.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the first, narrowly avoiding a technical recession. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. However, analysts express caution, noting that future growth may be challenged by softening global trade and potential U.S. tariffs. While domestic consumption also saw a modest increase, economists suggest the current pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained through the rest of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Market conditions vary significantly by location, with cities like Austin having more inventory, while areas like suburban New York remain highly competitive for buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored a crucial extra-time winner against Germany to send her team to the Euro 2025 final against England. Her heroic goal completes a remarkable personal journey, as she was hospitalized with viral meningitis just days before the tournament began. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner was used sparingly in the early games but returned to top form when it mattered most. Her skillful goal in the semi-final broke a tense deadlock and highlighted why she is considered one of the world's best players, turning a potential tournament absence into a moment of triumph.</p>

          <p>Officials are warning that insurance claims from the destructive Eaton wildfire in Los Angeles could completely deplete California's $21 billion wildfire fund. The fund was created to protect utility customers if a blaze is caused by a power company's equipment, which is a leading theory for the Eaton fire's origin. With insured loss estimates for the fire ranging from $15 billion to potentially much higher, the state's Catastrophe Response Council has stated the fund's financial health is under strain. The council is now exploring strategies to ensure the fund's durability amid concerns about substantial payouts and legal fees.</p>

CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the company could face a "few rough quarters" due to factors like expiring EV tax credits and tariff impacts. In its report, Tesla mentioned it has started initial builds of a more affordable vehicle, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025, a move to address increasing competition.

Medical charities report that patient numbers for sexual abuse have nearly tripled, with survivors recounting horrific attacks.

On the positive side, he pointed to a less severe than expected trade deal with Japan and a generally strong earnings season so far. However, he also warned of negative forces, including speculative "froth" in certain stocks reminiscent of past market bubbles and potential inflationary pressures that could deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates.

          <p>Vehicle production in the United Kingdom during the first half of the year has dropped to its lowest point in over 70 years, when excluding the COVID-19 pandemic period. Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) shows a 7.3% fall in car output and a 45% decline in van production. The slump is attributed partly to uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production, and the closure of a major van plant. Despite a rise in electric vehicle manufacturing, the industry does not expect to return to pre-slump production levels by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A historical sign at Muir Woods National Monument has been changed, becoming the first known alteration following a presidential executive order to remove "unpatriotic" language from federal sites. In 2021, park staff had updated a timeline to include more complex historical details, such as the role of Indigenous peoples and the racist views of some historical figures involved in the park's creation. The overlay containing this additional context has now been removed, reverting the sign to its original, less complete version. Critics, including a former park ranger involved in the project, have condemned the move as censorship of American history.</p>
