          <p>As the Catholic Church prepares to select Pope Francisâ€™ successor, several key questions arise regarding the process. The conclave's duration is uncertain, depending on how long it takes the eligible cardinals to agree on a pick, requiring two-thirds of the votes. Cardinals are sequestered without access to communication with the outside world and spend time between votes in prayer and discussion. Potential frontrunners include Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, Luis Antonio Tagle, and Cardinal Peter Erdo. The election is also a referendum on Pope Francisâ€™ papacy, with different factions seeking a leader who either prioritizes tradition or continues Francis' progressive approach.</p>

          <p>A growing cottage industry of right-wing intellectuals argues that American culture and society have become fundamentally hostile to people like them, and see the right's embrace of Trumpian authoritarianism as a defensive response against a near-omnipotent cultural left. This is fueled by a sense of persecution in liberal-dominated fields like journalism and academia, leading to the creation of internally homogenous spaces. Key figures like Patrick Deneen and Michael Anton believe America is being corrupted by left-wing rot, influencing policy in areas from immigration to education. Their ideas, shaped by experiences within left-wing professions and radicalized in alternative spaces, are now shaping policy in the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending a newly-agreed trade deal with India, specifically an exemption on National Insurance contributions (Nics) extended from one to three years for short-term visa holders. Opposition parties claim this could disadvantage British workers, as Indian workers may be cheaper to employ. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds argues that the deal will not impact British workers, as the UK has 16 agreements preventing double taxation of work. The deal aims to boost trade between the two countries by Â£25.5bn a year by 2040, benefiting UK firms exporting goods like whisky and cars to India.</p>

          <p>Container bookings from China to the United States experienced a significant decline, plunging 27% year-on-year to their lowest level since February, reflecting the impact of increased US tariffs. This drop signals deep disruption and sourcing shifts, as shippers rushed to move products in the first quarter before sharply pulling back due to new tariff policies. The sharpest weekly drop this year was observed, with volume decreasing by 42.7% from the previous week. Continuing uncertainty over future tariff levels prompts supply chain teams to rethink timing, inventory levels, and sourcing strategies.</p>

          <p>While AI models are increasingly used for forecasting, they still struggle to outperform top human forecasters. Evidence from Metaculus tournaments shows that human superforecasters consistently beat machines, although the gap is narrowing. The best model in Q1 this year was a simple one that pulled recent news articles and asked an OpenAI model to make predictions. Limitations include poor quantitative thinking and logical reasoning skills, as well as poor web research skills. Despite these limitations, AIs could eventually surpass humans due to their ability to learn from mistakes and avoid biases.</p>

The projects aimed to study the accumulation of metals in the stratosphere from spacecraft, which some fear could damage the ozone layer. Critics argue that the administration is prioritizing a donor and political ally over environmental concerns.

          <p>Footage showing an Egyptian military officer in a Chinese J-10 fighter jet during a joint exercise has fueled speculation about a potential arms sale. The Eagles of Civilisation 2025 exercise, the first joint air training between China and Egypt, is seen as an indicator of possible Chinese jet sales to Egypt. China's close ally Pakistan bought a batch of J-10C jets in 2021. A deal with Egypt could expand Beijing's arms exports to a key US ally, and reshape the regional geopolitical landscape. A Chinese military analyst said the move signalled mutual trust and friendship between the two militaries.</p>
