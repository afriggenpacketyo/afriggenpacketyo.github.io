          <p>The FBI and Utah authorities are intensifying their search for the person who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk, releasing new images of an individual of interest. Investigators have recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to be the weapon used in the targeted attack at Utah Valley University. A reward of up to $100,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest, as political figures, including President Trump, react to the killing which they have linked to heated political rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The court ruled he orchestrated a plot to remain in power following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict, which also bars him from public office until 2033, has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, escalating diplomatic tensions between the nations.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, serves as a crucial remedy for the current weaknesses in the global multilateral system. The author contends that as institutions like the United Nations are increasingly sidelined, the SCO offers a platform for cooperation among diverse nations, challenging the unilateralism and trade wars promoted by some Western states. The piece suggests the SCO model is vital for preventing further global fragmentation and promoting a more inclusive international order.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, commenced with an unusual opening statement from the defendant, who is representing himself. Routh's philosophical musings led to multiple interruptions from the judge, who accused him of making a mockery of the court. Prosecutors laid out their case, detailing how Routh was discovered with a rifle at Trump's golf course, with testimony from a Secret Service agent and an eyewitness who followed the suspect after he fled.</p>

A recent survey of primary school teachers indicates that many are spending significant time addressing these developmental gaps, which they attribute partly to social isolation and increased screen time. This trend poses a challenge to the government's goal of improving school readiness levels for five-year-olds, with schools increasingly having to "pick up the pieces."</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting, security measures have been significantly tightened for President Trump and other political figures across the United States. President Trump's 9/11 commemoration speech was moved to a more secure location, and several lawmakers have postponed public events or vowed to start carrying firearms for personal protection. The heightened state of alert reflects growing anxiety over political violence, as the manhunt for Kirk's killer continues and anonymous threats have led to lockdowns at several universities.</p>

          <p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has dismissed Kevin Struthers, its senior director of music programming, who had been with the institution for 30 years. This firing is the latest in a series of staff departures since President Trump became the center's chair and appointed Richard Grennell as its new president. The move raises concerns about the future of jazz programming at the prestigious venue, as the former artistic director for jazz, Jason Moran, also departed recently.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully voted to change chamber rules to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's executive branch nominees. The new procedure allows for non-cabinet level nominees to be confirmed in batches rather than through individual votes, a move aimed at overcoming what Republicans describe as Democratic obstruction. This "nuclear option" applies to sub-Cabinet, ambassador, and other executive positions but excludes judicial nominees, significantly altering the power dynamics of the confirmation process in a GOP-controlled government.</p>

His comments come as Spirit recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year, facing weak demand and high costs while larger rivals successfully compete with their own basic economy fares.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in Maine are issuing warnings about the northward spread of the invasive hammerhead worm, a pest originally from Asia. These worms are destructive because they prey on essential earthworms and have few natural predators, allowing them to decimate local populations and impact native plant growth. The public is being advised not to squish or cut the worms, as this causes them to multiply; instead, they should be captured and either frozen or drowned in soapy water, with sightings reported to citizen science platforms.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a Hamas office in Doha, Qatar, has shaken the long-standing security arrangements between the U.S. and its Persian Gulf allies. The attack, which killed several people, has angered Qatari officials, who host a major U.S. airbase and had allowed Hamas a presence in their capital at Washington's request. The incident has led other Gulf states to question the reliability of the U.S. security umbrella, as the strike was carried out by a key U.S. ally seemingly without consequence, undermining trust in American protection.</p>
