          <p>Yokohama F Marinos were eliminated from the Asian Champions League Elite after a 4-1 loss to Al Nassr, a Saudi Arabian football club. Jhon Duran scored twice, while Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane each added a goal for Al Nassr.

          <p>Despite the recent market rebound, some Wall Street analysts remain cautious due to concerns about the economic impact of the trade war. Michael Mullaney of Boston Partners is focused on economic data showing potential damage from tariffs, such as declining shipping volumes and reduced consumer spending. He is holding cash, skeptical that the trade situation will be resolved quickly, and is worried about the entrenched fallout from trade hostilities. This cautious stance contrasts with the broader market's relief over signals of easing trade tensions from the White House.</p>
