          <p>A BBC report highlights the dire situation of Siwar Ashour, a five-month-old baby in Gaza suffering from malnutrition due to an Israeli blockade that restricts aid. The baby requires a special milk formula due to allergies, which is scarce under current conditions. The report describes the devastated environment where Siwar lives with her mother and grandmother, facing shortages of food, clean water, and essential supplies. The mother reports that the baby is easily startled by the sounds of war, which have been a constant presence since her birth, and that she and her mother are struggling to find food to eat themselves.</p>

          <p>A West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest over the Trump administration's changes to the academy, particularly the end of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Parsons objected to Trump wearing his Make America Great Again hat during the commencement address, viewing it as a blurring of the lines between the presidency and personal politics. He stated that West Point began eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology, which he saw as indoctrination rather than education. Parsons felt professionally betrayed, unable to pursue important questions within his discipline due to the administration's interference.</p>

          <p>A news analysis suggests that the Trump family has monetized the presidency more than any other administration, normalizing activities that would have previously triggered scrutiny and investigations. The Trump family and their business partners have reportedly collected millions through ventures such as a new cryptocurrency and overseas real estate deals. Qatar's donation of a luxury jet for Mr. Trump's use has also raised ethical concerns. Critics argue that the administration has dismantled accountability measures, leading to a lack of official investigations into these activities, but that public outrage may eventually catch up with him.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County sheriff‚Äôs deputy, Jim Devoe, was arrested on suspicion of felony domestic violence, two years after being arrested and charged with physically abusing his 5-year-old son. Devoe had been on leave since January 2023 and was arrested in Lancaster. The sheriff‚Äôs department has launched criminal and internal administrative investigations into Devoe, who worked as a bailiff at the Antelope Valley Courthouse in Lancaster. Devoe pleaded not guilty to a felony count of child abuse in June 2023, and his lawyer anticipates a favorable resolution with the District Attorney, expecting both felony charges to be dismissed with a plea to a single misdemeanor count.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson stated that there is enough resistance among GOP senators to halt President Trump's budget bill unless significant changes are made. Johnson criticized the bill for increasing the deficit and not adequately cutting spending. Another issue is that the bill raises the debt ceiling, which some senators want to address separately. Senator Rand Paul also voiced opposition, stating he would not vote for the legislation unless the debt ceiling increase is stripped because he said it would "explode deficits."</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump swept the battleground states, the Democratic Party is still struggling to recover, with approval ratings at startling new lows. The party is grappling with the loss of support from communities they had long counted on, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos. The Democratic base is also aghast at the speed with which Trump is reversing progressive accomplishments, and at the lack of resistance from congressional leaders. Top party officials, activists, and donors are weighing how to rebuild, reassessing how to speak to voters, how to listen to them, and how to reach those who have tuned out entirely.</p>

          <p>A second major power outage in two days has hit southeastern France, this time in the city of Nice, after an electrical facility was damaged by suspected arson. The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, blamed "malicious acts," and a criminal investigation has been opened for "organized arson." The blackout left approximately 45,000 households without electricity, stopped the city's trams, and briefly cut power to Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport. Police have not yet determined whether this incident is linked to a similar power outage that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival the previous day.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, an expert has developed a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting." This approach focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs and creating a safe space for them to express their feelings. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without rushing to fix or dismiss them, and they respond without shaming their child. The expert teaches parents not just how to manage their children's behaviors, but also to help them build emotional resilience, trust and connection through open and honest conversations.</p>
