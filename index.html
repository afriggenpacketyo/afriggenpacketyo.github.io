          <h2>Snap Shares Tumble Following Lack of Revenue Guidance Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 16:48:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Snap's stock price plummeted 15% after the company released its first-quarter earnings report, which exceeded revenue expectations but failed to provide guidance for the upcoming quarter. Citing macroeconomic uncertainties and potential impacts on advertising demand, Snap's leadership expressed caution about future financial performance. Despite a 14% increase in sales to $1.36 billion and a rise in daily active users to 460 million, the absence of a revenue outlook spooked investors, reflecting broader concerns about the tech sector's vulnerability to economic headwinds and evolving trade policies. Snap lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses range to between $2.65 billion and $2.70 billion, down from $2.70 billion to $2.75 billion.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with ABC News, President Trump stood firm on his controversial trade policies, asserting that China would likely absorb the costs of tariffs and dismissing concerns about potential economic hardships for Americans. Despite polling data indicating widespread anxiety over his trade policies and their potential impact on inflation and recession risks, Trump maintained an optimistic outlook, claiming that gasoline and grocery prices had decreased since he took office. He defended his imposition of tariffs on China, arguing that the country had been taking advantage of the United States for too long. The interview highlighted the ongoing debate over the economic consequences of Trump's trade agenda, with economists expressing concern about potential price increases for consumers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration had recently implemented, responding to lobbying efforts from automakers and policy groups concerned about regulatory uncertainty and additional costs. The easing of tariffs aims to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports, which had resulted from separate levies stacking on top of one another. Automakers expressed appreciation for the changes, but continue to face significant cost increases due to the levies. The move comes as the car industry grapples with regulatory uncertainty and additional costs due to the levies, with some companies discontinuing guidance and suspending stock buybacks in response.</p>

          <p>With household credit card debt reaching record highs, many cardholders are exploring debt relief options, including debt settlement programs. According to the American Fair Credit Council, debt relief companies successfully settle about 55% of accounts, with varying outcomes depending on the debt, creditors, and financial situation. To improve the chances of a successful debt settlement, individuals should understand how the process works, assess their financial situation, and be prepared to explain their hardship to creditors. While debt settlement isn't guaranteed, it can be a viable option for borrowers struggling to repay their debts by negotiating a lump-sum payment for less than the full balance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>As President Trump marks his first 100 days in office, various sources analyze the impacts of his policies on trade, immigration, and international relations. Tariffs are affecting global economies, with the UK facing potential export challenges and China possibly diverting goods. Trump's immigration policies are straining Canadian-American relations, with increased nationalism among Canadians and caution at the border. His handling of a hypothetical international crisis suggests a tendency to react quickly, potentially without full information, and to rely on executive power, reflecting a pattern seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. The analysis underscores the complex and evolving landscape under Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been instrumental in cutting government agencies and the federal workforce, sparking lawsuits and criticism. Despite promising significant cost savings, DOGE's actual cuts have fallen short, with questionable claims about the size of the government's fraud problem. Musk's aggressive tactics, including offering months of pay for resignations and scrutinizing federal employees, have drawn outrage from Democrats and raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest with his business ventures. DOGE's efforts have led to agency dismantlement, access to sensitive federal data, and clashes with Democrats and even some Trump allies, raising questions about the long-term effects of Musk's influence on the federal government.</p>

While UPS claims the reduction in Amazon volume was a strategic choice, Amazon indicates it offered to increase UPS' volumes, respecting their decision to reduce shipments.

          <p>Matt Petgrave, the hockey player arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the death of Adam Johnson, will not face charges, according to British prosecutors. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge Petgrave, whose skate inadvertently sliced Johnson's neck during a game in October 2023. The CPS cited the lack of a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offense following a thorough police investigation and comprehensive review of the evidence. The incident sparked debate about player protection on the ice, leading the English Ice Hockey Association to mandate neck protection for all players.</p>

          <p>The remedy phase of the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust case against Google has shifted its focus to artificial intelligence, with the DOJ arguing that Google could use its AI products to strengthen its monopoly in online search. The DOJ contends that Google's control of search helps improve its AI products, creating a cycle that maintains the company's dominance and blocks competitors from both marketplaces. The integration of search and Gemini, Google's AI chatbot, is a key area of concern, with the DOJ proposing remedies that address all ways users access Google search. Google rejects the argument that it could monopolize generative AI, citing healthy competition in the AI field and the success of companies like OpenAI and Meta.</p>

These findings come as Harvard faces scrutiny from the Trump administration over accusations of antisemitism and is fighting the withdrawal of federal funding, adding to the university's challenges.</p>

The public spat underscores the backlash the Trump administration faces over tariffs imposed on various countries, including China.
