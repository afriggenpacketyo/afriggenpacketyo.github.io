        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal watchdog, has launched an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith. The probe follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere in the 2024 election, potentially violating the Hatch Act. This act restricts partisan political activities by government employees. The OSC is separate from the Justice Department and cannot press criminal charges, but it can refer findings for further action, though Smith is no longer a government employee.</p>

          <p>Romania is increasingly acknowledging its role in the "porajmos," the genocide of Sinti and Roma people during World War II, a topic long silenced in the country. At a recent commemoration event, Romania's new pro-European president emphasized the need to grapple with this history and combat ongoing discrimination and hate speech. For decades, Romania's involvement, which included the deportation and murder of over 25,000 Roma, was not taught in schools or discussed publicly. The event signals a potential shift towards historical accountability and protecting minority rights.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychological technique known as "dopamine anchoring" is gaining traction as a method for boosting motivation for unpleasant tasks. The strategy involves repeatedly pairing an enjoyable stimulus, like music or a podcast, with a chore, such as cleaning or exercising. Over time, the brain begins to associate the task itself with the pleasure-inducing dopamine release, making it easier to start and complete. While experts confirm its basis in neuroscience, they caution against using unhealthy rewards or becoming overly reliant on external stimuli, advising it be used as a mindful training tool rather than a crutch.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, Ethereum has transformed from a niche project into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are leveraging its network for tokenized assets and funds, drawn by its stability and programmability. While co-founder Vitalik Buterin celebrates this mainstream adoption, he also warns against the risk of centralization if a few large players dominate the ecosystem. The platform's evolution from a cypherpunk ideal to Wall Street's plumbing highlights a major shift in digital finance.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man in Polk County, Tennessee, was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill public officials and law enforcement officers. During the arrest at his home, deputies discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device, prompting a broader investigation. A subsequent search by local authorities and the ATF uncovered 14 explosive devices. Investigators believe the man, Kevin Wade O'Neal, attempted to detonate the explosives as officers arrived to apprehend him. He now faces multiple charges, including nine counts of attempted first-degree murder against the responding officers.</p>

However, the Police Federation, which represents over 145,000 officers, criticized the award as insufficient, stating it "barely treads water" and won't address issues like low morale and high resignation rates. The pay award means a starting constable's salary will increase to £31,164.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused the Labour government of making "even bigger mistakes" than former Prime Minister Liz Truss with its fiscal policies. In an opinion piece, Badenoch warns that increased borrowing and spending without corresponding cuts are pushing the UK into a dangerous "debt spiral," drawing parallels to the market turmoil following Truss's 2022 mini-budget. She argues that despite criticizing the past, Labour has not learned the lessons on fiscal responsibility, putting the economy on a precarious footing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As wildfires become more frequent, health experts are offering guidance on how to mitigate the risks of smoke inhalation, which can degrade air quality hundreds of miles away. The EPA's Air Quality Index helps identify dangerous conditions, with levels above 150 considered unhealthy for everyone. To stay safe, it is recommended to remain indoors, close windows, and use air conditioners on a recirculation setting. If going outside is necessary, wearing a well-fitted N95 mask can filter out the majority of harmful airborne particles. Using an indoor air purifier can also significantly improve air quality inside a home.</p>

The poor data fueled speculation of a September interest rate cut but also prompted President Trump to publicly criticize the Federal Reserve and fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

          <p>England's women's rugby team secured a dominant 97-7 victory over Spain, scoring 15 tries in a one-sided affair. However, the win was overshadowed by a red card issued to England's captain, Marlie Packer, for a dangerous clearout. The dismissal means Packer may miss some of England's opening matches at the upcoming Rugby World Cup, pending a disciplinary review. The match served as a warm-up for the tournament, where the Red Roses are considered strong favorites, but the potential loss of their captain introduces a significant challenge for the team's campaign.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military announced it has successfully struck key infrastructure inside Russia, including a major oil refinery in Ryazan and a military airfield used for drone launches. The attacks are part of Kyiv's ongoing effort to disrupt Russia's war capabilities. In separate news, Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies said they have uncovered a significant graft scheme involving the procurement of military drones at inflated prices, leading to several arrests. Meanwhile, a fire near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Moscow blamed on Ukrainian shelling, has reportedly been controlled.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption bodies have exposed a major graft scheme related to the procurement of military drones and signal-jamming systems at inflated prices. According to investigators, officials and a sitting lawmaker allegedly accepted kickbacks of up to 30% of the contract value from supplier companies, resulting in four arrests. The announcement came just days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following public protests against a government move to curb their power. President Zelenskyy has affirmed a zero-tolerance policy for corruption and praised the agencies' work.</p>

          <p>A recent panel discussion on 'Washington Week With The Atlantic' explored the dynamic between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Panelists noted that while the Trump administration believes it has significant leverage over Israel, Netanyahu's own domestic political considerations limit the effectiveness of U.S. pressure. The conversation highlighted the complexities of the U.S.-Israel relationship, where strategic alliances intersect with the internal political survival of both leaders. The discussion also touched on Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics director.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to dismantle the historical and systemic barriers that have led to racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates in the U.S. Due to decades of segregation at public pools, generations of Black Americans had limited access to aquatic spaces, creating a cycle of fear and lack of swimming skills. Research shows Black children are significantly more likely to drown than their white peers. By providing accessible lessons and scholarships, these programs aim to improve water safety, create more Black swim instructors, and foster a new connection to water.</p>

          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in the growth of new utility-scale solar energy, adding over 3 gigawatts of capacity last year. This boom is not driven by rooftop panels but by large-scale projects from utilities like Florida Power & Light, which benefit from streamlined state regulations and favorable economics. With natural gas prices rising, solar has become a cheaper alternative for power generation. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid, which requires significant investment in storage and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is increasing its pressure on Israel to address the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, adopting a notably tougher diplomatic tone. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul made an urgent appeal for Israel to allow the United Nations to manage aid distribution, stating the "humanitarian catastrophe must be ended now." This shift comes as images of suffering in Gaza intensify international concern. While Germany remains a key ally of Israel, officials in Berlin are signaling that patience is wearing thin, though concrete actions like sanctions are considered unlikely due to historical context.</p>

The Wallabies, powered by standout players like Will Skelton, showed a dramatic improvement from their first-Test loss. While the Lions achieved their primary goal of winning the tour, the final loss left a "bittersweet" feeling, preventing the team from achieving the historic 3-0 whitewash they had aimed for.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter profit, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. The company's net earnings fell to $12.37 billion from over $30 billion a year ago. However, its operating earnings, which Buffett considers a more accurate measure of performance, were only down slightly to $11.16 billion, as most of its diverse businesses performed well. The writedown reflects ongoing challenges at Kraft Heinz, which is struggling with changing consumer tastes and is exploring a potential spinoff of some brands. (not investment advice)</p>

People with higher anxiety might benefit from private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts often gravitate toward solo exercises like running or yoga that can be done at home.</p>
