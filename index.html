            <p>China's economy demonstrated resilience in the first quarter, surpassing expectations with a 5.4% GDP growth, fueled by policy stimulus and innovation in sectors like AI. Retail sales and industrial output also showed strong growth, while the urban unemployment rate decreased. However, the National Statistics Bureau cautioned about increasing external complexities, including tariff threats from the U.S., and insufficient domestic demand, suggesting the need for more proactive macro policies to sustain economic recovery. This growth occurs as the US considers further tariffs on Chinese goods. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A new Texas bill, Senate Bill 6, could potentially hinder President Trump's "Stargate" AI initiative, which aims to establish ultra-powerful data centers across the country, primarily in Texas. The bill introduces a six-month regulatory review and additional requirements for data centers, raising costs and extending approval timelines, prompting concerns from Trump allies who fear it could drive businesses to other states. Despite the bill's sponsor claiming it supports Trump's agenda, critics argue it could jeopardize America's competitiveness in the global AI race, particularly against China.</p>

            <p>Wildlife rehabilitation centers in Southern California are overwhelmed with sick and starving brown pelicans, with experts linking the crisis to a toxic algae bloom. Hundreds of adult pelicans have been poisoned by domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the bloom, while an influx of malnourished baby pelicans is also being observed. Officials theorize that the illness and death of adult pelicans are leaving the chicks to fend for themselves prematurely. Rescue centers are struggling to keep up with the number of birds requiring intensive care.</p>

            <p>Nvidia projects a $5.5 billion impact due to tightened U.S. export regulations on chip sales to China, amid an escalating trade war between the two nations. The company will now require licenses to export its H20 AI chip, a popular product in China. This move is part of the U.S. government's effort to prevent the use of covered products in Chinese supercomputers. The restrictions are expected to cause a decoupling of US and China AI semiconductor supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>
