        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid slim party margins, the possibility of a tie vote in the U.S. House of Representatives has become more relevant, as seen during a February 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to established House rules, any measure that results in a tie vote is automatically considered to have failed. This procedural reality underscores the challenges of governing with a razor-thin majority, where every single vote is critical for passing legislation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has lifted export controls on chip design software destined for China, as announced by the American software company Synopsys. This move reverses a policy implemented in May that required companies like Synopsys to obtain special licenses for exporting semiconductor-related goods and software to China. Synopsys stated it is now working to restore access to its products for Chinese clients. The policy change suggests a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade dispute between the two countries, although the U.S. Commerce Department has not yet commented.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are working to secure enough votes to pass a major tax and spending bill supported by President Donald Trump, facing opposition from both moderate and conservative members of their party. The legislative process stalled as holdouts demanded changes to the Senate-passed version of the bill, which includes significant tax cuts and spending on immigration enforcement. The White House has been directly involved, with Trump meeting with lawmakers to persuade them to support the package. The slim Republican majority means Speaker Mike Johnson has very little room for defections to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

The vessel was en route to Bali when it reportedly experienced engine trouble before sinking late Wednesday night.

This revival is fueled by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and concerns over potential U.S. delistings.

The judge's order applies nationwide to all individuals covered by the president's executive order, which had declared the border situation an "invasion."

          <p>An official report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) has found that historical child grooming investigations were significantly delayed by Manchester City Council's excessive redaction of evidence. The watchdog noted that some documents provided to police were so heavily redacted they were unusable, making it impossible to assess their value. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules, but has since agreed to a new, more efficient process with police. The report also acknowledged that Greater Manchester Police has made significant improvements in its approach to investigating such cases.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that menopausal women under 55 using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy face an increased risk of breast cancer. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, typically prescribed to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines the understanding of hormone replacement therapy, which has been a subject of evolving scientific consensus. Experts emphasize that the findings highlight the importance of personalized medical advice based on treatment type and individual health factors.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, has pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, avoiding a potential death penalty sentence. In a court hearing, Kohberger admitted to killing Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogen in their off-campus home. As part of the plea agreement, he will receive multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole and waives his right to appeal. The deal has drawn mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing relief at avoiding a lengthy trial while others felt let down.</p>

          <p>A group of former federal health officials is warning that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could have severe negative health consequences for Americans. The proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would slash the CDC's funding by over 50%, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The former officials, speaking at a press conference, argued that these cuts would cripple vital programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention. They also noted that state and local health departments, which receive about 80% of the CDC's domestic budget, would be devastated.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, prosecutors detailed the key evidence that led to his arrest for the 2022 Idaho student murders. The investigation relied on cell phone tracking, surveillance video, and crucial DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene. The breakthrough came when investigators secretly collected trash from Kohberger's family home in Pennsylvania and found a Q-tip with his father's DNA, which established a familial link to the DNA on the sheath. This summary of evidence provides new insight into the police work that solved the case, although Kohberger's motive remains unknown.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this rightward shift is not necessarily ideological but rather a move toward populism driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic party. Some analysts argue that Democrats failed to maintain a working-class agenda, while others point to a backlash against progressive immigration policies among naturalized citizens. The trend indicates a dynamic and evolving Latino electorate that defies simple categorization by either party.</p>

The farewell show will feature a reunion with his original bandmates and performances by other major rock acts. Despite a life of excess and several near-retirements, this performance is widely seen as the true swansong for one of rock music's most enduring figures.</p>

          <p>A jury has ordered a man who participated in the January 6 Capitol riot to pay $500,000 to the widow of D.C. police officer Jeffrey Smith. Erin Smith filed a wrongful death lawsuit against David Walls-Kaufman, alleging his assault on her husband during the riot led to the trauma that resulted in his suicide nine days later. The verdict was a "relief" for Smith, who has become an advocate for recognizing police suicides linked to on-the-job trauma as line-of-duty deaths.

          <p>The Pentagon believes that recent U.S. airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities have delayed the country's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's claim that the program was "obliterated," but it suggests significant damage was inflicted. Intelligence indicates that centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site were destroyed, a critical blow to Iran's ability to produce enriched uranium. The assessment comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, making future verification of its program more difficult.</p>
