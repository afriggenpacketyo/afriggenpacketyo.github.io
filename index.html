          <h2>South Korean Semiconductor Exports to China Decline Amid US Tech Restrictions</h2>

          <p>South Korea's semiconductor exports to China have fallen significantly, dropping 31.8% year-on-year in February. This decline follows the US implementation of new export restrictions on advanced semiconductors to China, aimed at hindering Beijing's progress in AI and other high-tech sectors. The decrease is greater than the January contraction and contrasts with a 2024 rally that boosted South Korea's economy.</p>
