          <p>A former classmate of Blaze Bernstein, a brilliant college student, was convicted for his murder in a case prosecuted as a hate crime. The perpetrator, identified as a member of a secret neo-Nazi group, was found to have killed Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The case drew national attention, highlighting the tragic consequences of extremist ideology. The article details the trial and the journey of Bernstein's family, who have since worked to transform their grief into advocacy against hate.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge recently hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone faster than any other player in MLB history. He reached the mark in his 1,088th game, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire, who did it in 1,280 games. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team victory would have made the moment better. The two-time AL MVP continues a dominant season, leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.</p>

          <p>The case of Suzanne Morphew, a mother of two who vanished on Mother's Day, has been marked by a series of strange developments. Key clues in the investigation included a chipmunk alibi provided by her husband, the discovery of a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen. After her remains were found containing tranquilizer drugs, her husband was rearrested for her murder. The investigation suggests her body was moved at least twice, adding layers of complexity to the tragic case.</p>

          <p>Talks are scheduled between the UK's Health Secretary and the British Medical Association (BMA) to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike, set to begin on July 25, stems from an ongoing pay dispute, with doctors arguing their real-terms pay has fallen significantly since 2008. The government has offered a 5.4% increase but insists it cannot improve the offer, while the BMA will only call off the strike if a credible new proposal is presented to its members.</p>

          <p>The family of Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Tampa, reports that he was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. Musallet was visiting family and was allegedly attacked while protecting his family's land. According to his relatives and the Palestinian Health Ministry, an ambulance was blocked from reaching him for hours. The U.S. State Department confirmed the death of a citizen and is providing consular assistance, while the family calls for a U.S.-led investigation into the killing.</p>

          <p>An excavation has started at the site of a former church-run mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of 796 babies and young children. The St Mary's home operated from 1925 to 1961, housing unmarried women and their children. The discovery of the grave, potentially in a former sewage tank, was made by an amateur historian and later confirmed by a government investigation. The two-year excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a dark chapter of Irish history to light.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, effective August 1. The move represents a major escalation in the administration's trade policy, impacting two of America's largest trading partners. In letters to the leaders, Trump cited persistent trade deficits and, in Mexico's case, insufficient efforts to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The announcement has been met with disapproval from both the EU and Mexico, raising fears of a broader global trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from indiscriminately detaining people without reasonable suspicion. The ruling also bars officials from denying individuals access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a bus stop. Judge Maame Frimpong stated there was a 'mountain of evidence' that officials were unconstitutionally basing arrests on factors like race or speaking Spanish.</p>
