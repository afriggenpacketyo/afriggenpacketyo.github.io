          <p>A planned trial to display political advertisements on convenience store electronic signage in Japan has been canceled by the association for digital transformation of policy and public affairs. The trial, scheduled to begin at FamilyMart stores in Tokyo, aimed to encourage young people's interest in politics amid low voter turnout, and the company official said that the dates were not met as they carefully considered whether to participate in the trial. The association announced the initiative on May 20, with members including lawmakers and advertising industry figures, and they held a press conference in the Diet attended by senior members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition parties. FamilyMart will continue studying ways to improve voter turnout using digital signage, which demonstrates the store's commitment to contributing to the democratic process. The cancellation reflects the complexities and sensitivities involved in integrating political advertising into commercial spaces.</p>

          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while Huawei's Ascend chips lag behind U.S. chips by a generation, state-of-the-art performance can be achieved through tactics like "stacking and clustering." Ren's comments, in an interview with People's Daily, suggest that Washington's sanctions have not entirely hindered China's technological advancements, particularly in AI. He highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network, and he also noted that there will be hundreds of open source software programs in the future to meet the needs of the entire society. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued guidance indicating that the use of Ascend chips globally could violate American export controls, so Ren's comments come at a time when Washington is ramping up restrictions on China and Huawei Technologies is in the eye of the storm.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on Odesa, Ukraine, resulted in one death and at least four injuries, as reported by Ukrainian authorities. The strikes hit a maternity hospital, an emergency medical facility, and residential buildings, and regional governor Oleh Kiper confirmed the death of a 59-year-old man. Hospital patients and staff were evacuated before the strikes, which caused significant damage to buildings, and photos shared by Kiper showed shattered windows and damaged building facades. The event underscores the ongoing conflict's impact on civilian infrastructure and the human cost of the war, and medics are treating those wounded in the attacks.</p>

          <p>Amidst protests in Los Angeles, U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the deployed National Guard and Marines, stating that their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition. These troops are tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel, not patrolling streets or detaining protesters, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. The rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done, and the personnel are operating under rules that call for de-escalation. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies to ensure a coordinated response, highlighting the logistical challenges of federal military presence, and the military is defining the mission as non-law enforcement.</p>

The area, once a stronghold of New Deal Democrats, overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump in 2024, reflecting a sense of abandonment by modern Democrats. Despite Trump's promises, James Browning, a drug counselor, notes the lack of tangible improvements, and the article underscores the complex relationship between policy promises and the lived experiences of people in this region.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to curb rising prices, as announced by farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move will leave the country with a 100,000-ton rice reserve, and the released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators and major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, and the government expects the cheaper rice sold through direct contracts to lower overall prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and the 2020 rice is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg.</p>

          <p>Barbara Kruger's mural "Questions" at MOCA's Geffen Contemporary in downtown Los Angeles has become a resonant backdrop for protests against ICE raids and the National Guard deployment. The mural, featuring questions about power and control, was commissioned in 1990 and poses queries like "Who is beyond the law?" and "Who follows orders?" Kruger noted that the current situation is giving Trump what he wants, which is the moment he can declare martial law, and she also said that she hopes that in the 30 years since, things would have changed a bit. The museum closed early on Sunday due to the protests, and the only damage was some graffiti, and the mural's themes of power and authority have gained renewed significance amidst the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to "kickstart" economic growth, and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary for a "golden age of clean energy." Alison Downes, director of Stop Sizewell C, criticized the lack of transparency about the project's cost and incomplete negotiations with private investors. The government insists nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, but Sizewell C will take at least a decade to complete, and the final investment decision is due later this summer.</p>

The other company, Global Networks, will include CNN, Discovery, and TNT Sports, led by Gunnar Wiedenfels, and Warner Bros Discovery president and chief executive David Zaslav said this will empower iconic brands with sharper focus and strategic flexibility.

The aircraft's distinctive features streamline the airframe while enhancing maneuverability, and the J-36's features are similar to the initial J-20 , which bore the number “2001”.

          <p>Kyiv is experiencing a relentless aerial assault, with residents reporting waves of drones and missiles and near-constant explosions. Dozens of drones were launched toward Ukraine's capital, and while many were intercepted, some reached their targets, causing fires across multiple districts. Authorities have confirmed at least two injuries, and the attack follows a day after Russian forces targeted regions throughout Ukraine with over 470 attack drones. Earlier, Russia and Ukraine conducted the first stage of a prisoner swap following an agreement made during peace talks in Istanbul.</p>

The report states that paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes" and require significant investment to address, and statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving £187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach, and the government is carrying out a review to see how it can best support working families.</p>

Team member Tam Pham recalled that the idea for the project began in a college-prep seminar course, where students were expected to choose and research a topic, and her classmate Smriti Monger stumbled upon a webpage titled “Pacific Ocean Atrocities”.

The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking, and teachers must check the results for accuracy. Teachers are also encouraged to be transparent about their use of AI, and the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges the potential for AI to free up time for teaching but notes that significant issues still need to be addressed. The Chartered Institute for IT also said it was an "important step forward" but teachers would "want clarity on exactly how they should be telling... parents where they've used AI".</p>
