        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comedian and actor Russell Brand appeared in a London court on Friday to face multiple charges of sexual assault, including two counts of sexual assault. The charges relate to alleged offenses between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Brand, who has denied all charges, arrived at Westminster Magistrates Court accompanied by bodyguards. The initial hearing was largely procedural, with the case being referred to a higher court for further proceedings. Brand's next court appearance is scheduled for 30 May, with the actual trial potentially beginning a year from now due to judicial backlogs.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump suggested that Republicans should consider expelling Democrats from Congress, responding to renewed impeachment threats against him. Trump criticized Democrats as being "out of control" and asserted that they were using impeachment as a weapon. This statement follows Representative Shri Thanedar's announcement of articles of impeachment against Trump. Trump suggested that Republicans should retaliate by expelling Democrats for their alleged crimes, particularly related to elections. He also referenced Adam Schiff's supposed need for a pardon, alleging misconduct by the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's actions in his second term's first 100 days are closely aligned with Project 2025, a conservative manifesto advocating for consolidating power in the executive branch. Several individuals associated with Project 2025 have been appointed to key roles in the Trump administration, enabling them to implement the project's plans. Trump has signed executive orders and taken actions that dismantle government programs, end diversity efforts, and restrict immigration, mirroring the project's recommendations. While Trump's campaign once distanced itself from Project 2025, his administration's policies now reflect many of its goals, including restructuring trade, reducing the size of the federal government, and reshaping the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is launching a campaign called ‚ÄúFight to Save Medicaid‚Äù targeting vulnerable House Republicans who may support a bill that could cut the social safety net to pay for tax cuts. The campaign will focus on Representatives Don Bacon, Mike Lawler, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Tom Barrett. The DNC plans to organize town halls and encourage voters to contact these lawmakers to express their opposition to the proposed cuts. Republicans aim to pass the bill, which would reduce government spending by at least $1.5 trillion, by Memorial Day, with potential cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll indicates that 80% of Americans believe the country would benefit from increased manufacturing, despite only 25% wanting to work in factories themselves. This discrepancy highlights the appeal of reindustrialization for overall societal improvement. Economists have long warned that the decline of manufacturing leads to social and economic decay. Manufacturing jobs offer higher wage potential and greater leverage for workers compared to many service jobs. Reindustrialization could improve trade negotiations, economic sovereignty, and social programs, and the left should consider industrial policies to win back working-class voters.</p>

Interviews with Trump fans at a rally in Michigan revealed strong belief in his leadership, particularly regarding the economy, immigration, and national security. Supporters expressed admiration for Trump's ally Elon Musk and his efforts to streamline government. They see short-term economic challenges as necessary for long-term gains and trust Trump's commitment to making America great again.

          <p>After Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, public support for his policies has declined, particularly regarding the economy, trade, and immigration.

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, according to flash data from Eurostat, failing to meet expectations of a decrease. Core inflation rose to 2.7%, and services inflation increased to 3.9%. Economists suggest the rise in services inflation is due to Easter timing effects, which are expected to reverse in the coming month. This steady inflation rate keeps the door open for further interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank (ECB). ECB President Christine Lagarde indicated the bank would remain data-dependent when making interest rate decisions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance has warned that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is not likely to end "any time soon." Speaking on Fox News, Vance said the Trump administration is working to "find some middle ground" to stop the conflict. His comments follow the signing of a long-awaited minerals deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. Vance expressed optimism about peace talks but acknowledged that Russia and Ukraine will "have to take the final step." The U.S. and Ukraine signed an economic partnership providing Washington with preferential access to some of Kyiv's natural resources.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is proving to be a threat to both the Conservatives and Labour, demonstrated by its performance in recent local elections. The party secured a victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election and achieved significant vote shares in mayoral contests. Reform's success indicates that healthy opinion poll figures can translate into actual votes and victories. Analysts note that Reform's ability to attract voters from both major parties poses a challenge for the Conservatives and Labour. The election results will shape the political conversation in the coming months, prompting the government to recalibrate its focus and strategy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order calling for all federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) to be blocked. Trump alleged that both organizations have engaged with "biased and partisan news coverage." The order instructs the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, who distributes funding to PBS and NPR stations, to "cease direct funding" to the "maximum extent allowed by law." The White House has said that funding of news media is "not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence."</p>

          <p>The upcoming jobs report will provide the first glimpse into the U.S. economy's performance following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement. Economists expect the U.S. to have added 133,000 jobs in April, a slowdown from the previous month. The jobs data arrives after a report showed the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of 2025, due to Trump's tariff proposals causing uncertainty among businesses and consumers. Despite the economic uncertainty, the labor market has remained strong. Recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as Trump's tariffs threaten to disrupt global trade.</p>

          <p>Federal officials are building a new database system called "ImmigrationOS" to track and target millions of people living illegally in the United States. A $30 million contract with Palantir Technologies will help ICE agents prioritize people for deportation. The system will merge data from multiple databases from the government and private sources. Civil liberties groups warn the system could be repurposed to track any American.

Carney aims to balance economic knowledge, strategy, and personal diplomacy in dealing with Trump, while maintaining Canada's sovereignty.</p>

More companies are warning that they will have to pass on higher costs to consumers due to increased tariffs on imported goods and materials.

The elimination of a loophole that allowed low-value items from China to enter the U.S. without import fees has also contributed to price increases.

Legal observers suggest Harvard aims to emphasize the importance of academic freedom. Unlike previous cases, Harvard faces billions of dollars in federal funds being at risk if it loses the case.</p>

He highlights Dr. King's belief in the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems.
