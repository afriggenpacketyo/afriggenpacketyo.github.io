          <p>Over 1,100 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the English Channel, marking the highest daily number in 2025. Defence Secretary John Healey criticized the situation, stating Britain has "lost control of its borders" and described the scenes of migrants being transported by smugglers as "shocking". The total number of arrivals this year has reached 14,811, a significant increase compared to previous years. The Home Office acknowledged the need to end dangerous small boat crossings and dismantle the people-smuggling networks. </p>

Musk also expresses disappointment with a massive spending bill that undermines DOGE's work and confirms his departure from the administration, shifting his focus back to his companies like Tesla and SpaceX, which he believes improve the trajectory of civilization.

DelBene highlights the 35 districts in play and emphasizes that Democrats only need three more seats to take back the majority. Despite historical trends favoring the party out of power in midterm elections, the current political map appears to favor Republicans, but DelBene remains confident that the party's focus on important issues will lead to success. The Democrats are facing a polling dilemma because the party's ratings have been sinking to historic lows in a number of national surveys so far this year.</p>

The anthropologist also highlights the Denton Women’s Interracial Fellowship in Texas, which worked to desegregate their town and support Black families.

The author emphasizes that trust is built through small, consistent moments and by creating a safe space for children to express themselves.

          <p>Chinese researchers have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations in low visibility conditions, although some critics argue that night vision devices are more practical and powerful.</p>

Amid concerns about free speech rights, some commencement speakers have warned against Trump's abuses of power, while others have delivered more innocuous remarks. Trump himself has taken political shots during addresses, and universities are grappling with how to respond to Trump's efforts to exert more control over federal funding, campus protests, curriculum, and international student enrollment.

The show examines the tension between liberal and Orthodox interpretations of Judaism, highlighting the importance of interpretation and the search for meaning in religious rituals. The show ultimately suggests that religion can still have purpose for non-believers, as long as it is never too sure of itself.</p>
