          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, framing it as a necessary step to dismantle Hamas's remaining strongholds. The plan, which includes moving civilians to "safe zones," has drawn significant international criticism over fears of a worsening humanitarian crisis and increased danger to hostages. The announcement comes amid ongoing conflict, including a recent Israeli strike that killed several Al Jazeera journalists, and diplomatic efforts for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. The United States has defended Israel's right to self-defense at the UN Security Council, while other nations express alarm over the situation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, a trend linked to climate change that is causing significant shifts in marine ecosystems. This warming has led to the arrival of unusual species like octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish, which thrive in higher temperatures. Conversely, native cold-water species such as cod are struggling, posing serious challenges for local fishing communities who depend on them. Scientists warn that these marine heatwaves, driven by the ocean's absorption of excess heat from fossil fuel emissions, are becoming more frequent and intense.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner addressed social media comments criticizing her for attending an Oasis concert without her two children. After a user suggested she had forgotten her parental responsibilities, Turner replied by explaining the concept of shared custody, implying the children were with their father, her ex-husband Joe Jonas. The couple finalized their divorce in September after a contentious custody battle. Fans widely supported Turner's response, highlighting the double standards often faced by mothers in the public eye compared to their male counterparts.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old tourist from New York, identified as Kevin Mares, was killed in a shooting in the La Perla area of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.

          <p>Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly entered an unprecedented agreement with the U.S. government to secure export licenses for sales to China. The deal requires the companies to give the U.S. 15% of the revenue generated from sales of their specialized AI chips, specifically Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 models. This arrangement, a condition for obtaining the recently granted licenses, marks a novel approach by the Trump administration to regulate and benefit from critical technology exports to a key market. The move comes after the U.S. reversed a previous ban on the sale of these chips to China. (not investment advice)</p>

In May 1945, just days before the war's end, the ship was packed with thousands of prisoners in Lübeck Bay and was mistakenly bombed and sunk by the British Royal Air Force, who believed it was carrying fleeing Nazi officials. The attack resulted in one of the war's deadliest single incidents, with approximately 7,000 prisoners killed. The story, long overshadowed by other wartime events, is being brought to light by historians and the families of the few survivors.</p>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a plausible, though not yet proven in humans, link between nose-picking and an increased risk of dementia. Researchers found that damaging the nasal tissue can allow certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, a clearer path to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In response to this bacterial presence, the mouse brains produced amyloid-beta protein deposits, which are a key hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. While the findings are preliminary and require human studies for confirmation, they offer a new avenue for understanding the environmental factors that might contribute to the disease's onset.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey offered rare advice to a caller on his show, suggesting a home equity line of credit (HELOC) could be a viable option. The caller, a recently divorced father with an ultra-low 2.25% mortgage, needed to pay his ex-wife $150,000 for her share of their home's equity. Ramsey endorsed using a HELOC to restructure the debt owed to the ex-spouse but also questioned the caller's emotional reasons for keeping the house. He advised that while financially feasible, moving on to a new home might be a better long-term decision for a fresh start. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An in-depth report from the occupied West Bank details a significant increase in pressure and violence from Israeli settlers aimed at driving out Palestinian communities, particularly since the Hamas attacks of October 2023. This campaign, supported by hardline nationalist ministers in the Israeli government, is seen as part of a broader agenda to accelerate settlement expansion and prevent the possibility of a Palestinian state. Human rights groups and UN experts have documented a systemic pattern of intimidation, violence, and land dispossession, with settler attacks averaging four per day, effectively transforming the landscape and severing Palestinians from their land and livelihoods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to historian Rana Mitter of the Harvard Kennedy School, the impact of World War II on the formation of modern China is frequently underestimated. Mitter, an expert on the Japanese invasion of China, explains that the conflict was a pivotal event that fundamentally shaped the nation's trajectory. The war resulted in the widespread destruction of infrastructure built in the preceding decades, forcing China to essentially rebuild from scratch after 1945. This historical context is crucial for understanding China's subsequent political, social, and cultural development in the 80 years since the war's conclusion.</p>

          <p>A large gorse fire broke out on Arthur's Seat, a prominent hill in the center of Edinburgh, Scotland, prompting a significant response from the fire service. The blaze spread rapidly across the landmark in Holyrood Park, with smoke billowing over the city during a busy festival weekend. Authorities closed a large section of the park and urged the public to stay away from the area while four fire appliances and specialist resources worked to contain the flames. The incident follows several wildfire warnings issued across Scotland this year amid an unusually warm and dry summer.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has overturned a Trump administration directive that had allowed commercial fishing in the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that sought to reverse protections established by the Obama administration, thereby reinstating the ban on fishing in the protected waters. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, who filed the lawsuit, celebrated the decision as a victory for the rule of law and the protection of the monument's unique ecosystems, which are vital for vulnerable species and hold deep cultural significance for Indigenous Pacific Islanders.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded that homeless individuals in Washington D.C. be moved out "IMMEDIATELY" to locations "FAR from the Capital," in a series of social media posts. The president's comments came after his motorcade passed several encampments and he promised a news conference to address what he describes as out-of-control crime and squalor in the city. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back, stating that violent crime is actually at a 30-year low and criticized the president's rhetoric. Advocacy groups note that the city has around 800 unsheltered individuals, and the president lacks the legal authority to evict them from the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's 2-2 draw and subsequent penalty shootout loss to Crystal Palace in the Community Shield offered a first look at Arne Slot's revamped team. The match showcased the potential of new signings, with record acquisition Florian Wirtz playing a dominant role and fellow debutants Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong getting on the scoresheet. However, the game also exposed defensive vulnerabilities, as Liverpool twice surrendered a lead and appeared shaky at the back, a continuation of issues seen in preseason. The performance suggests that while the team's attack looks promising, time and likely further defensive reinforcements are needed to fix the system's bugs.</p>
