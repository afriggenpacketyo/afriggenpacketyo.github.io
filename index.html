          <p>A major cyberattack at Columbia University has compromised the sensitive personal, financial, and health information of almost 870,000 people, including students, employees, and applicants. The breach was discovered following a network outage in June, with the university confirming an unauthorized party stole approximately 460 gigabytes of data. Columbia is now notifying affected individuals, offering two years of complimentary credit monitoring, and has stated it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts to strengthen its systems against future incidents.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is conducting a significant reshuffle of his government's top positions, following the departure of Yvette Cooper from the Home Office. The changes include moving several ministers, such as Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson, to new roles while appointing others to key posts in the Home Office and Cabinet Office. This restructuring aims to refresh the government's direction, particularly on issues like illegal immigration, and to bring in new figures with private sector experience, like Grimsby Town vice-chairman Jason Stockwood.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in at least 150 arrests. Hundreds gathered in Parliament Square to protest the ban, which classifies supporting the group as a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The Metropolitan Police made arrests for various offenses, including expressing support for a banned organization, amid tensions where protesters accused officers of supporting genocide. Organizers and civil liberties groups like Amnesty International criticized the arrests as an infringement on the right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>Despite an extended trade truce between the U.S. and China, American farmers in the Midwest are experiencing a significant drop in exports as Beijing increasingly turns to other suppliers, such as Brazil. The article highlights a divide within the farming community: some remain hopeful that President Trump's approach will eventually secure more stable trade, while others fear the loss of the massive Chinese market is permanent. This uncertainty leaves many agricultural producers in a precarious position, questioning the long-term benefits of the current trade policies.</p>

          <p>New economic policies in Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, aimed at diversifying away from oil and reducing public sector employment, are creating social friction. "Emiratization" and "Saudization" rules, which mandate hiring more local citizens, are clashing with efforts to attract skilled foreign workers, who are now sometimes seen as rivals in the private sector. This shift is challenging the traditional social contract, where the state was the primary employer, and leading to cultural unease over loosened social restrictions designed to make the region more appealing to expatriates.</p>

          <p>The article challenges President Trump's repeated claims that cities like Chicago are the "most dangerous," pointing out that violent crime rates have been falling nationwide. An analysis of crime data reveals that the four large cities with the highest murder rates in 2024—Jackson, Birmingham, St. Louis, and Memphis—are all located in Republican-led states. While Trump threatens to deploy troops to Democratic-run cities, the data shows that, in aggregate, large cities in blue states have lower murder rates than those in red states.</p>

          <p>Germany's pay-as-you-go pension system, established in the 1950s, is under severe strain due to demographic shifts, with a declining birth rate and an aging population. As the large baby boomer generation begins to retire, there are far fewer workers to support the growing number of pensioners, threatening the system's viability.
