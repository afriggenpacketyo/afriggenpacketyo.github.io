        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing a more than decade-long increase in government debt and interest payment ratios. The credit rating firm noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. Moody's expects federal deficits to increase significantly by 2035. This action follows similar downgrades by Standard and Poor's in 2011 and Fitch Ratings in 2023, further highlighting concerns about the nation's fiscal trajectory.</p>

          <p>Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates stated that Vladimir Putin believes it is his destiny to recreate the Russian Empire and will not back down in Ukraine. Gates, who served under Presidents Bush and Obama, believes Putin wants to occupy the eastern provinces of the Donbas, perpetually recognize Russian ownership of Crimea, install a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, and demilitarize Ukraine, preventing its membership in NATO and the EU. President Trump is reportedly planning direct talks with Putin, but Gates believes Putin is unlikely to make any major concessions and wants Ukraine to be a client state of Russia.</p>

          <p>New CDC modeling suggests that hundreds of drowning deaths could be prevented each year with better pool fencing and consistent use of life jackets during boating activities. Researchers estimated that 51 deaths could have been prevented by adequate pool fencing and 297 by wearing life jackets during boating accidents in 2022. The study highlights the economic cost of these preventable deaths, estimating it at $4.5 billion annually. The study was one of the last produced by the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs eliminated the CDC's drowning prevention research teams.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, allowing them to challenge their removals. The court ruled that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the detainees' appeal and emphasized that they did not receive sufficient notice. While the court did not address the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, it directed lower courts to handle such cases expeditiously. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, arguing the Supreme Court should have addressed the underlying questions immediately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on states that provide state-funded benefits to undocumented immigrants, challenging what Democratic state leaders believed was free from federal interference. Through executive orders, investigations, and proposed legislation, the federal government aims to penalize states that use their own funds to provide healthcare and other services to undocumented immigrants. This has led to divisions among Democrats, with some arguing for continued support for immigrants and others scaling back benefits due to budgetary constraints. The situation has created a political wedge in Democratic states as they grapple with how to respond to the administration's actions.</p>

Council pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud, having executed a SIM swap attack to gain control of the SEC's account.

          <p>Crime rates in the United States are showing a decline after a significant increase in 2020. Murder rates are expected to have had the steepest fall in recorded history for 2024, and 2025 is off to a promising start with decreases in murder, violent crime, and property crime. The challenge in reporting on crime involves the lateness of official statistics, but available data indicates positive trends. Some experts believe the pandemic was the primary driver of the 2020 rise, citing unemployment and school closures in low-income areas as key factors.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the U.S. after receiving a removal order in 2005. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is charging her $500 for every day she has remained in the country since the order was issued. The woman's attorney argues that the removal order should be lifted because she has resided in the U.S. for over 10 years with no criminal record and is the mother of three U.S. citizen children. This case represents an enforcement of civil fines listed under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>

The World Bank plans to reengage with Syria, focusing initially on access to electricity. Severe electricity shortages continue to plague Syria, with state-supplied electricity amounting to as little as two hours per day.</p>
