          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that TikTok will cease operations for American users unless China agrees to US control over the popular social media platform. This decision stems from ongoing concerns among lawmakers that the Chinese government could access sensitive user data or manipulate content. The Trump administration has extended the divestment deadline for ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese owner, to September 17th. Lutnick emphasized that US ownership and control of the technology and algorithm are non-negotiable for the app to remain accessible in America.</p>

          <p>Daniel Gunter has been found guilty of murdering his two-week-old premature son, Brendon Staddon, in a Yeovil District Hospital neonatal ward. Brendon suffered severe injuries, including a fractured skull and broken neck. Nursing staff had previously raised concerns about Gunter's rough handling and angry behavior. This tragic case, described by police as "evil" due to the extent of the baby's injuries, highlights a profound act of violence against a vulnerable infant.</p>

          <p>A new report by the AFL-CIO reveals that CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased by 7% in 2024, widening the inequality gap with average worker salaries to 285 to 1. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, for instance, earned 6,666 times more than his typical employee. This rise in executive compensation is occurring just before President Trump's reconciliation bill is set to provide substantial tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, including an estimated $489,118 average cut for S&P 500 CEOs. Critics argue this policy will further benefit the rich at the expense of public services and jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Eagle shares experienced a significant jump, positioning the company to become the latest "meme stock" fueled by individual investors. The surge follows the announcement of a new denim campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, tapping into the growing popularity of Western styles. High short interest in American Eagle also contributed to the volatile trading, as investors betting against the stock moved to cover their positions, driving artificial buying. This rally offers a temporary reprieve for the stock, which had previously declined by about 35% in 2025.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines' stock dropped approximately 10% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street expectations. The airline significantly cut its 2025 earnings forecast, from an earlier estimate of $1.7 billion to a new range of $600 million to $800 million, citing economic uncertainty and weaker domestic travel demand. Despite this, CEO Bob Jordan noted a recent stabilization in travel demand. Southwest is also overhauling its business model, including moving to assigned seating and new boarding procedures, after basic economy sales initially suffered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Podcaster Joe Rogan has voiced strong concerns about the economic vulnerability of most Americans, stating that many are 'one catastrophe away from losing everything.' He elaborated on his views regarding the potential societal impact of artificial intelligence leading to job displacement, and the subsequent need for Universal Basic Income (UBI). While acknowledging UBI's potential, Rogan warned that it might not be a panacea, predicting potential chaos and addiction if individuals lack purpose in an automated future. He also criticized the current federal minimum wage as inadequate for living expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Airlines' shares declined after the company scaled back its 2025 profit outlook and issued a lower-than-expected third-quarter forecast. CEO Robert Isom attributed the revised forecast to ongoing domestic consumer weakness, flat corporate travel demand, and operational disruptions from recent storms. While international travel remains strong, passenger revenue per available domestic seat mile saw a significant drop. This follows similar adjustments from other major airlines, reflecting a challenging environment for the domestic travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to rescind the 2009 'endangerment finding,' which concluded that greenhouse gases harm American health and underpins the government's authority to regulate climate pollution. Experts, including a former EPA official involved in the original finding, argue this move ignores 'clearcut' science that has only strengthened since 2009, evidenced by escalating extreme weather events. Critics warn that repealing this finding would dismantle limits on pollution and severely hinder future efforts to address the climate crisis, potentially leading to devastating consequences for public health.</p>
