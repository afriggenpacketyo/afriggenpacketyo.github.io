          <p>Despite temporary tariff reprieves, a private survey reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters are planning to increase exports to markets outside the U.S. due to the intense trade war. The U.S.-China "decoupling" is expected to continue, with Chinese exporters pivoting away from the U.S. and American firms shifting production out of China. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is becoming a top choice for Chinese businesses seeking to move production overseas, while Vietnam faces mixed perceptions due to rising costs. Allianz Trade estimates that global exports could see a loss of $305 billion this year because of trade conflicts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen, a long-time political opponent of Donald Trump, criticized the Trump administration as corrupt and treasonous during a concert in England. In response, Trump called Springsteen a ‚Äúdried out prune of a rocker‚Äù and suggested that Springsteen and Beyonc√© should be investigated for illegal campaign donations. Springsteen repeated his criticisms the following night, showing he wasn't afraid to speak out. Springsteen has a history of challenging presidents politically, documenting the lives of struggling immigrants, and criticizing police brutality, even angering some of his fan base. </p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. More than half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, decreasing reliance on China. This pricing strategy differs from Walmart, which plans to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot reported first-quarter earnings that missed expectations but beat sales estimates, with comparable sales dropping 0.3% across the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Smartphone exports from China to the United States, including Apple‚Äôs iPhone, experienced a significant drop in April, reaching their lowest levels since 2011. The decline is attributed to the Trump administration‚Äôs tariffs, which have disrupted tech supply chains and diverted electronics production. Smartphone exports slid 72% to just under US$700 million last month, outpacing an overall 21% drop in Chinese shipments to the US. Tensions remain high, with Beijing accusing the Trump administration of undermining trade talks by pursuing sanctions on Huawei Technologies artificial intelligence chips.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, who were protected from deportation and allowed to work in the United States. The court approved the administration‚Äôs emergency request to lift a lower court‚Äôs order that barred it from ending the protections. Lawyers representing TPS holders expressed shock at the decision, noting the humanitarian and economic impact. The decision leaves hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants in legal uncertainty, and the ruling's lack of clarity has been criticized as callous.</p>

          <p>Retiree and disability beneficiaries are increasingly worried about payment delays and service disruptions due to cuts in the U.S. social security system. The agency has been a target of the ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù (Doge), leading to staffing shortages and backlogs. Approximately 3,500 employees have taken voluntary separation agreements, with plans to cut staff by at least 7,000. Beneficiaries report experiencing delays and increased fears of denied benefits or late payments, amid rising living costs.</p>

          <p>Japan is considering backing off its demand for a full removal of new U.S. tariffs to strike a trade deal with the United States. The idea emerged as Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is arranging to visit the United States for the third round of bilateral ministerial-level talks. The Trump administration has already reached tariff-cutting agreements with China and Britain. The prime minister has shrugged off calls for the farm chief to resign over rice gaffe.</p>

          <p>This article details the 1965 debate between William F. Buckley Jr. and James Baldwin at the Cambridge Union, focusing on race in America. Buckley, a conservative, and Baldwin, a celebrated writer, clashed over the American dream and the Black experience. Baldwin's words were described as sermon-like, stunning the audience into silence, while Buckley was seen as disconnected and ad hominem. The article explores the lead-up to the debate, including Buckley's views on apartheid and Wills's critique of Baldwin's work.</p>

          <p>This article presents letters to the editor responding to a previous article on why COVID deniers won. Readers emphasize the importance of valid skepticism toward the government during crises, and the rushed nature of the vaccines. One physician argues that COVID's relatively low lethality compared to other viruses allowed for denial, and that the next pandemic could be more devastating. The responses also highlight the ethical failings of the American healthcare system, with one reader suggesting the need to agree that it is dead wrong for anyone, in any way, to profit from hurting people.</p>
