          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has voiced significant concerns that the United States is underestimating the progress and complexity of China's artificial intelligence capabilities. He argued that simple export controls on semiconductors are unlikely to be an effective long-term solution, as China could develop workarounds like building its own fabrication facilities. Altman also revealed that competition from Chinese open-source models was a major factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models, aiming to prevent the global developer ecosystem from becoming dominated by Chinese technology.</p>

          <p>Many Nevadans, including senior citizens and veterans, are facing increased food insecurity due to rising grocery prices and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Southern Nevada's primary food bank, Three Square, reports that its partner pantries are feeling the strain of higher demand. Recent changes in President Trump's major tax and spending plan have shifted more SNAP costs to states and implemented stricter requirements for recipients, creating uncertainty for vulnerable populations in a state with limited options for raising new revenue to cover the costs.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, a woman known as the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges, including one count of distributing ketamine resulting in death, related to the fatal overdose of actor Matthew Perry. Sangha is one of five individuals, including doctors, accused of supplying Perry with the drug, exploiting his addiction for profit. Federal prosecutors described her Los Angeles home as a "drug-selling emporium" where they found numerous vials of ketamine and other illicit substances, linking her to a broader Hollywood drug network.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Plan to End Mail-In Voting and Use of Voting Machines via Executive Order</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to "lead a movement" to eliminate mail-in ballots and certain voting machines for U.S. elections, starting with an executive order he claims is currently being drafted. He asserted, without providing evidence, that these voting methods are corrupt and inaccurate. However, legal experts state that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate how states conduct elections, as that power resides with Congress and the states themselves, making any such executive order highly susceptible to legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation reveals that many women in Afghanistan's largest mental health facility are effectively trapped, unable to leave even after their condition improves because they have nowhere to go. Strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions make it nearly impossible for women to live independently, forcing them to remain institutionalized if their male relatives refuse to take them back. The facility is overwhelmed, with a growing waiting list, as the country faces a worsening mental health crisis among women, exacerbated by the crackdown on their rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis explores the escalating federal presence in Washington, D.C., a week after President Trump's takeover, questioning the mission's objective and ultimate conclusion. With National Guard troops from several states arriving and no clear emergency cited, the deployment appears more like an improvisational power grab than a structured response to crime. The article raises concerns that without a defined goal, the federal occupation could continue indefinitely and potentially serve as a model for similar interventions in other Democrat-run cities across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill designed to ensure that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive the interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. Previously, when insurers issued checks, lenders would deposit the funds into an escrow account and could keep the accrued interest while homeowners waited for rebuilding funds to be released. The new legislation, which now goes to the governor, guarantees homeowners will receive at least 2% interest on these funds held by lenders.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist who helped discover the SARS coronavirus, has warned that the emergence of another pandemic is inevitable. He expressed concern that the world may not be significantly better prepared than it was before COVID-19, highlighting respiratory viruses as a primary threat. Peiris noted that animal viruses have been jumping to humans with increasing frequency in recent decades and stressed the need to build a more resilient global system that integrates human, animal, and environmental health to prevent future catastrophic outbreaks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security reported that a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent fired at a moving vehicle in San Bernardino County after the driver sped away from an immigration stop.

An immigrant advocacy group, providing the family's account, stated the agents smashed the car's windows without cause, prompting the driver to flee in fear, with video capturing the sound of shots being fired as they drove away.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional voting maps have returned to the state capital, declaring their protest a victory. By breaking the legislature's quorum for weeks, they stalled the process and drew national attention to what they call a "racist map" designed to increase the GOP's majority. Although Governor Greg Abbott has called another session where the plan is expected to pass, the Democrats vow to challenge the map in court, as other Democratic states prepare their own redistricting countermeasures.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement that he was arranging a meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin has remained noncommittal about the proposal. While Trump suggested a one-on-one meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in the works, a Russian official would only confirm that Putin would consider "raising the level" of the current negotiations between the two countries' delegations. This reserved response casts doubt on the immediate prospects of a direct presidential summit to resolve the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>General David Allvin, the U.S. Air Force chief of staff, has unexpectedly announced his intention to retire, effective around November 1. This move is surprising as it cuts his four-year assignment short after only two years, and no specific reason was provided for his early departure. The announcement comes amid a series of dismissals of senior military officials by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth since January, though it remains unclear whether General Allvin chose to retire or was asked to step down by Pentagon leadership.</p>

The union's president stated they are willing to face penalties, including fines or jail time, and will only return to work after a negotiated settlement is reached over demands for higher wages and better compensation.</p>
