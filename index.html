          <p>Tripadvisor's Transparency Report 2025 indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount detected in 2022. The increase in detections is attributed to Tripadvisor's evolving policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in their detection systems, which rely on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback. Paid reviews, often originating in Asia, are considered the most pernicious type of fake submissions, and Tripadvisor uses various techniques, including AI and behavioral biometrics, to identify and penalize violators. The company admits they will never reach absolute perfection in catching fake reviews but that they are getting better at detecting them every year.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the deadline from June 1 to July 9 to allow for further negotiations. This decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a commitment to serious negotiations. Trump's initial threat to impose the tariffs had caused market instability, particularly concerning potential tariffs on Apple products, but the extension offers a window for the U.S. and EU to reach a trade agreement, as both parties affirmed their commitment to swift and decisive talks.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on the cases of two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who claim they were scapegoated for rigging interest rates, potentially overturning convictions secured in nine criminal trials. Evidence has emerged suggesting that central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct on a larger scale, but were not prosecuted. Senior politicians have voiced concerns about a miscarriage of justice, prompting renewed calls for a public inquiry into the larger interest rate "rigging" ordered by central banks and governments worldwide.

His father, Frank Larkin, advocated for research into these injuries, leading to studies and legislation aimed at modifying weapons and training to protect brain safety.

          <p>Frank Larkin's search for answers after his son Ryan's suicide has led the military to modify training and weapons to address previously unknown brain injuries. Ryan, a Navy SEAL, suffered from depression linked to low-level blast exposure from his own weapons, which caused microscopic scarring in his brain. This discovery prompted research into the effects of cumulative blasts on service members, resulting in changes to training practices, weapon modifications, and increased awareness of brain health. Frank Larkin's advocacy has been instrumental in driving these changes, aiming to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Fogo Island, a remote Canadian fishing community, is experiencing a revitalization thanks to the efforts of local Zita Cobb, who returned home after making a fortune in the tech sector. Cobb built the Fogo Island Inn, a luxury inn that serves as an economic engine, reinvesting profits into the island through a charitable trust called Shorefast. Shorefast supports local businesses, provides employment opportunities, and promotes the island's unique culture and hospitality. The efforts have helped stabilize the population and bring new life to the community, but also present challenges such as rising home costs.</p>

Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, respond without shaming, and view "bad" behavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. The article emphasizes that emotionally safe parenting is about creating a safe space for children to express big emotions and show up as their authentic selves.</p>
