          <p>Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging designs to mislead customers. The lawsuit claims that Aldi's store-brand products, such as Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies and Thin Wheat, mimic the font, colors, and image placement of Mondelez's Nutter Butter and Wheat Thins. Mondelez seeks monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling the allegedly infringing products. This isn't Aldi's first trademark lawsuit, as they previously lost a case in the UK over cider packaging similarities.</p>

          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is known for his pessimistic economic outlook, often warning of potential crises and downturns. Despite his gloomy predictions, JPMorgan Chase has experienced significant growth and profitability under his leadership, becoming the world's most valuable publicly traded financial firm. Some analysts suggest Dimon's cautious stance is a strategic move to keep his team focused and prevent complacency, while others believe it's wiser for bankers to broadcast caution rather than optimism. Regardless, Dimon's warnings haven't stopped JPMorgan from achieving record profits and investing heavily in technology like artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a lofty promise of cutting $1 trillion, DOGE has reportedly saved roughly $170 billion, though some analyses suggest the initiative could cost the government $135 billion.

          <p>Pride Toronto has lost Google and Home Depot as corporate sponsors, which the festival organizer says is a direct result of Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign to eradicate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the US. The departure of these sponsors follows similar moves by Nissan, Adidas, and Clorox. Organizers warn that the loss of sponsors will pose operational challenges for Pride Toronto.

The lawsuit stemmed from a 2021 Los Angeles Times investigation that questioned MontaÃ±ez's rags-to-riches story, which had long been a source of inspiration.

The legal battle highlights the ongoing trade tensions between the US and the EU, with the EU seeking a "zero-for-zero" tariff trade deal.
