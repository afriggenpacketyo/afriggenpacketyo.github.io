          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing political pressure after it was revealed that government officials were aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Starmer publicly defended him. The emails, sent before Epstein's 2008 imprisonment, expressed strong personal support, which Downing Street later cited as "new information" leading to Mandelson's dismissal as US ambassador. This incident has raised serious questions about the vetting process for high-level appointments and the flow of critical information to the prime minister, prompting calls for accountability.</p>

Her appointment, negotiated between the army, the president, and youth protest representatives, has brought a sense of calm to the capital, Kathmandu. In her first moves, Karki recommended and the president approved the dissolution of parliament and set new elections for March 5, aiming to address the economic woes and governance issues that fueled the widespread "GenZ" demonstrations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both declining birth rates and a need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers under 40 with doctoral degrees who are returning to work after childbirth. Initially targeting 20 researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to ease the transition back into demanding scientific careers. While its initial scope is limited, the policy is seen by some as a positive step toward creating a more supportive environment for women in science.</p>

          <p>An American woman recently released from Taliban custody has issued a dire warning about the health of an elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who remain imprisoned in Afghanistan. Faye Hall, who was detained with the couple, described their rapidly deteriorating condition in a maximum-security prison, stating they are "literally dying" and that "time is running out." The couple, who have lived in Afghanistan for years and hold Afghan citizenship, were arrested in February for unknown reasons. The case highlights the severe limitations of foreign consular support in the country and the perilous situation for any remaining Western nationals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill that would ban most law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that conceal their identities while on duty. The measure was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where federal agents wore facial coverings, which proponents argue instills fear and prevents accountability. While the bill includes exceptions for undercover operations or tactical gear, it has faced opposition from law enforcement groups who claim it would endanger officers. The legislation now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, though questions remain about the state's authority to enforce such a ban on federal personnel.</p>

          <p>Several NATO members, including Denmark, France, and Germany, are deploying additional troops and fighter jets to bolster the alliance's eastern flank. The move comes after Poland reported an unprecedented incursion of 19 Russian drones into its airspace, an incident Warsaw described as deliberate and the "closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two." While Moscow downplayed the event, the violation has significantly heightened tensions across Europe. The new mission, named Eastern Sentry, underscores NATO's commitment to defending its territory and responding to perceived Russian aggression near its borders.</p>

A spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command stated the action sent "wrong signals" and that its forces remain on high alert to safeguard national sovereignty. This transit follows a similar passage by Canadian and Australian naval vessels a week prior, reflecting a continued pattern of Western naval presence in the sensitive waterway, which Beijing views as a challenge to its territorial claims over Taiwan.</p>

          <p>A concrete border wall now runs through the Armenian village of Kirants, a direct consequence of the ongoing border demarcation process between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Based on Soviet-era maps, the new boundary has placed 15 hectares of land, including homes and farms, on the Azerbaijani side, leading to economic hardship and emotional distress for villagers. While the Armenian government has provided compensation, residents feel they have lost their homeland. Despite the division, some villagers acknowledge a significant decrease in cross-border conflict, as heavily armed soldiers have been replaced by border guards, bringing a fragile peace to the region.</p>

          <p>A commentary article argues that the culture revealed by Jeffrey Epstein's activities was a continuation of a widespread normalization of the sexual exploitation of young girls that pervaded the 1960s and 70s. The author reflects on how movies, rock music, and mainstream society frequently depicted or excused relationships between adult men and teenage girls, often blaming the young victims. The article posits that the rise of modern feminism was crucial in challenging this status quo by asserting women's rights, defining consent, and exposing the power imbalances inherent in such relationships. This shift in perspective reframed these acts as abuse rather than acceptable behavior.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes reflected on his career, motivations, and personal life. He credited his family and former manager Francesco Guidolin for shaping his journey and emphasized the importance of consistency and a team-first mentality on the pitch. Fernandes named Ronaldinho as his "first love in football" for the joy he brought to the game. Off the field, he described himself as a passionate but calm family man who gets more nervous watching games from the bench than playing in them, striving to live a normal life despite his fame.</p>

          <p>Exclusive CCTV footage shows the last known sighting of Sarm Heslop, a British woman who disappeared from a luxury yacht in the US Virgin Islands in 2021. The video shows her and her then-boyfriend, Ryan Bane, leaving a bar and motoring away in a dinghy. However, an inconsistency in the timeline suggests a missing hour before they would have reached their yacht, which police are keen to question Bane about. Bane, who has never been formally questioned and maintains she likely fell overboard, remains the sole person of interest in the case, which authorities now admit is at a "dead end."</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is anticipating significant success in local elections in Gelsenkirchen, a traditional stronghold of the center-left Social Democrats in western Germany. Capitalizing on local frustrations with issues like derelict housing and crime, which they link to immigration, the AfD is polling strongly and could see its mayoral candidate reach a runoff. This election is viewed as a key test of public opinion for the new national coalition government. The potential for an AfD mayor in western Germany would be a political first, alarming local social organizations who fear funding cuts for integration projects.</p>

          <p>The United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt have issued a joint call for an immediate three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan's devastating civil war. The plan proposed by the four nations, which hold influence with the warring factions, also outlines a subsequent permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transitional process to establish a civilian-led government. The conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The statement emphasized that there is no military solution and that Sudan's future must be decided by the Sudanese people.</p>
