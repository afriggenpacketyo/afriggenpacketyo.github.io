          <p>An attack on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado, injured eight people, with the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly yelling "Free Palestine" during the incident. The FBI is investigating the attack as a targeted act of terrorism, citing ideologically motivated violence. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were hospitalized with burns, and the incident occurred during a Run for Their Lives walk, which aimed to raise awareness about hostages in Gaza. Authorities are condemning the attack as an act of antisemitism, with upcoming events canceled until further notice, and the White House has been briefed on the situation.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate, has won Poland's presidential runoff election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski in a close race. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more nationalist direction, with Nawrocki backed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. While most day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president influences foreign policy and can veto legislation. Nawrocki, a historian known for nationalist views and removing Soviet monuments, succeeds Andrzej Duda, potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda.</p>

          <p>Monday's UK newspaper front pages highlight Keir Starmer's strategic defense review, with varying perspectives on its viability and funding. The Telegraph reports Defence Secretary John Healey appearing to backtrack on a commitment to boost defense spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, while the i Paper emphasizes the creation of 30,000 jobs through an expanded submarine fleet. Several papers also focus on Healey's remarks about losing control of migrant crossings in the English Channel, with the Daily Express quoting him saying small boat smugglers are running a 'taxi' service.

          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, also known as Soul Patts, and its affiliate Brickworks announced a merger valued at A$14 billion ($9 billion), causing their shares to surge. The merged entity will be listed in Sydney and will hold A$13.1 billion in assets across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China is refuting claims from the U.S. that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, accusing the U.S. of undermining the deal. Tensions escalated after the Trump administration imposed export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, prompting Beijing to vow countermeasures. China defends its grip on rare earths exports, and analysts suggest Beijing is comfortable taking a firm stance in negotiations, anticipating short-term peace rather than a lasting resolution. The Chinese spokesperson claims Beijing has strictly upheld agreements, citing steps to cancel tariffs, while U.S. officials indicate trade talks are stalled, necessitating direct leader engagement.</p>
