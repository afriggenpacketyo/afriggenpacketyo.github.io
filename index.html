          <h2>Wimbledon Match Disrupted by Electronic Line-Calling System Failure</h2>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal experienced a significant disruption when the electronic line-calling system failed at a crucial moment. The system did not register an out-ball from Kartal, leading the umpire to replay the point, which Pavlyuchenkova argued cost her the game. Despite eventually winning the match, she criticized the incident, suggesting the chair umpire should have overruled the technology and that video reviews, similar to those in football, should be implemented in tennis to prevent such errors. The All England Club attributed the malfunction to operator error but confirmed the umpire followed established protocol.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the 'America Party,' following a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a major tax and spending bill. Musk, who previously led a government efficiency task force for Trump, heavily criticized the bill for increasing the national deficit. The move was met with skepticism from Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who suggested Musk should focus on his businesses rather than politics. The article details the escalating feud, including Musk's social media posts accusing the current system of being a 'uniparty' and his renewed references to Jeffrey Epstein's associates.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie secured a place in the Wimbledon quarter-finals after a grueling five-set victory over Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry. Norrie initially led by two sets and held a match point in the third, but Jarry mounted a strong comeback, pushing the match to a decisive fifth set. Displaying his characteristic endurance, Norrie ultimately triumphed in the four-hour and 27-minute battle on Court One. The victory keeps British hopes alive in the singles tournament and was marked by a tense post-match exchange at the net, which Norrie attributed to his own vocal energy during the competitive contest.</p>

          <p>This article from Fox News reports that the father of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a Columbia University professor, made controversial historical claims during a 2022 panel discussion. Professor Mahmood Mamdani asserted that Adolf Hitler was inspired by Abraham Lincoln's creation of reservations for Native Americans and that Nazi Germany's Nuremberg Laws were patterned after American laws. The article connects these statements to the candidate's own radical political views, including his advocacy for seizing the means of production and de-commodifying housing. It presents these details as a point of concern regarding how his upbringing could influence his potential governance of the city.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's economic policies, focused on deregulation and corporate tax incentives, will undermine revitalization efforts in Rust Belt cities like Flint, Michigan. The author, a public health researcher from Flint, contends that these policies ignore the deep-seated social and environmental damage that requires targeted investment, not just broad economic stimulus. Citing the Flint water crisis as an example of failed austerity, the article warns that rollbacks of environmental protections and cuts to public health and education funding will exacerbate existing inequities, regardless of whether tariffs succeed in bringing back manufacturing jobs.

          <p>In an unprecedented move, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) will summon all 54,000 eligible ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men for military service, aiming to fully process them by July 2026. This massive conscription effort follows intense pressure from the High Court of Justice and the public to widen the draft amid the ongoing war and personnel shortages. The IDF is preparing for significant draft evasion and has allocated hundreds of jail spots for dodgers, planning to use checkpoints and airports for arrests.

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which saw rainfall totals expected only once in a thousand years, are highlighting the limitations of weather forecasting in an era of climate change. While the National Weather Service issued a series of watches and warnings, the ultimate intensity of the downpour far exceeded initial predictions, raising questions about the technology's ability to pinpoint the location and severity of such extreme events. The article notes that staffing shortages and funding cuts at forecasting agencies may have complicated the response, illustrating the compound nature of a tragedy made more frequent by a warming climate and enhanced by record warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

The community and school staff joined the families in their call for accountability and a thorough investigation to bring closure.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men to South Sudan, a country grappling with instability, after a prolonged legal battle that culminated in a Supreme Court decision. The men, convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were flown out after the court overturned a lower judge's ruling that had required due process hearings for deportations to third countries. Only one of the eight men is a South Sudanese national; the others are from countries that refused to accept them. The move represents a victory for the Trump administration's policy of expanding deportations to third-party nations, despite humanitarian concerns about sending individuals to conflict zones.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the significant political risks Republicans face after passing a domestic megabill with over $1 trillion in healthcare cuts, particularly to Medicaid. Vulnerable GOP members, including some who retired or opposed the bill, warn the move could alienate voters and cost the party its congressional majority, drawing parallels to the backlash Democrats faced over the Affordable Care Act. As Republicans strategize on how to defend the unpopular provisions, Democrats are already launching campaign ads and messaging that frame the cuts as a direct threat to their constituents' health and financial security, making it a central issue for the upcoming midterms.

While officials describe it as an enforcement date rather than a new deadline, it effectively gives trading partners more time to negotiate.

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) and Germany's ambassador to Israel have condemned an attack on a DW correspondent and cameraman by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The journalists, who were clearly identified as press, were covering a planned protest against settler violence when they were chased and had stones thrown at them. While the DW team escaped unharmed, their vehicle was badly damaged. The incident, which also forced journalists from other international outlets to flee, has prompted calls for the Israeli government to ensure the safety of media professionals and uphold freedom of the press in the region.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have suggested that China's military needs to undergo structural changes to effectively counter modern drone threats. The article proposes the likely establishment of specialized counter-drone combat units capable of rapid responses, addressing the inefficiencies of traditional units with multiple tasks. This shift is seen as a long-term goal, with more immediate adjustments focusing on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing electronic warfare units. The discussion reflects the growing importance of unmanned aircraft in modern conflicts like the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has spoken out against efforts by the White House and some in Congress to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In a recent interview, Burns called the move 'shortsighted' and 'misguided,' pushing back against the perception that public media is a left-wing entity. He argued that PBS is a crucial 'bottom-up' institution that primarily serves rural areas with essential programming beyond his own films, including education and emergency information. Burns stated that the unique, long-term production model supported by PBS has been essential for creating his acclaimed historical documentaries.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are facing a critical week as they race to secure a trade deal with Washington before President Trump's July 9 deadline, after which he has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 50% on EU imports. With only two agreements secured globally, uncertainty is high, and a split is emerging within the EU on whether to accept any deal to avoid a trade war or hold out for better terms. Brussels is now aiming for a 'framework deal,' similar to the one struck by the UK, which would likely still leave a baseline 10% tariff in place, a significant increase from pre-Trump levels.
