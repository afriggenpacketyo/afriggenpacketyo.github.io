          <p>A Florida woman, Carmen Valdez De Miguel, was arrested for allegedly defrauding a man out of thousands of dollars through a tarot card reading and spiritual cleansing scam. The scheme began when the man responded to a flyer and paid for a reading, during which Valdez De Miguel convinced him he needed a deeper cleansing costing hundreds more. She then allegedly asked him to bring $3,000, promising to double it, but instead claimed the money was lost in a ritual involving broken eggs and worms. Authorities discovered Valdez De Miguel had multiple warrants for theft and resisted arrest using a false name. </p>

          <p>Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of at least 32 people, predominantly women and children, according to local health officials. The strikes, which hit residential areas in Khan Younis and Gaza City, occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to meet with Donald Trump to discuss the war. The conflict, renewed after a ceasefire with Hamas ended, has led to widespread anti-war protests within Gaza and calls from hostage families in Israel for a resolution. The strikes have also exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the UN reporting critical shortages of food and aid.</p>

Judge Paula Xinis pressed him on the authority under which law enforcement seized Abrego Garcia, leading Reuveni to express his own frustration at the lack of answers.

          <p>Senior officials in the Trump administration offered conflicting statements regarding the newly imposed global tariffs, causing further market turmoil. While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted the tariffs were here to stay as part of a plan to "reset global trade", Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins suggested negotiations with individual countries were still possible. The tariffs have triggered warnings of a potential global recession and criticism from within the Republican party, with concerns raised about the impact on US consumers and businesses. Democrats are seizing on the issue, warning of a potential "Trump recession."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' decision to accept an invitation to visit the White House under President Trump has drawn criticism, with some viewing it as a betrayal of the team's values. The visit, scheduled shortly before Jackie Robinson Day, is seen by some as hypocritical given Trump's history of xenophobia and policies targeting diversity. While the team's president, Stan Kasten, argues the visit is simply a reward for winning the World Series and not a political statement, critics contend that normalizing Trump's rhetoric is inherently political.

          <p>Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins defended President Trump's tariffs, including those imposed on uninhabited islands like Heard and McDonald Islands, which are populated by penguins. When questioned about the rationale behind the tariffs on these islands, Rollins responded with "I mean, come on, whatever". She argued that the administration is serious, intentional, and patriotic in its approach to trade. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added that no country could be left off the list to prevent others from shipping through them to avoid tariffs.</p>

          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's preference for freshly baked cookies has reportedly led to unusual requests within the Department of Interior. His chief of staff allegedly asked political appointees to regularly bake cookies for Burgum and his guests. Other concerns include using political appointees as servers and using a U.S. Park Police helicopter for personal transportation. Department officials have dismissed these claims, stating the cookies are part of hospitality and the helicopter trip was arranged by security.</p>

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and halting future visa issuances due to South Sudan's failure to comply with US repatriation efforts. The State Department stated that South Sudan was "taking advantage of the United States" by not accepting the return of its citizens. The move affects all visa appointments and existing visas, effectively barring South Sudanese citizens from entering the US. This is the first time the Trump administration has targeted a group by citizenship with such a measure.</p>
