          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza, humanitarian organizations warn that it is insufficient to prevent famine. Although nearly 200 trucks carrying aid have crossed through the Kerem Shalom crossing, critics argue this is a "drop in the ocean" compared to the 600 trucks that entered daily during a previous ceasefire. Supplies are delayed due to security clearances and logistical challenges, with a massive buffer zone created behind the border where aid trucks queue. The UN criticizes Israel's plan to use private US security firms for aid distribution, emphasizing that existing networks are already in place.</p>

          <p>The UK government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, originally due in the spring, until the autumn. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Liz Kendall and Bridget Phillipson, is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Critics have condemned the delay, with the SNP calling it "disgraceful," while Save the Children UK warns that thousands of children are plunged into poverty each month the cap remains. A government spokesperson stated that an ambitious child poverty strategy would be published later in the year to ensure fully-funded measures address the root causes of child poverty.</p>

          <p>More and more Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting" their jobs, prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by the Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with young employees leading the trend. This shift is driven by a desire for more personal time and a rejection of the long hours and sacrifices made by previous generations. Experts suggest that changing company practices and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic have also contributed to this new attitude towards work.</p>

Several Palestinians and soldiers have testified to this practice, which is prohibited by international law. The Israeli military denies these allegations, stating that it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields and is investigating reported cases. Rights groups, however, claim that the practice has become increasingly common during the ongoing conflict, pointing to a systemic failure and moral collapse.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the win highlighted concerns about the team's pitching depth. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was stretched thin, with nearly every reliever being used. Despite holding a lead, closer Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth inning, forcing the game into extra innings. Teoscar Hernández ultimately drove in the go-ahead run in the 13th, but the game's length could have future consequences for the Dodgers' already taxed pitching staff.</p>

Experts suggest Taiwan's diminishing presence in Africa reflects a deepening alignment between African nations and China, driven by strong economic relations. This shift underscores Beijing's increasing influence on the continent and the reluctance of African states to offend China by giving Taiwan prominence.</p>

Koizumi is also exploring online sales to broaden distribution, engaging with Rakuten Group for potential collaboration.

          <p>Germany's self-proclaimed policy of acknowledging its past crimes is often selective and contradictory, embraced when it flatters its self-image and ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. Despite a national narrative of confronting the Nazi past, Germany continues to award a prestigious journalism prize named after Herbert Quandt, a Nazi collaborator who used slave labor. Streets still bear the names of colonial administrators responsible for genocide, and the government avoids paying reparations to victims of colonial violence. This selective amnesia undermines Germany's "never again" promise.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be opened across England over the next decade to reduce crowding in accident and emergency departments (A&E).

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited controversy. Despite a recent pause on automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., a private organization running facial recognition cameras, police used the technology to recapture one fugitive. Critics, including the ACLU, raise concerns about privacy and constitutional rights, calling for a halt to live-feed facial recognition. Republicans in Congress have also expressed opposition to unchecked use of the technology. The debate highlights the tension between public safety and civil liberties.</p>
