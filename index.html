          <h2>Colorado Man Receives Life Sentence for Fatal DUI Crash</h2>

          <p>A Colorado man, Paul Stephenson, 57, received a life sentence plus 92 years for a drunk driving incident in August 2024 that tragically killed Air Force Lt. Col. Matt Anderson and injured his four children. Stephenson, who had a blood alcohol level 2.5 times the legal limit, admitted to consuming a bottle of whiskey and two beers before driving, leading to his conviction for first-degree murder, his third DUI offense. District Attorney George Brauchler stated the severe sentence aimed to deter drunk driving in Douglas County, calling it a "bitter coincidence" that justice was served the day before July Fourth. Anderson's father expressed that the verdict provided their family with a small amount of closure after this devastating event.</p>

          <p>Despite hopes for a recovery in European factory activity, highlighted by a 34-month high in Germany's manufacturing index, the sector remains in contraction. This underscores the challenge Germany faces in regaining manufacturing growth. Analysts suggest that while China and Europe seek closer ties, a key dynamic is Europe's concern over China's potential threat to its manufacturing prowess, a vital economic sector. The EU, with a US$2.72 trillion output in 2024, aims to rebuild its manufacturing base, making cheap imports from China a significant concern. This article highlights the complex balance between fostering warmer relations and safeguarding core economic interests.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Condemn Trump's Budget Bill as a 'Dark Day' for the Nation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 04:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats have expressed intense outrage following the narrow passage of Donald Trump’s budget bill, signaling their strategy for next year’s midterm elections. Party leaders, including DNC Chair Ken Martin, assert the bill disproportionately benefits billionaires while harming working-class Americans through cuts to Medicaid, Affordable Care Act subsidies, and SNAP food assistance. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez highlighted the bill's contradictions, noting permanent tax breaks for the wealthy alongside expiring benefits for low-income earners and a significant expansion of ICE funding. Critics from both sides, including budget hawks, also raised concerns about the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critically examines the passage of Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill, arguing it became law despite broad unpopularity and devastating projected impacts on Americans. The author details how Republican senators, including self-proclaimed fiscal conservatives, ultimately supported the bill after creative accounting or political pressure from Trump. The legislation is expected to cause 17 million Americans to lose health coverage, cut food assistance, reverse green energy investments, and lead to Medicare cuts due to a projected $3.3 trillion deficit increase. The article concludes that the bill disproportionately benefits billionaires and expands ICE, warning of severe societal consequences.</p>

          <p>An unidentified North Korean man successfully crossed the heavily fortified land border into South Korea and is now in South Korean custody. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff identified and tracked the individual near the central-west section of the military demarcation line, conducting a "guiding operation" before taking him into custody. Authorities are investigating the border crossing, but have not yet confirmed if it was a defection attempt. This incident comes amid recent flare-ups in border tensions, including North Korea sending trash-filled balloons and South Korea resuming propaganda broadcasts, though South Korea's new liberal president has sought to rebuild trust.</p>

While Jane Street disputes the findings and intends to engage with the regulator, SEBI asserts the firm's actions, especially after a prior advisory, demonstrate a disregard for market integrity.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 27.7% to 34.9% on imported brandy from the European Union, effective Saturday. This move escalates trade tensions between Beijing and Brussels, coming just before the July 5 deadline for China's anti-dumping investigation and ahead of a planned China-EU summit. The ministry stated that the domestic brandy industry faces a "material threat of injury" due to EU dumping, with exporters agreeing to a minimum price exempt from duties. This action follows the EU's own investigations into Chinese subsidies and reflects a complex, protective trade relationship.</p>

The report also highlighted "widespread evidence of workers suffering debt bondage, working excessive hours and exploitative conditions," accusing the Home Office of being slow and ineffective in tackling exploitation.

Furthermore, the company's increasing overseas sales, especially in Southeast Asia and North America, are expected to account for over half of its projected revenue in 2025, further cushioning any domestic regulatory impact and supporting its "dopamine economy" appeal.</p>

          <p>In an interview marking his first year as prime minister, Keir Starmer reflected on a tumultuous period, defending his numerous policy "U-turns" as common sense and pragmatism rather than weakness. Despite recent controversies, including a costly climbdown on welfare reforms that lost £5bn in planned savings and caused market fluctuations, Starmer highlighted achievements in the NHS, schools, and securing three trade deals. He acknowledged process issues with welfare reforms but took responsibility, asserting that the government would "come through this stronger." The article delves into his personal approach to leadership, contrasting it with ideological thinking.</p>

Two people were injured, but no fatalities have been confirmed yet. Investigations are ongoing, with federal and local agencies, including the ATF, involved. Family members have identified some of the missing, including an 18-year-old on his first day of work, as authorities use drones to navigate the hazardous scene.</p>

This advanced implant system differs from traditional hearing aids by directly stimulating the auditory nerve with electrical signals from an external processor equipped with a noise-cancelling microphone, bypassing damaged hair cells in the inner ear. Chief Technology Officer Jan Janssen stated that the implant is particularly beneficial for users experiencing severe and profound hearing loss, for whom conventional hearing aids are no longer effective.</p>

McLemore's attorney claimed consensual sex, but the victim testified she froze in terror upon waking during the assault, stating she didn't know who was assaulting her.
