          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 04:53:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba voiced his disappointment following the implementation of the U.S. auto part tariff. The U.S. administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on key auto parts, including engines, impacting Japan's car industry. This action follows similar tariffs on automobiles, potentially affecting Japan's economy, as the auto industry is a major export sector. The tariffs are part of a broader effort by the U.S. to reduce trade deficits and address perceived unfair trade practices, causing concern among Japanese officials regarding the economic impact on their nation.

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has launched legal action against Ofsted, the UK's education watchdog, over proposed changes to school inspections. The union seeks a judicial review of plans for new school report cards, arguing they represent a crude grading system. This action follows concerns raised after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, whose sister called for delaying the new system. Ofsted defends the proposals, emphasizing their support for mental health, but the NAHT insists the changes are insufficient and detrimental to school leaders' well-being.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, has injured nearly 50 people, including a child, as seventeen drones targeted civilian infrastructure and residential areas. The attack caused fires and damaged homes and buildings across four districts of the city. This incident follows another recent attack on Zaporizhzhia, which injured 29 people, intensifying concerns over civilian safety. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, asserting they targeted homes rather than military sites, and renewed calls for stronger international pressure on Russia to enforce a ceasefire and end the war.</p>

The case highlights concerns about the private prosecution system for fare evasion, especially after previous scandals involving wrongful convictions.

          <p>Ghana's ambitious plan for a national cathedral, designed by architect David Adjaye, has stalled due to economic distress and allegations of corruption. Former President Nana Akufo-Addo's $400 million project, intended as a national monument, has only resulted in a large, excavated hole after spending $58 million in public funds. The project, now a target of the new government's anticorruption initiative, has faced criticism for its financial implications and lack of transparency. The unbuilt cathedral has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and a political battleground, with the new government halting funding and dissolving the managing agency.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Ukraine will be unable to supplant China as a top supplier of critical minerals for the U.S., despite a recent minerals deal with Washington. Most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are in Russian-occupied territories, and extracting and processing the remaining resources would take years due to limited capacity. China controls a majority of the world's rare earth element reserves and refining processes, dwarfing Ukraine's potential output. While the deal signals continued U.S. support for Ukraine, it does little to alleviate American reliance on China for these vital materials.</p>

          <p>A UK government impact assessment suggests that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths annually within a decade of legalization in England and Wales, if MPs vote in favor. The assessment estimates initial low numbers, growing over time, but still representing less than 1% of all deaths. It also analyzes potential NHS savings from reduced care costs, ranging from £919,000 to £10.3m in the first six months, and up to £59.6m after ten years. However, it also acknowledges significant costs, including staffing and training, making it difficult to determine overall financial impact.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. The antivenom cocktail, tested on mice, showed significant protection against deadly neurotoxins. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, leading to the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies. The research is a significant step towards creating a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year.</p>

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and mainland China. The museum, home to treasures from Beijing's Imperial Palace, saw a significant decrease in tourists from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. While the museum aims to attract 3.5 million visitors in its centenary year, challenges persist due to political factors and tourism policy changes. The museum is focusing on attracting visitors from other regions, with South Korea and Japan being key sources of tourism.</p>

          <p>Ryan Garcia's defeat to Rolando Romero has disrupted plans for a rematch with Devin Haney. Garcia's performance was lackluster, leading to a unanimous decision victory for Romero.

Romero's victory has opened new possibilities in the welterweight division, while Garcia expressed disappointment with his performance. The outcome has cast doubt on the potential Haney-Garcia rematch, leaving the future of both fighters uncertain.</p>

The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US. Analysts said any immediate expansions in the US were likely to come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for the businesses - and ultimately higher prices for customers.</p>
