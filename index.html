          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, injuring nineteen people. The incident occurred on Saturday evening as the ship was departing for Iceland. Mayor Eric Adams reported that four individuals sustained serious injuries, and authorities temporarily closed the bridge to traffic. According to the Mexican navy, the ship sustained damage during a sailing maneuver, prompting a review by naval and local authorities. The Mexican ambassador to the U.S. noted that the ship has been sailing for about 20 years and that the incident may have been caused by mechanical issues with the pilot assigned to navigate the vessel.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for answers in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators initially compared the footprints to multiple suspects, including Arthur Gray, who lived with Childs at the time, but he had a solid alibi. In 2015, forensic scientist Andrea Feia discovered an unknown DNA profile throughout the crime scene. This led investigators to Jerry Westrom, who was eventually arrested in 2019 after his DNA matched the unknown profile, and his footprints were also confirmed to match those found at the scene.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, asserting that the company should absorb the costs. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that Walmart made billions of dollars and could afford to "EAT THE TARIFFS" to keep prices down for consumers. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible despite the pressure from tariffs. This exchange occurred amidst concerns that Trump's trade policy could lead to inflation, with retailers facing the choice of raising prices or laying off workers.</p>

Major U.S. companies negotiated deals directly with Gulf country leaders, sometimes diverging from the Biden administration's policies on technology sales.

          <p>A local government in China has detailed the punishment dealt to a young man, surnamed Liu, who refused to serve in the military due to personal preference. Despite voluntarily signing up in January, Liu repeatedly requested to leave after being assigned to an armed police force in March. As a result, he is now banned from civil service and state-owned enterprises, must pay a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300), and faces travel and business restrictions for two years. The penalties aim to uphold the importance of military service and deter others from shirking their duties.</p>

          <p>A rare and powerful dust storm swept across the Midwest, turning daylight into near-total darkness and prompting warnings from the National Weather Service. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, caused extremely low visibility and hazardous driving conditions. The phenomenon, known as a haboob, was attributed to unusually dry soil conditions and strong winds. The event serves as a reminder of the potential for extreme weather events in the region and the importance of preparedness.</p>
