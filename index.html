          <p>Reality television personality Kris Jenner, 69, has publicly confirmed undergoing a second facelift, explaining the procedure as her personal approach to "aging gracefully." In an interview with Vogue Arabia, she expressed a desire to be the best version of herself and shared that being transparent about her cosmetic surgeries can be inspirational for others. Jenner noted that her daughters, Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian, were supportive throughout the process, with one present in person and the other via video call. She emphasized that she feels great at her age and has no plans to retire from managing her family's extensive business empire.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is facing criticism for not performing its own cost-benefit analysis before proceeding with a major reorganization of local councils in England. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner had claimed the mergers could save "a significant amount of money," basing estimates on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since updated its analysis, suggesting the reorganization might not yield any savings and could even incur additional costs under certain scenarios. Critics, including the District Councils' Network, have called the lack of independent government analysis "astonishing" for such a large-scale reform.</p>

          <p>A major Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in the deaths of at least 23 people, including four children, and left dozens more injured. The bombardment destroyed a five-story residential building and caused significant damage to the nearby European Union delegation office and the British Council. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed outrage, stating the strikes were a grim reminder of Russia's willingness to terrorize Ukraine's civilian population. The attack, one of the deadliest on the capital in months, has been widely condemned by European and US officials as a deliberate escalation amid peace efforts.</p>

Fletcher's father described the attacker as a "coward" and remembered his son's love for family, friends, and sports. The family of Harper Moyski expressed their devastation and urged leaders to take meaningful action to address gun violence and the nation's mental health crisis. Both families thanked first responders and the community for their support while asking for privacy as they grieve their profound loss.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law, set to take effect on September 1, will restrict individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing or renting property in the state. Proponents, including Governor Greg Abbott, argue the measure is necessary for national security, citing concerns over foreign adversaries acquiring land near critical infrastructure. However, opponents, including community activists and the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance, condemn the law as discriminatory and xenophobic, drawing parallels to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.

With EV prices declining due to softer demand, leasing has become the most popular way for consumers to adopt the technology, accounting for 70% of transactions in July.

Since President Trump dismissed most of the panel's members and has not named replacements, Lake lacks the legal authority to terminate the director.

          <h2>Longstanding 'De Minimis' Rule Ends, Subjecting Low-Value Imports to US Taxes</h2>

          <p>A nearly 90-year-old trade rule known as "de minimis," which allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. duty-free, is being suspended by an executive order from President Trump. Previously, goods valued under $800 were exempt from import taxes, a loophole that greatly benefited online retailers like Temu and Shein that ship cheap goods from overseas. Starting Friday, all incoming shipments will face an import tax for the next six months, after which tariffs will be based on the country of origin. This change is expected to increase prices for American consumers on many inexpensive imported items they are accustomed to buying online.</p>

          <h2>Rural Public Media Stations Face Uncertainty Over Emergency-Alert System Funding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 17:26:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public media stations in rural America are warning that crucial funding for the nation's emergency alert system is now in jeopardy. The Next Generation Warning System grant program, created by Congress to help stations in rural and tribal areas upgrade their equipment, has been plagued by delays and stop-work orders. The situation worsened after Congress rescinded federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which had been administering the grants. Stations that were previously awarded funds are now unsure if they will be reimbursed for investments, leaving communities reliant on aging infrastructure as extreme weather risks grow.</p>

          <p>All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers following a lengthy and public contract dispute. As part of the deal, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history with $136 million guaranteed. The Cowboys will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark in return. The trade ends a standoff between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who had refused to negotiate with the player's agent, leading Parsons to formally request a trade earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>Shares of Gap Inc. fell in after-hours trading after the retailer reported mixed second-quarter results and issued a warning that increased tariffs will negatively affect its future profits. The company raised its estimate for the financial impact of tariffs and lowered its full-year operating margin forecast. While sales were nearly flat year-over-year, they fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, and comparable sales growth at its Athleta brand was down 9%. Despite the challenges, the company reaffirmed its overall annual sales growth outlook, citing momentum at its Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom announced that special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams will be expanded to work with local law enforcement in major cities across the state, including Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Bay Area. While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom stated the new deployments would be targeted and data-driven to address specific local challenges. The announcement comes amid criticism from President Trump about crime in blue states. Newsom contrasted his collaborative approach with local officials against what he termed the president's strategy of "militarizing American cities" without local partnership.</p>

          <p>The recent upheaval at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the firing of its director and multiple high-level resignations, stems from a fundamental conflict over vaccine policy and scientific independence. The turmoil is largely driven by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, who has overhauled a key vaccine advisory panel and pushed for changes to immunization schedules. Resigning officials have expressed alarm, stating that policy is being driven by a political agenda that disregards scientific reality, potentially undermining public trust and weakening the nation's ability to respond to health crises.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), was abruptly fired by the Trump administration on Wednesday. Primus stated he discovered his termination when his work phone was locked after he returned from an Amtrak event unveiling new Acela trains. No cause was given for the dismissal, which comes as the board is reviewing a major proposed merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. Rail worker unions condemned the move, suggesting Primus was removed due to his opposition to the merger, calling it an "assault on the independence of federal oversight."</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump to prevent her removal from the central bank's board. Trump announced he was firing Cook "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud that she committed before joining the board. Cook's lawsuit argues the justification is a "nakedly pretextual" and illegal attempt to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, as the law requires a high standard for removing a governor. The unprecedented legal challenge, which names Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a co-defendant, will now be heard by a federal judge, with the outcome likely to have significant implications for the central bank.</p>
