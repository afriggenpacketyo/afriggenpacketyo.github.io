          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred a decision on President Trump's emergency request to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position for now. The court will hear arguments in January regarding the unprecedented attempt to remove a sitting Fed governor, a case that tests the president's authority over the historically independent central bank. Cook's lawyers argue her removal would politicize the Fed and destabilize financial markets, while the administration cites alleged mortgage misrepresentations from before her appointment as sufficient cause for her dismissal.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order classifying any armed attack on Qatar as a threat to the peace and security of the United States, promising a diplomatic, economic, or military response. This move follows an Israeli bombing in Doha on September 9th, which targeted Hamas leaders but also killed a Qatari serviceman and violated the nation's sovereignty. In a subsequent trilateral call, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the strike, which occurred while he was in Washington discussing a Gaza ceasefire proposal with the president.</p>

          <p>British toymaker Jellycat, popular with Gen Z, more than doubled its pre-tax profit to £139 million in 2024, driven by a surge in demand from "kidults." The company's revenue grew by 66% to £333 million as more adults purchase soft toys for comfort amid global instability, a trend reflecting a broader rise in the "joy economy." This growth is visible on platforms like TikTok, where the brand has millions of followers, and aligns with industry research showing adults are now the biggest spenders in the U.S. toy market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive campaign against "sanctuary" cities and states that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement has yielded few tangible results after eight months. Despite lawsuits, threats of funding cuts, and surges in deportation agents, most targeted jurisdictions have maintained their policies, with legal challenges often blocking the administration's actions. While one city in Kentucky and the state of Nevada have altered their stances, the broader effort has largely stalled in the courts, highlighting the ongoing legal and political clash over immigration enforcement and states' rights.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, stated the company's long-term goal is to primarily use its own custom-designed chips in its AI data centers, reducing its reliance on major suppliers like Nvidia. While currently using chips that offer the best price-performance, which has historically been Nvidia, Microsoft has been developing its own silicon, such as the Azure Maia AI Accelerator and Cobalt CPU. This strategy is part of a broader plan to design and optimize the entire data center system, including networking and cooling, for specific AI workloads.</p>

          <h2>Hidden Crisis of Sexual Violence Against Boys in India Gains Attention</h2>

          <p>A recent case in Kerala, where a 16-year-old boy was allegedly sexually assaulted by 14 men, has highlighted the under-discussed issue of sexual violence against boys in India. Experts and survivors note that the topic remains taboo due to societal pressures and traditional notions of masculinity that portray men as strong and not as victims, leading to shame and silence. This cultural stigma often results in male survivors being disbelieved or dismissed, despite studies suggesting the problem is widespread, prompting calls for stronger enforcement of gender-neutral child protection laws.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has closed its final two clinics in Louisiana, located in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, citing compounding political attacks and challenges to their operational feasibility. The closures were precipitated by a recent court ruling that allowed the implementation of a provision in a Trump administration spending bill, which blocks the clinics from accepting Medicaid reimbursements. Though these specific clinics had not provided abortion services in their 40-year history, they offered essential care such as STI testing and family planning to thousands of patients, leaving a significant gap in the region's public health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A major Nigerian oil workers' union, PENGASSAN, has ended its two-day strike at the Dangote refinery, Africa's largest, following a meeting with company management and government officials.

The agreement involves Dangote starting the process of reassigning the dismissed staff to other companies within its group without any loss of pay, resolving the immediate labor conflict.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown is the 15th time federal funding has lapsed since 1980, when a new legal interpretation required agencies to cease operations during funding gaps. Before then, agencies often continued to run with the assumption that funding would be quickly restored. Shutdowns became a more frequent tool of political leverage over the past decade, with the longest one occurring in 2018-2019 for 34 days over a dispute about border wall funding, which caused an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses and impacted hundreds of thousands of federal workers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has shut down because Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the October 1st deadline, stemming from a partisan impasse. House Republicans passed a short-term funding extension, but Senate Democrats refused to support it without negotiations to make enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits permanent. With Republicans controlling both chambers but needing 60 votes in the Senate, Democratic support is essential, yet neither side has been willing to concede, leading to the lapse in appropriations and the furloughing of hundreds of thousands of federal workers.</p>

          <p>While hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have their paychecks delayed due to the government shutdown, members of Congress and the president will continue to be paid. Lawmakers' salaries are mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation, making them exempt from the annual funding lapse that affects federal agencies. Similarly, the president's salary cannot be reduced while in office. In contrast, both essential and furloughed federal workers will not receive their pay until after the shutdown ends and Congress approves back pay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its official homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, a move that an ethics watchdog group has called a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act. The group, Public Citizen, filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, arguing that the highly partisan message uses taxpayer-funded resources for political purposes. The Hatch Act limits the political activities of federal employees to ensure government programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion.</p>

          <p>While air travel is not expected to be immediately impacted by the government shutdown, a prolonged impasse could lead to significant disruptions for passengers. Most TSA officers and air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay, but extended shutdowns in the past have led to increased sick calls and staff shortages, causing longer security lines and flight delays. A prolonged shutdown could also halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage, and could cost the U.S. travel economy an estimated $1 billion per week.</p>

          <p>With the government shutdown in effect, all active-duty U.S. military service members are required to continue performing their duties but will not receive their paychecks on time. Their pay will be delayed until after the shutdown ends, unless Congress passes specific legislation to fund it, which has not yet occurred. Many essential civilian Defense Department employees will also work without pay, while others will be furloughed. To mitigate the financial hardship, some financial institutions that serve military members are offering no-interest loans.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans who receive Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly payments during the government shutdown, as the program is covered by mandatory spending and does not rely on annual appropriations.

According to the SSA's contingency plan, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards will be halted, and there may be delays in processing new applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has attributed the rise in small boat arrivals to Brexit, arguing that leaving the EU ended a key returns agreement. Before the 2016 referendum, the UK utilized the Dublin III regulation to return more asylum seekers to EU countries than it received, though the numbers were small. Since formally exiting the agreement, the UK has lacked a broad mechanism for returns, which migration experts say has made the UK a more attractive destination for migrants. Critics, however, dispute this connection, pointing to other factors.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have benched veteran quarterback Joe Flacco and will start rookie Dillon Gabriel for their upcoming game against the Minnesota Vikings in London. The decision comes after the team's 1-3 start, with an offense that ranks near the bottom of the league in scoring. Gabriel, a third-round draft pick, has completed all three of his passes in limited action this season and showed promise during the preseason. The move also brings renewed attention to fifth-round pick Shedeur Sanders, who remains the third-string quarterback despite significant draft-day buzz.</p>
