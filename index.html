        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the company of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. The complaint alleges that Uber discriminates by refusing service to individuals with service animals or stowable wheelchairs and by imposing improper surcharges on them. The federal government is seeking a jury trial, monetary damages, and a civil fine against the ride-hailing service. Uber has disputed the allegations, stating that its policies prohibit discrimination and that it has implemented features to improve the experience for riders with service animals.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that most federal tax expenditures, such as the mortgage-interest deduction and education credits, are costly and fail to achieve their intended goals. Citing a new study, the author contends that these tax breaks often benefit specific political constituencies and distort economic decisions without being cost-effective. While some provisions for retirement savings are shown to be effective, many others are described as wasteful subsidies. The author advocates for eliminating ineffective tax expenditures to simplify the tax code and address the rising national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kodak has found surprising success with its latest product, a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras called the "Kodak Charmera." The palm-sized cameras, which come in blind box packaging and feature vintage-style photo filters, sold out quickly on Kodak's website. This success taps into Gen Z's growing interest in retro technology and Y2K aesthetics, a trend dubbed "analog wellness." The strong sales provide a much-needed boost for the legacy photography company, which has recently faced significant financial struggles.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as the UK's ambassador to the United States following the release of new emails detailing his supportive messages to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2008. The emails, which showed Mandelson encouraging Epstein as he faced charges, were described as "reprehensible" by the Prime Minister's office. The sacking has sparked political criticism over Mandelson's initial appointment. The dismissal comes at a sensitive time, just a week before a scheduled state visit to the UK by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump expressed his belief that "the country will heal." In a call with CNBC, Trump described himself as "devastated" by the death of Kirk, whom he credited with helping him win the 2024 election and viewed as a potential future president. The president stated that his focus remains on winning and helping the country, which he believes will enable Americans to come together again. Kirk, a prominent Trump ally, was fatally shot while speaking at an event in Utah.</p>

          <p>A California bill aiming to ban PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in products like nonstick cookware has created a conflict between environmental advocates and a group of celebrity chefs. The legislation would phase out the use of these persistent chemicals, which are linked to negative health effects, in various consumer goods. Environmental groups and actor Mark Ruffalo support the ban, citing risks of PFAS particles being released from pans. However, an alliance of chefs, including Rachael Ray, argues that the nonstick coatings are safe when used correctly and that a ban could make home cooking more expensive.</p>

          <p>The White House made a last-minute decision to move the annual 9/11 commemoration ceremony at the Pentagon into an interior courtyard, a departure from its traditional location at the 9/11 memorial.

          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has stated that offshore wind power has no future in the U.S. under the Trump administration, citing high costs and unreliability. Speaking at an energy conference, Burgum confirmed the administration's intent to halt the industry, which was already impacted by an executive order barring new leases. He also revealed that the Department of the Interior is closely reviewing five offshore wind projects that are already under construction. This policy represents a significant reversal from previous efforts to develop renewable energy sources.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece uses the assassination of Charlie Kirk to explore the escalating cycle of political violence in the United States. The author contrasts calls for de-escalation with the inflammatory rhetoric from some who have declared "war" on their political opponents in the wake of the killing. The article reflects on whether the comforts of a stable society are enough to prevent a descent into widespread conflict, a concept described as the "strawberries in winter" theory. It argues that while most Americans likely do not want civil war, the current environment makes further violence dangerously possible.</p>

          <p>Belarus has released 52 political prisoners as part of an agreement with the U.S. government to secure the easing of some economic sanctions. The deal allows the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts, while prominent activists, journalists, and trade union leaders have been freed. The release was described by authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko as a humanitarian gesture. This development comes as Belarus and Russia begin joint military exercises, which have heightened regional tensions and led neighboring Poland to close its border for security reasons.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving forward with a controversial rule change, known as the "nuclear option," to speed up the confirmation of President Trump's sub-cabinet level nominees. The change allows for nominees to be considered in groups and lowers the voting threshold to a simple majority, bypassing Democratic efforts to slow the process. Democrats have warned that the move will erode the Senate's deliberative nature and could be regretted in the future. The action follows months of partisan gridlock over confirmations, with Republicans arguing the change is necessary to staff the administration effectively.</p>

          <p>A recent government inflation report indicates that President Trump's tariffs are contributing to rising costs for American consumers on a range of everyday goods. Prices for tariff-sensitive items like apparel, electronics, auto parts, and groceries all saw increases in August. The data shows that goods excluding food and energy are rising at their fastest rate since May 2023. While the administration has maintained that tariffs will not drive inflation, economists note that the price hikes are squeezing middle-class households when the labor market is also showing signs of weakness.

The official COLA will be announced in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated.
