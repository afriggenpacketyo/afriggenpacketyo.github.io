          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit argues that these policies, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities, interfere with the federal government's ability to enforce immigration law. The suit specifically mentions an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, that President Trump claimed was controlled by a Venezuelan gang due to these policies. Colorado and Denver officials have defended their policies, stating they comply with all applicable laws and prioritize community safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to eliminate the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods from mainland China and Hong Kong is expected to significantly impact online retailers like Temu and Shein. These companies, which have relied heavily on digital advertising to attract American shoppers, may face tariffs as high as 145 percent. This shift is already causing them to reduce their advertising spending on platforms like Meta and Google, potentially impacting the revenue of these tech giants. Temu has reportedly stopped shipping directly from China to the U.S., transitioning to a local fulfillment model to mitigate the tariff impact.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious plan to build a $400 million national cathedral has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. Former President Nana Akufo-Addo's pledge to construct the cathedral as a personal promise to God led to the expenditure of approximately $58 million in public funds, despite Ghana facing severe economic distress. The project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has been halted, leaving behind a large, excavated hole in Accra. The new government has ceased funding and initiated an anticorruption investigation, underscoring the project's failure to garner public support and its entanglement in political battles.</p>

To enroll, individuals have their irises scanned by a device called the Orb, receiving a unique biometric identifier and cryptocurrency called Worldcoin in exchange. The company envisions World ID as a solution to distinguish humans from AI online and potentially distribute proceeds from AI systems through a universal basic income. The project has faced scrutiny over privacy concerns and regulatory hurdles, but has also gained traction in developing countries.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, a move expected to increase the cost of new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance premiums. These tariffs, part of President Trump's plan to bolster domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars. While parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain conditions, the tariffs will likely affect vehicles made in the U.S. that rely on imported components. Automakers and suppliers express concern over the potential for increased costs, parts shortages, and business instability.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises amidst growing concerns about partisan online posts influencing election outcomes. While Japan recently enacted legislation to facilitate the removal of defamatory content, its impact has been limited. The survey also highlights divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and strong support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames and recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>

The CIA stated that these changes are intended to align the agency with President Trump's national security priorities, boost the use of human intelligence sources, and increase focus on China.

Hamel was found unconscious outside a dorm and died days later, but the events leading up to her death remain unclear. The family sought community help in identifying a man who was with Liz the night she fell, and university police have since interviewed him. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are working closely with the Santa Barbara District Attorney's Office.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in recent local elections across England, taking control of 10 councils and winning a by-election. Both Labour and the Conservatives experienced major defeats, losing control of all their previously held councils. The Liberal Democrats gained seats and control of three councils, while the Green Party doubled their number of councillors. Mayoral contests presented a mixed picture, with Labour retaining three mayors, Conservatives gaining one, and Reform UK winning two newly created mayoralties. The results indicate a potential shift in voter preferences away from the traditional main parties.</p>

          <p>Top-ranking officials in the Trump administration have criticized Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) for designating the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "right-wing extremist" entity.

US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, condemned the move, accusing Germany of stifling opposition. The German Foreign Ministry defended the decision, stating it was the result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect the constitution and prevent right-wing extremism.</p>

          <p>A fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles exposed water supply vulnerabilities, as a reservoir was offline for repairs. Despite efforts to revive an old reservoir as a temporary solution, the plan was never completed due to safety concerns. During the fire, smaller water tanks were depleted, leading to firefighters reporting dry hydrants. The city hopes to restore the main reservoir by the end of June. The water supply issues are central to legal claims from wildfire victims.</p>

China's engagement with the new Syrian government, which includes members identified as "terrorists" by the UN, presents a dilemma.
