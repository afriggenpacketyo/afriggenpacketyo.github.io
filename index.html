          <p>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The hastily arranged summit, described by the White House as a "listening exercise," follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, including a recent deadline for a ceasefire. While Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky will not be in attendance, he is expected to be briefed afterward, though he has stated any agreements made without Ukraine's input would be "dead decisions." The meeting's location in Alaska holds historical significance, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867.</p>

          <p>As the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin gets underway in Alaska, unique details surrounding the event have emerged, including a show of military force and unexpected political commentary. Ahead of the meeting, a B-2 stealth bomber and four F-35 fighter jets conducted a flyover at the military base, a display of American air power. In a surprising statement, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully ends the Ukraine war without conceding territory. The meeting's context is shaped by previous tense encounters between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is not present at the summit.</p>

          <p>A tech analyst has described potential government intervention in chipmaker Intel as "essential" for U.S. national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. The move aims to revive the struggling firm and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. Proponents argue that with the rise of superintelligent AI, domestic control over critical chip manufacturing is paramount, comparing it to the necessity of controlling production for the nation's nuclear arsenal. The intervention could be funded through the CHIPS Act, which has already provided billions to Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 16:01:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped 14% after the company issued weak financial guidance, citing uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China. The company's revenue and earnings-per-share forecasts for the upcoming quarter fell significantly short of analyst expectations. Executives attributed the downturn to macroeconomic pressures, trade issues, and a slowdown in spending from Chinese clients who had previously been ramping up manufacturing capacity. Despite the poor outlook, Applied Materials did manage to exceed earnings and revenue estimates for the most recently completed quarter, though this was overshadowed by the future guidance.

The referee, Anthony Taylor, paused the game to speak with both team managers and captains before play resumed at Anfield. Following the incident, an anti-discrimination message was broadcast to the stadium's attendees during the halftime interval.

Obama explained that while sports rivalries are normal, the current social media environment amplifies negativity, making it difficult for young athletes to withstand the constant barrage of public opinion. The discussion also touched on a recent on-court incident between Clark and Reese, which led to a WNBA investigation into alleged racist comments directed at Reese.</p>

          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally named Kisean Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for his involvement in a fraud scheme totaling over $1 million. Kingston and his mother, Janice Turner, were convicted of orchestrating a plan to acquire luxury items, including an SUV and high-end jewelry, using fake wire transfer receipts as proof of payment. The scheme was uncovered after a SWAT team raided his rented Florida mansion in May 2024. Turner was previously sentenced to five years in prison for her role in the conspiracy, and both face separate state-level fraud charges.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's injunction, potentially allowing the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to fire 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The court ruled that the initial decision to block the mass layoffs was made without proper jurisdiction, though the ruling's effect is paused to allow for a potential review. This legal battle is part of a broader effort by the administration to reshape the consumer watchdog agency, which has returned over $21 billion to consumers since its inception.

          <p>The cost of preparing a packed school lunch has risen nearly 3% over the past year, reaching an average of $6.15, according to a new report from Deloitte. This increase is attributed to broader grocery price inflation, with staples like milk and bananas seeing significant price hikes. While some items like white bread and tomatoes have become cheaper, the overall trend is putting financial pressure on families. In response, many caregivers are switching to store brands and cheaper meal options. The report also notes that cafeteria lunch prices are up 3.3%, though federal programs and free lunch offerings may offset some of the cost for families.</p>

While the company initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, the rollback of EV incentives may push the price closer to $28,000.

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, providing benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, concerns about its long-term financial viability are intensifying. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, which could lead to a 23% reduction in benefits if no legislative action is taken. This forecast is driven by outgoings outpacing income due to an aging population, fueling public anxiety and declining confidence in the system's future. Potential solutions being debated include raising the cap on income subject to payroll taxes or increasing the full retirement age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on federal corruption charges following a multi-year investigation into her conduct. The indictment alleges that Cantrell engaged in a conspiracy to use her public position for personal benefit, including allegations related to an improper relationship with her bodyguard, a now-retired police officer. The charges also stem from a previous indictment of a local businessman accused of providing gifts to the mayor. Cantrell is the first mayor in the city's history to be federally charged while still in office, adding to a turbulent second term set to end in January 2026.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to place the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The lawsuit calls the action a "brazenly unlawful" and "hostile takeover" that infringes on the district's right to self-governance. President Trump invoked a never-before-used provision of the Home Rule Act to assert emergency powers, citing high crime rates. The city is seeking a temporary restraining order to block the directive, arguing that crime has actually declined over the past year and that the takeover puts residents at risk. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on the matter.</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge has dismissed a lawsuit from Drake as "groundless and indeed ridiculous." Drake is suing UMG, the parent company for both his and Kendrick Lamar's labels, for defamation, alleging the company ran a campaign to promote Lamar's hit diss track "Not Like Us" at the expense of his own career. In a court declaration, Grainge stated that the accusation makes no sense, given that UMG has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Drake's career and owns his catalog. UMG's legal team further argued that the premise of the lawsuit—that Drake could only have lost a rap battle due to a secret conspiracy—is absurd.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," written and directed by Zach Cregger, is being hailed for its daring narrative that provides clear answers to its central mystery. The movie follows a community grappling with the inexplicable disappearance of a third-grade class, ultimately revealing a supernatural villain whose defeat provides a moment of cinematic catharsis. However, the review notes that the film cleverly subverts this triumphant feeling by reminding the audience that vanquishing evil does not erase the trauma it caused. By exploring the lingering grief and loss, the film is described as a "feel-bad, feel-good movie" that delivers a satisfying conclusion without offering easy emotional closure.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced an investigation into Meta following a report that the company's internal guidelines permitted AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children. The probe will examine whether Meta's AI products enable child exploitation and if the company misled the public about its safety measures. The investigation was prompted by a Reuters report citing an internal document that detailed acceptable chatbot behaviors, such as describing a child's "youthful form" as a "work of art." A Meta spokesperson stated the examples were erroneous, inconsistent with company policy, and have since been removed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation projects the average tax savings for individuals under President Trump's recently enacted tax bill, with benefits varying significantly by state. In 2026, the average taxpayer is expected to save $3,752, with residents in states like Wyoming, Washington, and Massachusetts seeing the largest cuts, often exceeding $5,000. The analysis notes that these averages can be skewed by high-income earners, particularly in wealthy areas and resort towns like Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office reported that while top earners will benefit, the lowest-income households could see their resources fall due to cuts in social programs.

          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season less predictable than in the past, leading them to adjust flight schedules in response to changing consumer behavior. Travelers are booking flights earlier in the season or shifting trips to the fall, while economic uncertainty and last-minute bookings have complicated planning. In response, U.S. airlines have reduced domestic capacity for August by 6% compared to July, a larger cut than in previous years. This reduction in flights is intended to better align supply with demand but is also expected to contribute to rising airfares for consumers during a period of fluctuating travel trends.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C., which he used to justify a federal takeover of the city's police, finds them to be misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has since dropped significantly in 2024 and 2025. According to the city's police data, violent crime has seen a 26% reduction in the past year, aligning with a broader national trend of decreasing crime rates. The fact check concludes that describing crime as 'out of control' today overstates the current downward trend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy is sending mixed signals, leaving economists and the central bank uncertain about its direction. While President Trump's tariff policies and immigration crackdown have sparked fears of "stagflation"—stagnant growth combined with rising prices—key economic indicators are conflicting. The labor market has shown worrisome weakness with sluggish job creation, yet consumer spending has remained surprisingly resilient, and the stock market has continued to rise. Recent data showed a concerning acceleration in wholesale prices, suggesting future price hikes for consumers, but retail spending also grew, making it difficult to determine if the economy is heading for a recession or will power through the challenges.
