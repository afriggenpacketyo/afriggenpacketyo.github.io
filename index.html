          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Wednesday as investors reacted to new industrial profit data from China. China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, slipping only 1.5% year-on-year after months of steeper declines, which was attributed to Beijing's efforts against price wars. Meanwhile, steep U.S. tariffs of 50% on Indian exports are set to take effect, potentially impacting India's trade. Despite some "irrational exuberance" in mainland Chinese indices, analysts suggest any market correction might be shallow due to improving liquidity and a dovish Fed outlook.

This initiative coincides with the unusual sight of National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, performing cleanup duties in prominent parks. While some Guard members patrol with police, about 110 are assigned to litter removal, highlighting a broader political debate over the city's public perception. Despite an expected drop in international visitors for 2025, the city anticipates a boost from America's 250th anniversary in 2026 with several major renovations and openings planned.</p>

          <p>Third seed Coco Gauff secured a hard-fought victory against Ajla Tomljanović in the US Open first round, winning 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in a nearly three-hour marathon match. Despite a shaky serving performance, including ten double faults and six breaks, Gauff demonstrated impressive resilience to close out the contested match. Her serve, a known area for improvement, remains a work in progress, even with recent team changes. Gauff responded strongly after faltering when serving for the match, breaking back immediately to seal her progression into the next round, where she will face Donna Vekić. This win keeps her potential path to the world No. 1 ranking still open.</p>

Boyu Capital, Advent International, Bosideng International, and a consortium led by FountainVest Capital and Anta Sports Product have submitted bids. This potential exit comes as Canada Goose struggles with growth momentum in key markets, facing declining revenues in Canada, China, and EMEA, and questioning its brand positioning. Going private could offer buyers more autonomy to address these challenges away from public scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's substantial export economy faces significant challenges as the U.S. implements a steep 50% tariff on its goods, effective Wednesday. These tariffs, imposed by President Trump over India's Russian oil purchases, are expected to diminish India's attractiveness as a manufacturing hub and could reduce its GDP growth by up to 0.6 percentage points. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, are particularly vulnerable. The article highlights concerns about India's eroded export competitiveness compared to other nations that received tariff reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a reduced decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of contraction in five months. This improvement follows a period of steeper drops and is attributed to Beijing's policy efforts aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and enhancing corporate margins. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell 1.7%. While state-backed firms saw a larger profit drop, businesses with foreign investments recorded a slight increase. The manufacturing and utilities sectors showed profit improvements, contrasting with a significant plunge in the mining industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing mortgage fraud allegations, has sparked concerns among Wall Street analysts about the central bank's independence. Cook denies the allegations and has vowed to contest her firing in court, asserting her legal right to a 14-year term, removable only "for cause." Analysts suggest that if successful, Trump could gain a majority on the Fed's Board of Governors by mid-2026, potentially influencing monetary policy. However, the Federal Reserve Act protects governors, and the legal battle could escalate to the Supreme Court, creating market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft requested police intervention to remove protesters who entered its Redmond headquarters, occupying President Brad Smith's office. The group, "No Azure for Apartheid," demanded Microsoft sever ties with Israel and condemn alleged genocide in Gaza, citing the Israeli military's use of Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure. Smith stated that while employee expression is tolerated, trespassing and planting listening devices are unacceptable, leading to the removal of seven individuals, including two employees who may face disciplinary action. This incident highlights growing controversy in the tech sector over defense contracts amidst the escalating conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The NAACP and Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law have filed a lawsuit against Texas, alleging that new congressional maps are racially biased and dilute the voting power of Black citizens.

This action follows a contentious debate in the Texas House, where Democrats accused Republicans of racism in the redistricting process.

The documents are connected to "Crossfire Hurricane," the FBI's probe into Russian election interference. The investigation has intensified after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents, alleging "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era intelligence leaders to undermine Trump, claims that former President Obama's spokesperson called "ridiculous."</p>

          <p>The small town of Mason, Tennessee, is deeply divided over the decision to reopen a shuttered private prison as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center. Town leaders supporting the move, like Mayor Eddie Noeman, cite the promise of over 200 new jobs and significant revenue for the financially struggling community. However, Alderwoman Virginia Rivers and other residents oppose it, raising ethical concerns about mistreatment of detainees and the nature of for-profit prisons. The reopening follows President Trump's reversal of a policy that previously led to the facility's closure, reigniting a debate over the role of private detention in local economies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn another $175 million in funding for California's high-speed rail project, further jeopardizing the state's long-delayed infrastructure initiative. This latest cut, following an earlier cancellation of $4 billion in federal grants, targets grade separation, over-crossing, and design work, as well as a station in Madera. California has sued to challenge these withdrawals, deeming them illegal and politically motivated. The project, initially projected for 2020 completion at $33 billion, now faces costs up to $128 billion with service not expected until 2033, highlighting significant financial and political hurdles.

          <p>Grocery giant Kroger is laying off nearly 1,000 corporate employees as part of a business restructuring effort aimed at trimming costs. This move follows a failed $24.6 billion merger with Albertsons last year, which was blocked by a federal judge and several states due to antitrust concerns. Kroger, which operates over 2,700 stores nationwide, has also faced other challenges, including store closures and a former CEO's resignation. Despite these setbacks, the company remains viable, with investor confidence reflected in its stock performance. Kroger is now focused on competing independently and growing its e-commerce business, despite it currently being unprofitable. (not investment advice)</p>
