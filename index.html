The announcement followed news that Giuliani was injured in a car accident in New Hampshire but is now out of the hospital and recovering. Trump praised Giuliani as the "greatest Mayor in the history of New York City," though the honor comes after Giuliani was disbarred in 2024 for his efforts to help overturn the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million as part of its long-term 'Project 150' strategy, which aims for a Premier League title by the club's 150th anniversary in 2028. The club chose the promising but less experienced Lammens over Aston Villa's World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez. This decision was heavily influenced by data analysis, which rated Lammens highly in key metrics like shot-stopping and progressive passing, aligning with the club's focus on building for the future.</p>

The phenomenon was caused by a coronal mass ejection from the Sun interacting with the Earth's atmosphere.

          <p>Researchers at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre have developed a compact, detergent-free washing machine designed for use in space. The 12kg device uses an ultra-fine mist of water combined with ozone, generated by UV light, to clean and sterilize clothing. This innovation addresses the significant logistical challenge of laundry on long-duration space missions, where water is an extremely limited and valuable resource, potentially improving astronaut hygiene and comfort.</p>

          <h2>Health Officials Confirm Ticks Carrying Lyme Disease Found in Every New Jersey County</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 23:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Jersey health officials have confirmed that ticks capable of transmitting Lyme disease are now present in all 21 counties of the state. This finding highlights a significant public health concern, as the pests are expanding from traditional wooded areas into more populated suburban and urban environments. Experts attribute this spread to a warming climate, which creates more favorable conditions for ticks to survive and thrive, thereby increasing the risk of vector-borne illnesses for residents.</p>

          <h2>Major Cuts to US SNAP Benefits Begin, Affecting Millions of Low-Income Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 22:30:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New policies are enacting what some estimate to be the largest cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in history, impacting food security for millions of Americans. An estimated 2.4 million people are expected to lose benefits, with families facing monthly reductions of up to $231. While the cuts will create hardship for low-income households and strain independent grocers, analysts suggest large discount retailers could see increased traffic as shoppers seek to maximize their limited budgets.

          <p>The UK government is introducing new legislation that will give the justice secretary the authority to veto sentencing guidelines issued by the independent Sentencing Council. Under the new rules, both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice must approve any new guidance before it can be implemented in the courts of England and Wales. This move, which increases political oversight, follows a contentious dispute over proposed guidelines concerning pre-sentence reports for offenders from certain minority groups.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has suggested that new and improved versions of its hypersonic missiles, the YJ-21 and DF-17, could be displayed at the upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing. A report from broadcaster CCTV specifically mentioned a potential air-launched variant of the YJ-21 missile, which could be deployed from bombers to penetrate enemy air defenses from long distances. This hints at China's continued development of a versatile family of advanced hypersonic weapon systems.</p>
