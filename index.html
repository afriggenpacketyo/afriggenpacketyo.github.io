            <p>Across the United States, numerous anti-Trump rallies took place, protesting the administration's policies and perceived threats to democratic ideals. Events ranged from demonstrations in major cities like New York and Washington D.C., to smaller gatherings commemorating the American Revolutionary War's 250th anniversary. Protesters voiced concerns over civil rights, government downsizing, and executive overreach, drawing parallels to historical struggles for freedom. Some demonstrators expressed fears of a growing police state and the erosion of constitutional checks and balances.</p>

            <p>The Tren de Aragua, a powerful Venezuelan gang, emerged from the Tocorón prison amid Venezuela's economic crisis. The gang expanded its operations beyond the prison walls, engaging in drug trafficking, extortion, and kidnappings. With members now dispersed across South America and even gaining attention in the U.S., the gang's activities have become a focal point in political debates about immigration and border security. Despite efforts to dismantle the gang, its influence continues to spread, raising concerns about transnational crime and security.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, ordering a cessation of military activities for a 30-hour period. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement, citing ongoing Russian drone strikes and questioning the sincerity of the ceasefire.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary block on the deportations of Venezuelans detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law. The court's order came in response to an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that the detainees were being denied the opportunity to contest their deportations in court. The Trump administration has invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly remove immigrants identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, prompting legal challenges and concerns over due process.</p>

The FAIR Plan has become overwhelmed due to increased cancellations by private insurers in fire-risk zones. Plaintiffs seek damages, arguing insurers prioritized profits over providing adequate coverage to homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

The upcoming 47th ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur presents an opportunity for ASEAN to invite leaders from both countries to discuss trade issues. By leveraging its convening power, ASEAN could provide a neutral platform for dialogue and potentially help break the impasse between the US and China. (not investment advice)</p>

Zelensky stated that Ukraine would adhere to the truce if Russia genuinely ceased military activity, but reported ongoing fighting in various regions. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister expressed skepticism, citing a history of Putin's words not matching his actions. The UK also called for a full ceasefire, not just a brief pause for Easter.</p>
