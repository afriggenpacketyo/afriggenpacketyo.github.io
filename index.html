          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, responding to a lawsuit filed by the school. The Department of Homeland Security had revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, alleging the school tolerated anti-American agitators. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating Harvard would suffer immediate and irreparable injury without it. The ban affected over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, and the lawsuit claimed the revocation violated the First Amendment and Due Process Clause. The judge has scheduled a court hearing for Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Stocks tumbled after President Trump threatened new tariffs on Apple and the European Union, causing market instability. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all experienced declines following Trump's Truth Social posts about imposing a 25% tariff on Apple if it didn't move iPhone production to the U.S. and a 50% tariff on the EU. European markets also reacted negatively, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 falling sharply. Analysts expect continued market volatility due to upcoming tariff announcements and existing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury yields retreated from recent highs as investors grew concerned over President Trump's escalating trade war. Trump's social media posts recommending a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. sent investors flocking to the safety of bonds. This shift occurred after a week of Treasury sell-offs driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and the U.S. credit rating downgrade by Moody's. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 5 basis points to 4.505%.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order in Trump v. Wilcox, signaling it will not allow President Trump to fire members of the Federal Reserve, despite appearing eager to expand presidential authority over independent agencies. The order, while difficult to parse legally, reassures investors that the Fed's ability to make technocratic decisions about interest rates will not be disrupted. The case involves former members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, whom Trump fired, but the Court's Republican majority indicated they would not extend this authority to the Fed due to its 'uniquely structured, quasi-private entity' status.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago by donating $50,000 to a local charity, Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts. The lawsuit sought restitution for the cost of investigating Smollett's claims of being the victim of a hate crime, which police determined was a hoax. Smollett's conviction on charges of staging the attack was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court on double jeopardy grounds. The city believes this settlement provides a fair resolution, allowing all parties to move forward, and Smollett expressed gratitude for the resources to defend himself and donated an additional $10,000 to the Chicago Torture Justice Center.</p>

          <p>President Trump reignited trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in America. Trump stated the EU has been 'very difficult to deal with' and that discussions were going nowhere, with the new tariffs set to begin on June 1. The EU did not immediately respond, but analysts suggest this is a negotiating tactic. The announcements caused stocks to fall in the US and EU, with Apple shares also declining. The EU is one of the US's largest trading partners, and Trump has long complained about the uneven trade relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the United States, expressing his expectation that iPhones sold in America should be manufactured and built domestically.

While Apple primarily produces its flagship phone in China, it has been shifting manufacturing to India due to a more favorable trade relationship with the U.S. Analysts estimate that moving iPhone production to the U.S. would significantly raise the price of the smartphone.</p>

Pinker highlights instances where heterodox opinions are voiced without issue and emphasizes that universities are committed to free speech, even speech that is disliked.

He said that for nearly 80 days, Israel blocked the entry of life-saving international aid, placing the entire population of Gaza at risk of famine. Guterres emphasized that without rapid, reliable, safe, and sustained aid access, more people will die, and the long-term consequences on the population will be profound. Israel says about 300 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since it lifted an 11-week blockade, but Guterres says only a third have been transported to warehouses due to insecurity.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee attended the Cannes Film Festival premiere of his new movie, 'Highest 2 Lowest,' wearing Knicks-themed couture. The film, a reworking of Akira Kurosawa's 'High and Low,' stars Denzel Washington. Washington received an honorary Palme d'Or at the event. The festival has been marked by divisive movies and bold artistic swings. Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson star in Lynne Ramsay's 'Die, My Love,' which has polarized critics. Kristen Stewart's directorial debut 'The Chronology of Water' has also received mixed reviews.</p>

Proving financial hardship and demonstrating a good-faith effort to pay can increase the chances of stopping or reducing the garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>
