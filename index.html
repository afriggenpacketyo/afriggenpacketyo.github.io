          <p>The U.S. military is deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and its strike group to the South American region, significantly escalating its presence to disrupt illicit drug trafficking. This move follows a series of rapid strikes against suspected drug boats, which have killed at least 43 people since early September. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth likened the anti-drug campaign to the war on terror, stating the U.S. would "hunt down, and kill" narco-terrorists. Critics, including Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and some U.S. lawmakers, question the legality and true motives of these operations, fearing destabilization and unauthorized military action.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has confirmed its first West Nile virus death of 2025, involving an anonymous individual hospitalized in the San Fernando Valley with neurological illness. This brings the total infections in the county to 14 this year, half of which are in the San Fernando Valley, a region experiencing persistent drought conditions. Studies suggest that droughts can increase West Nile virus risk by concentrating infected mosquitos and birds around limited water sources, accelerating transmission. Public health officials are warning residents about the potential for severe, permanent, or fatal illness from the mosquito-borne virus, urging vigilance during mosquito season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to auction offshore oil drilling leases in new areas along the U.S. coastlines as early as 2026, including waters off New England, the Carolinas, and California, regions previously off-limits for decades. This initiative, part of the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, reverses a Biden administration decision and expands drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The proposal faces strong bipartisan opposition from state governors and lawmakers due to environmental and economic risks. Despite past efforts being blocked, the administration is proceeding, with public comment periods expected before final implementation.</p>

          <p>Virginia Attorney General candidate Jay Jones is facing renewed political fallout after reports revealed his wife donated to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a bail organization that critics allege used millions to release violent offenders, including accused sexual assaulters and murderers. Mavis Jones's 2020 social media post supporting the fund, which freed individuals like a twice-convicted sexual assaulter and a murder suspect, has sparked controversy. This adds to a series of scandals for Jones, including violent text messages directed at Republican leaders and a reckless driving conviction, impacting his tightening race against incumbent Jason Miyares.</p>

          <p>Representative Adam Smith (D-WA) has accused Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) of "effectively dissolv[ing] the United States House of Representatives" by keeping it out of session during an ongoing government shutdown. Smith argued this inaction prevents crucial oversight of the Trump administration's foreign policy, specifically referencing legally questionable bombings of Venezuelan boats. He expressed concern that the lack of congressional checks allows the president unchecked power, drawing historical parallels to the Reichstag. The House remains adjourned as a resolution to fund the government and address healthcare subsidies remains elusive.</p>

Judge Karin Immergut cited the administration's attempt to evade her initial order and an ongoing appeals court review as reasons for the delay. This ruling is part of a broader legal battle across multiple cities, where judges are challenging President Trump's authority to deploy military forces to Democratic-run areas despite local resistance and low crime rates.

This intensified deportation campaign coincides with increased U.S. military strikes against suspected drug trafficking vessels in South American waters.

          <p>A high-profile China spy case in the UK collapsed because a top national security official, Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Collins, refused to state that China had been officially classed as an "enemy" between 2021 and 2023. This designation was deemed "fatal to the case" by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, as proving China's "enemy" status was crucial under the Official Secrets Act. The decision has sparked a political blame game, with former officials suggesting the current Labour government's desire for warmer relations with Beijing influenced the outcome.

          <p>Britney Spears and ex-husband Kevin Federline are offering vastly different perspectives on their tumultuous relationship and Spears's conservatorship in their respective memoirs. Spears's "The Woman In Me" describes feeling controlled and humiliated, while Federline's "You Thought You Knew" argues she needed help and that the conservatorship provided normalcy for their children. Federline's book also alleges Spears never truly moved on from Justin Timberlake. The memoirs reignite public debate about the pop star's past, with Federline expressing concern about her current state and the "Free Britney" movement's impact.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern Scotland where daylight can be under six hours, over a million people in the UK experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD, a recurring seasonal depression, is linked to reduced daylight and causes symptoms like low mood and anxiety. Researchers are promoting creative and cultural resources, including "Wintering Well" boxes with therapeutic lamps and activity guides, to encourage outdoor life and new "light routines." The initiative aims to shift attitudes towards winter, drawing lessons from Scandinavian nations on creating cozy interior light environments.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget, arguing it's unlikely to foster an investment culture in the UK. While Reeves aims to encourage investment, the proposed reduction from £20,000 to £10,000 for cash ISAs faces opposition from banks and consumer groups. With a £22bn budget shortfall, Reeves is seeking ways to raise taxes or cut spending. The article highlights that cash ISAs are the most widely used, holding £360bn, and cutting the limit could negatively impact savers without achieving the desired investment shift.

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in UK driving, with one in three cars now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatics, driven by the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. This presents a dilemma for new drivers: learn manual for broader license freedom or automatic for a potentially quicker test. Many aspiring automatic learners face challenges like a lack of instructors and higher lesson costs. Despite a common misconception, manual tests have a higher pass rate. The article explores individual experiences and the evolving landscape of driving education, noting a lingering stigma around automatic-only licenses.</p>

          <p>Counting is set to begin in the Irish presidential election, which will determine the 10th Irish president to succeed Michael D Higgins. Voters chose between two main contenders, independent Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, though a third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew too late to be removed from the ballot. Early indications suggest a potentially low turnout, possibly struggling to reach the 2018 record low of under 40%. The results are anticipated to be announced at Dublin Castle later this evening, following a months-long campaign.</p>

          <p>Magnesium has become a popular supplement, with its global market projected to nearly double, driven by social media influencers touting its benefits for sleep, digestion, and mental health. While magnesium is vital for over 300 bodily processes, including brain and mood regulation, dietitians caution that supplements are only beneficial if one is deficient, which is difficult to test. The article highlights individual anecdotes of improved sleep but notes conflicting scientific evidence. Experts recommend focusing on diet first and exercising caution with supplements due to potential side effects and interactions, especially for those with kidney disease.</p>

          <p>Election season in Tanzania brings renewed terror for individuals with albinism, as superstition-driven ritualistic attacks intensify, fueled by false beliefs that body parts bring wealth or political success.

Despite government crackdowns, awareness campaigns, and a monument commemorating victims, attacks persist, with one recorded this year. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has warned against harmful traditional beliefs, but activists emphasize the need for continued community involvement and government action to protect this vulnerable population.</p>
