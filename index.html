        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a notable increase, reaching its highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index, with an additional adjustment for the Memorial Day holiday. Refinance applications rose significantly, and purchase applications also climbed, potentially due to increased housing inventory. Despite economic uncertainty, homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on loosening housing inventory in some markets, even as interest rates remain relatively stable. The market awaits new inflation data and trade talk outcomes, which could influence bond market movements and subsequently affect mortgage rates. Optimism surrounding potential market stabilization is tempered by ongoing economic uncertainties, making future trends difficult to predict. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the idea of "recession pop," referring to upbeat pop music from the Great Recession era, and whether it can predict economic trends. Experts argue that while music reflects emotions, it's unlikely to be a reliable economic indicator, noting that various types of music existed during the recession. The trend of "recession pop" might be more about millennials asserting their cultural preferences as they age into positions of influence. While recession pop dance parties are real, the genre itself is a recent invention, not a recognized category during the actual recession. The author's analysis suggests that attributing economic predictive power to music may be an oversimplification of complex cultural and economic factors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have banned teaching antisemitism in public schools, arguing it was an attack on educators. Hobbs stated the bill placed unacceptable personal liability on educators and staff, exposing them to costly lawsuits. The bill would have prohibited teachers from promoting antisemitism or actions that create a hostile environment, with violators personally responsible for damages in lawsuits. Opponents of the bill claimed it would silence those speaking out on Palestinian oppression and threaten teachers' ability to provide a full account of the Holocaust. The governor's veto reflects a concern for protecting educators from undue legal risks and ensuring a balanced approach to addressing antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a robust recovery in 2025, with registrations surging across the EU and the UK, driven by fleet sales and regulatory mandates. However, consumer skepticism, charging infrastructure limitations, and Tesla's declining sales due to political controversies present challenges to sustained growth. Chinese automakers are gaining ground with state subsidies, intensifying competition in the European EV market. The EV transition remains uneven across Europe, and the relaxation of emissions targets could slow momentum, indicating a complex and evolving landscape for electric vehicle adoption.</p>

          <p>The article revisits the 1992 debate between President George H.W. Bush and The Simpsons, exploring the underlying values and cultural divides. Bush's preference for The Waltons over The Simpsons reflected a perceived difference in decency and moral courage. However, the author argues that The Simpsons, despite its irreverence, upheld moral values and resonated with middle-American families. The incident illustrates the complexities of using pop culture to score political points and the importance of understanding the nuances of popular entertainment. The show's creators responded to Bush's criticism with humor, further highlighting the cultural divide.</p>

          <p>The deployment of military forces to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration raids represents a concerning escalation towards authoritarianism, according to the article. The Trump administration's actions, including the use of the word "insurrectionists" to describe protesters, echo a desire to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would authorize the military to suppress dissent. The author argues that the government is weaponizing itself against its own citizens, undermining constitutional principles and civil liberties. The events in LA, combined with surveillance and propaganda efforts, are seen as indicative of a slide towards fascism.</p>

          <h2>Preserving Trees While Increasing Housing Density: A Climate Solution in Seattle</h2>

          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for more housing and the preservation of trees to combat climate change, with a new state law requiring increased housing density but not more trees. The Bryant Heights development exemplifies building density while preserving trees, integrating 86 housing units and mature trees on a single block. Architects emphasize saving trees and building around them, requiring extra negotiations and costs but enhancing community value. Seattle's updated tree protection ordinance seeks to balance housing and tree canopy growth, although recent assessments show canopy shrinkage, prompting efforts to reverse the trend.</p>
