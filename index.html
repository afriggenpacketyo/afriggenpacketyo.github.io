          <p>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has explicitly warned Israel against annexing parts of the West Bank in retaliation for the UK's recent recognition of Palestinian statehood, a significant policy shift. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced this decision, emphasizing it aims to revive hope for a two-state solution and asserting that Hamas will have no future role in governance or security. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the move, calling it a "huge reward to terrorism," while a UN commission recently accused Israel of genocide in Gaza, which Israel vehemently denies. The UK is actively working with regional partners to protect peace, justice, and security in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has issued warnings as Super Typhoon Ragasa is expected to make landfall along coastal areas from Shanwei in Guangdong province to Wenchang in Hainan sometime on Wednesday. From Tuesday to Thursday, heavy torrential rain, with some areas potentially receiving up to 280mm (11 inches) of precipitation, is forecast across Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, prompting significant preparedness efforts. Guangdong, which was recently hit by Typhoon Mitag over the weekend, has already implemented a series of preventive measures and warnings to brace for the anticipated strong winds and heavy downpours from this powerful storm. This article highlights the extensive regional impact expected.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a mixed opening as investors closely monitor the Trump administration's surprise order to significantly raise the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000. This new policy, which took effect on Sunday, is designed to protect American jobs but has left major tech firms, heavily reliant on these visas for highly skilled international personnel, scrambling to reassess their recruitment plans. India has sharply criticized the measure, warning of potential humanitarian consequences due to family disruptions. Meanwhile, euro zone consumer confidence data is anticipated, and Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed following China's decision to keep its loan prime rates unchanged.</p>

          <p>This article investigates the complicated relationship between birth control pills and women's sex drive, highlighting diverse experiences from women globally. Many reported a significant drop in libido, often without prior medical warning, while some experienced no change or even an increase due to reduced pregnancy anxiety. Research suggests the pill can increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which reduces free testosterone levels, potentially dampening desire. The article also discusses other side effects like vaginal dryness and mood swings, while acknowledging that libido is influenced by multiple factors beyond just the pill, urging for more open dialogue and awareness.</p>

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg described the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's relationship with US President Donald Trump as "cringey," urging Starmer to uphold British values rather than constantly deferring. Clegg argued the UK shouldn't have to choose between the US and the EU, calling the current approach a "miscalculation." Separately, the Liberal Democrats, at their conference, are advocating for health warnings on social media apps for children, similar to those for cigarettes and alcohol, to address concerns about mental health and excessive screen time.

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The project involves repurposing the Northern Runway and expanding terminals, potentially increasing flights to 389,000 annually by the late 2030s. Despite government enthusiasm and support from some Labour figures, the expansion faces strong opposition from climate campaigners and the Green Party, who deem it a "disaster for the climate crisis" due to concerns over pollution and emissions.

          <p>Officials are issuing warnings regarding "Reggie," a dolphin known for interacting with swimmers off England's south coast, whose behavior has become alarmingly aggressive due to human habituation. Incidents include pushing women underwater, leading experts to fear for both human safety and the dolphin's well-being. Marine Connection states Reggie is not malicious but unaware of his strength, and has already sustained propeller injuries. Authorities emphasize avoiding contact, feeding, or approaching dolphins, reminding the public that human interaction can cause animals to lose natural wariness and become dangerous. This article highlights the critical need for wildlife respect.</p>

          <p>Rachael De Foe, a Singapore-native, successfully tripled her income to $220,000 annually by quitting her 9-to-5 job and establishing her own public relations and communications company. Embracing "fractional work," she now serves multiple clients part-time as a head of communications, leading strategy rather than just executing tasks. This model, which gained traction during the pandemic as companies sought leaner solutions, has provided her with greater autonomy and work-life balance, allowing her to escape burnout. De Foe advocates for this approach, particularly for experienced professionals in service-based businesses, as detailed in this article. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, defying expectations of a cut despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate reduction. This decision aligns with economists' views that Beijing is holding off major stimulus amidst a stock market rally, even as economic data signals fatigue. August saw retail sales slow, industrial output growth ease, and consumer prices fall, with a worsening real estate slump and decreased export growth. The offshore yuan strengthened slightly against the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" UAV, identified by the number 21 on its fuselage, represents one of the People's Liberation Army's most advanced uncrewed systems. Recent observations, including visible folding hinges on its wings and its appearance on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, suggest a naval variant, possibly the GJ-21. These clues indicate the GJ-11 could be the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone, poised for crucial roles in intelligent warfare and enhancing China's military capabilities.

          <p>Donald Trump has indicated that media moguls Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell, could be involved in a deal to bring TikTok's U.S. operations under American control. This potential partnership would join Oracle founder Larry Ellison, whose involvement was previously known, in ensuring the app's data security. The proposed deal aims to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, which lawmakers deemed a security risk due to potential Chinese manipulation. Trump, who initially opposed but later praised TikTok's election influence, stated progress was made during a recent call with China's Xi Jinping, as reported in this article.</p>
