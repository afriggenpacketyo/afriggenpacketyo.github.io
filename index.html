          <h2>Southwest Airlines Reduces Flight Capacity Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 17:10:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines announced plans to cut flight capacity in the latter half of the year, signaling weaker domestic bookings due to 'macroeconomic uncertainty.' The airline anticipates unit revenue to remain flat or decline by up to 4% in the second quarter compared to the previous year. Citing the unpredictable economic climate, Southwest is also retracting its earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026, aligning with similar moves by United and Delta, who are also scaling back domestic capacity. These adjustments will result in a 1% increase in Southwest's full-year capacity compared to 2024.</p>

          <p>The European Union has levied substantial fines against Apple and Meta for breaching the bloc's digital competition regulations. Apple was fined 500 million euros for preventing app developers from directing users to cheaper options outside the App Store, while Meta received a 200 million euro fine for requiring Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying for ad-free versions. Both companies plan to appeal the decisions, arguing that the EU is unfairly targeting American businesses. These penalties are part of the EU's Digital Markets Act, aimed at promoting consumer choice and preventing Big Tech from dominating digital markets.</p>

Chipotle anticipates a return to positive transaction growth in the second half of the year and plans to open between 315 and 345 new restaurants by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his refusal to accept Russian control of Crimea, asserting that it is hindering peace negotiations. Trump claims a deal to end the war was "very close" but that Zelenskyy's stance is prolonging the conflict. This follows US Vice-President JD Vance's proposal for a deal that would "freeze the territorial lines" and require both Ukraine and Russia to concede territory. Trump's comments reflect a strained relationship with Zelenskyy and an intensifying US effort to broker a peace agreement, although the chances of success remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A dozen states have filed a lawsuit against President Trump and his administration, seeking to block his new tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that the tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy. Trump's tariffs include a 145% tariff on products from China and tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of a pet dog by Fresno County sheriff’s deputies is expected to cost taxpayers at least $2 million after an appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2018 incident in which deputies entered a home without consent and shot the family dog, Scooby. The county appealed the decision, but lost, resulting in significant damages and attorney fees.</p>
