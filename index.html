          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has terminated Omead Afshar, the company's vice president of manufacturing, amid declining car sales in key markets like Europe. Afshar's dismissal follows a previous internal investigation in 2022 and the recent resignation of another key executive from the Optimus robotics program. The leadership change occurs as Tesla's stock has underperformed this year, facing increased competition from European and Chinese EV brands and reputational challenges linked to Musk's political activities.</p>

Early research suggests that the negative impacts, such as deteriorated lung function, may appear years after exposure and could be cumulative.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a 'genetic switch' that could enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically limited in vertebrates like humans. Their study, published in Science, found that mice fail to regenerate because they cannot produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair. By reactivating a dormant DNA pathway, the researchers successfully triggered ear regeneration in a mouse, a finding that could have significant implications for regenerative medicine across different tissue types.</p>

          <p>The potential inclusion of alternative investments like cryptocurrency and private equity in 401(k) plans is generating controversy among financial experts. Recent regulatory shifts under the Trump administration could open the door for these high-risk, high-reward assets in workplace retirement accounts. Proponents, like BlackRock's CEO, argue this democratizes access to potentially high returns, but investor advocates warn of the dangers posed by their volatility, high fees, and lack of transparency for average retirement savers.
