          <p>Marking the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, this article reports that 48 hostages, including both living individuals and the deceased, are still held captive in the Gaza Strip. It details statements from U.S. officials who are advocating for a peace deal based on President Trump's proposed 20-Point Plan to secure their release. The piece provides context by sharing the personal stories of several hostages, such as Omer Neutra and Evyatar David, to illustrate the prolonged suffering endured by the captives and their families while diplomatic negotiations continue in Egypt.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner are traveling to Egypt to participate in ongoing indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, aimed at ending the two-year-long war in Gaza. The negotiations, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, are centered on a U.S.-proposed plan that includes the release of the remaining 48 hostages and the disarmament of Hamas in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal. While the plan has received broad international support, Hamas has demanded guarantees that Israel will not resume hostilities, a point of contention in the high-stakes discussions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees looking to buy a new home can use a specialized financial product called a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for Purchase. This option allows individuals aged 62 and older to combine a significant down payment, typically 45% to 62% of the home's price, with funds from a reverse mortgage to complete the purchase. The primary advantage is that it eliminates the need for monthly mortgage payments, freeing up fixed retirement income for other living expenses. However, borrowers must still cover property taxes, homeowners insurance, and maintenance costs to keep the loan in good standing.</p>

          <p>Thirty paintings by beloved television artist Bob Ross are set to be auctioned to raise funds for small and rural public television stations facing financial strain due to federal funding cuts. The collection, valued between $850,000 and $1.4 million, includes works created on-air during his popular show, "The Joy of Painting." All proceeds will help stations affiliated with American Public Television cover licensing fees for popular programming. This initiative aims to preserve Ross's legacy of making art accessible while supporting the medium that brought his work into millions of homes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case challenging Colorado's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, a practice aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The case highlights a clash between First Amendment speech rights for therapists and the state's power to regulate professional medical conduct based on established standards of care. During the hearing, conservative justices like Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch questioned the reliability of medical consensus, suggesting it can be politicized. The Court's decision could redefine the extent to which states can regulate professional advice deemed harmful.</p>

          <p>A recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that American consumers are growing more pessimistic about their financial futures due to expectations of rising inflation. The monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations found that fewer people believe their household's financial situation will improve in the coming year, and expectations for household spending growth have declined. This cautious outlook is largely driven by persistent high prices for essentials like groceries and gas. Despite these concerns, overall consumer spending has remained relatively strong, helping to prevent a more significant economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

Their sentences include 12 months of home confinement followed by six months under a curfew, in addition to community service.

However, Bravo noted a key difference from the past: today's AI boom is being financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets, which provides a more stable foundation than the speculative venture capital of the late 1990s.</p>

          <h2>White House Suggests Some Furloughed Federal Workers May Not Receive Back Pay</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 13:16:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering denying back pay to some furloughed federal workers once the government shutdown ends, a move that appears to contradict a 2019 law guaranteeing such compensation. President Trump stated that whether employees are paid "depends on who we're talking about," suggesting some "don't deserve to be taken care of." This stance is outlined in a draft White House memo that argues Congress must specifically appropriate the funds, despite the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act making back pay automatic. The move is seen as a pressure tactic to compel Democrats to approve a funding bill.</p>

          <p>A youth-led movement in Morocco, known as Gen Z 212, has organized some of the country's largest recent anti-government protests, demanding political and social reforms. Operating anonymously, the group coordinates its actions primarily through the online platform Discord, which was originally popular with gamers. Organizers use the platform to hold democratic votes on protest strategies, disseminate information, and maintain security against infiltration by authorities. The movement, sparked by anger over conditions at a public hospital, reflects a new, digitally native form of decentralized activism that prioritizes collective decision-making and anonymity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed new measures that would cut its tariff-free steel import quota by nearly half and impose a 50% tariff on amounts exceeding that limit. This move could trigger a major crisis for the UK steel industry, as the EU is its largest export market, accounting for almost £3 billion in trade. UK industry leaders fear the tariffs could be "terminal" for many steel companies and have urged the government to negotiate for country-specific quotas. The EU's proposal aims to protect its own producers from cheap imports and global overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is weighing a First Amendment challenge to Colorado's law banning licensed counselors from performing "conversion therapy" on minors. A Christian counselor argues the law unconstitutionally censors her speech by preventing discussions aimed at aligning a young patient's gender identity with their biological sex. The state contends it is regulating professional conduct to protect minors from a practice widely deemed harmful and ineffective by major medical associations. The justices' questions explored the line between protected speech and the state's authority to set standards of care, with the outcome potentially impacting similar laws nationwide.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of using its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers for more than just circumventing sanctions, claiming the vessels are also being used for intelligence gathering and sabotage operations in Europe. Following a briefing from his foreign intelligence chief, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine is collaborating with its international partners to counter this threat. This development is part of the ongoing conflict, which also saw new drone strikes reported in the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region and the oil-rich Tyumen region of Siberia, over 2,000 kilometers from the front line.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to cardiologists, adopting the habit of eating a fiber-rich snack in the afternoon is a key strategy for lowering cholesterol. Soluble fiber, in particular, helps by binding to cholesterol in the digestive system and preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. In addition to directly lowering LDL ("bad") cholesterol, high-fiber foods promote a feeling of fullness, which can aid in weight management and support healthy blood sugar levels. Experts suggest snacks like an apple with nuts, roasted chickpeas, or yogurt with raspberries to help meet daily fiber goals and improve cardiovascular health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing growing disruptions to air travel, with staffing shortages among unpaid air traffic controllers leading to flight delays and cancellations nationwide. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that the situation could worsen as controllers, who are considered essential workers, face financial strain. The shutdown is also threatening to halt the Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes flights to approximately 170 rural communities and could run out of funding by the end of the week. The disruptions highlight the cascading effects of the political stalemate in Washington.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, moderate Republicans are reportedly exploring ways to break the impasse, though they have not yet conceded to Democrats' primary demand. Democrats are refusing to vote for a funding bill unless it includes an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies set to expire soon. Senator Susan Collins has circulated a proposal to negotiate the ACA extension after the government reopens, but key Democrats insist the issues must be resolved together to maintain leverage.

Chasing a modest target of 179, England's batting lineup faltered against spin, collapsing to 103-6 and raising fears of a major upset. However, Knight, aided by a crucial partnership with Charlie Dean, guided the team to victory in the 47th over.
