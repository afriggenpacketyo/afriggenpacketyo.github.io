          <p>The article discusses the suspicious death of Kendy Howard, who was found in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head, initially reported as a suicide by her husband, Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper. Investigators became suspicious due to several unusual factors, including the fact that it is uncommon for a woman to shoot herself in the tub, the presence of broken glass and wet towels, and the discovery of a packed duffle bag. One of the most intriguing clues was an unfinished dryer cycle that appeared to have been started just before Dan Howard called 911, leading investigators to theorize about his involvement in her death. Dan Howard was later arrested and tried for the murder of his wife.</p>

          <p>This article details the events leading to the arrest and conviction of Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, for the murder of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy had told Dan she wanted a divorce just days before her death, which was initially reported as a suicide. However, investigators found several inconsistencies at the scene, including a packed duffle bag and a running dryer, leading them to suspect foul play. The article highlights the testimony of Kendy's daughter, who accused Dan of the murder, and the eventual arrest and trial of Dan Howard, who was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

Historian Arash Azizi cautions against military intervention, emphasizing that change must come from within Iran for lasting stability and that a diplomatic resolution could create more freedom for pro-democratic activities.</p>
