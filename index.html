          <p>The Chinese government has issued a sharp warning to the Philippines, urging its leadership to cease “playing with fire” regarding Taiwan. The admonition came after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. remarked that his country could not avoid involvement in a potential US-China conflict over the island due to its geographic proximity. Beijing responded by stating that such rhetoric violates international law, undermines regional stability, and reneges on the Philippines' commitment to the one-China principle. China's foreign ministry emphasized that Taiwan is an internal affair and that no external interference will be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to expand military operations by taking full control of Gaza City, escalating the 22-month war. The plan reportedly involves evacuating civilians to southern areas by October 7 before imposing a siege and launching a ground offensive to dismantle remaining Hamas forces. The decision has drawn criticism from families of Israeli hostages, who fear it will endanger their loved ones, and has been rejected by Hamas. The move comes amid a dire humanitarian crisis, with the World Health Organization reporting record levels of child malnutrition in Gaza.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, has detailed China's objective to build a "world-class" military by mid-century. The piece defines this goal as achieving top-tier global indicators and dominating the central stage of military competition. It explicitly states that China must use the world's most powerful militaries, particularly that of the United States, as a benchmark for its development. The ambition covers not just weapons and equipment but also military theory, talent development, and training, aiming to ensure China can protect its national security and prevail in international competition.</p>

          <p>Shares of SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record high, marking their best performance in five years. This significant increase followed the company's announcement of a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, which vastly surpassed analyst expectations and represented a major turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. The strong results were largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, attributed to the performance of both private and listed portfolio companies. Several of its invested companies, including Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart, are also preparing for initial public offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers are in stable condition after being shot in what officials described as an ambush in Susquehanna County. The incident began when 61-year-old Carmine Faino fatally shot his 57-year-old neighbor, Lori Wasko, outside her home. When troopers arrived at the scene, Faino opened fire with a rifle, wounding both officers before they were evacuated by colleagues. After a standoff during which the suspect shot down a police drone, he was shot and killed by law enforcement, ending the threat to the public.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new figure, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who collaborates with cartels to bring fentanyl-laced cocaine into the United States. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020, with an initial bounty of $15 million that was later raised to $25 million. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased reward as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate distraction from other issues.</p>

This marks the fourth time a court has blocked the policy, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration has argued that the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to parents without permanent legal status or allegiance to the country.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that California's fire season is starting significantly earlier and lasting longer than it did three decades ago, a shift primarily attributed to human-caused climate change. Researchers determined that in some regions, like the Cascade Range, the season begins 46 days earlier than in the early 1990s. The primary drivers for this change are earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation caused by rising average temperatures. The findings quantify the anecdotal sense among residents that wildfire risk is a near-constant threat, with the state already on pace for a more destructive year than average.</p>

According to experts, Nevada law does not automatically report temporary mental health holds to the national background check system as a disqualifying event.

          <p>The bodies of a man and a woman were discovered fatally shot inside a car along the Pacific Coast Highway near Point Mugu State Park in Ventura County. A passerby found the vehicle and alerted authorities, who determined the 45-year-old man and 46-year-old woman had been deceased for several days. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Office is leading the investigation into the deaths as a double homicide. Investigators believe it was an isolated incident and that there is no immediate threat to the public, though details about the motive or potential suspects have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are reportedly moving away from dating apps and returning to old-fashioned, in-person methods of meeting potential partners. Companies like Date Cincy in Cincinnati are hosting popular singles events that cater to individuals tired of swiping and seeking genuine face-to-face connections. This trend is reflected in market data, with Bumble's stock value declining significantly and event platforms like Eventbrite reporting a 42% rise in attendance at dating and singles events. Participants cite a desire for authentic interactions and a way to avoid the pitfalls of online misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, which are typically high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats while being low in fiber, are even more prevalent in the diets of young people, accounting for nearly 62% of their caloric intake. The report identified top sources as sandwiches, sweet bakery products, savory snacks, and sweetened beverages. This data reinforces growing public health concerns, as previous research has linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods to numerous adverse health outcomes.</p>

Under the "one-in, one-out" pilot scheme, dozens of individuals have been taken to immigration removal centers and could be returned to France within weeks. For each migrant returned, the UK has agreed to accept an approved asylum seeker from France who has not attempted an illegal crossing. The government has stated that anyone arriving on a small boat is now eligible for immediate detention and return, aiming to deter the dangerous crossings.</p>

          <p>Instagram's parent company, Meta, is facing user backlash following the launch of a new map feature that shares a user's location with their friends. Although the company stated the tool is an opt-in feature, many users expressed alarm on social media, with some claiming their location was being shared by default. Concerns were raised about the potential for stalking and the danger it could pose to individuals with restraining orders.

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental daily pill, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial. Participants in the 72-week trial lost an average of 27.3 pounds, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound. Common side effects included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to impose stricter geographical restrictions on serious sexual and violent offenders after their release from prison. Instead of traditional exclusion zones where an offender cannot go, the new system would confine them to a specific, pre-approved area, monitored by enhanced electronic tagging. The Ministry of Justice states this new approach would provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. However, some probation officers have raised concerns that the plan could increase their already heavy workload.</p>

However, earnings per share of $1.86 fell short of expectations due to commodity cost inflation. Management noted that positive sales trends have continued into the third quarter but acknowledged that elevated beef costs will remain a significant headwind for the steakhouse chain.
