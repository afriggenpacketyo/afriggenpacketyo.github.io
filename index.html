          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is slated to attend a significant military parade in Beijing on September 3, commemorating the 80th anniversary of China's victory against Japan in World War Two. This event is believed to be his first international meeting with multiple heads of state, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, since 2019. China plans to showcase its latest weaponry and fully display its new military force structure, an event analysts and Western powers will closely watch. Kim's presence highlights China's growing geopolitical influence and represents a crucial diplomatic win for President Xi, signaling his central role in regional affairs amidst ongoing global tensions and US efforts to engage with both leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe is currently experiencing its most severe wildfire season on record, with over one million hectares scorched across the European Union, particularly impacting Spain and Portugal. This escalating crisis is directly attributed to climate change, which fosters hotter, drier conditions and increases vegetation flammability, as confirmed by studies. The fires have released a record 17.68 million tonnes of CO2 in Spain alone, intensifying the climate feedback loop. Experts caution that more frequent and intense fires are expected, compounded by rural depopulation in Southern Europe, which leads to abandoned, overgrown land that eliminates natural fire breaks and heightens vulnerability to blazes.</p>

          <p>Florida's contentious "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration facility, located in the Everglades, is anticipated to be empty of detainees within a few days, as confirmed by a state official. This development follows a U.S. District Judge's order last week, which effectively halted new detainee transfers and wound down operations. The judge denied the Trump administration's and Florida officials' appeal to stay her order, emphasizing the facility's temporary design despite claims of overcrowding elsewhere and significant shutdown costs. The center had been the subject of multiple lawsuits, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently announced plans for another new immigration facility, dubbed "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>A horrific shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in south Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children, aged 8 and 10, and injuries to 17 others, including 14 children, during a morning Mass. The 23-year-old shooter, identified as Robin Westman, whose mother was a former school employee, fired a rifle through church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, noting videos posted by the shooter describing attack plans and suicidal thoughts. This devastating event, occurring on the first week of school, has led to a massive community response and national mourning.</p>

The ride aims to ensure the historical atrocity is never forgotten, serving as a powerful reminder of America's journey towards racial justice and the enduring need for healing and progress.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense gained momentum in a civil trial concerning an alleged 2018 assault on security guard Emani Ellis, who is seeking $24 million. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, testified she never physically contacted Ellis, whom she suspected of filming her during a doctor's appointment. Key testimony from the obstetrician and his receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, supported Cardi B's account, with Malcolm stating Ellis reached for the rapper and caused a cut on her own forehead. The defense rested, asserting Ellis is motivated by a large financial payout, while the jury awaits closing arguments to determine the outcome of the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue, forecasting sales growth to remain above 50%, which underscores strong demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite these positive top and bottom-line beats, the stock experienced a dip in extended trading due to data center revenue falling slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. The company's finance chief projects between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. Nvidia also noted that while it sold no H20 chips to China this quarter, it could ship between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 revenue if geopolitical conditions permit, and its board approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases.

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei's campaign caravan was attacked with stones, plants, and bottles in Buenos Aires province, though he was unhurt. The incident forced an early end to his rally, intensifying political tensions just days before provincial elections and ahead of crucial midterm elections in October. Milei, campaigning to address chronic fiscal deficits and spiraling inflation, was riding in a pickup truck with his sister when the assault occurred. Protesters shouted "Out with Milei!" and scuffles erupted between his supporters and opponents, resulting in rib injuries for one woman backing the president. This event underscores the volatile political landscape and public discontent in Argentina.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has finally appointed Steve Kang, president of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison, fulfilling a key campaign promise after a two-and-a-half-year delay. Industry advocates had expressed frustration over the absence of a dedicated point person to help filmmakers navigate city bureaucracy. Kang, who will be supported by Dan Halden and producer Amy Goldberg, will serve as the primary contact for film and TV productions seeking to shoot in Los Angeles. This appointment is seen as crucial for supporting the city's signature industry, which has been losing production jobs to regions offering more attractive tax incentives and filming conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and federal law enforcement agents to Washington D.C. is significantly escalating tensions, viewed by many as an unprecedented assertion of presidential authority over local governance. While the National Guard's visible presence is a political statement, the core of the issue lies in increased immigration raids by federal agents, detaining individuals unable to prove legal residency on their way to work. Residents have vociferously protested these operations, perceiving them as targeting essential community members rather than criminals and fostering fear. With the city's Metropolitan Police now under federal control, the capital is described as "creeping towards a tipping point" amidst a climate of perceived occupation and division.</p>

          <p>California is anticipated to face an increase in intense dust storms, or haboobs, a phenomenon already observed in the Salton Sea area, driven by climate change, water overuse, and other environmental factors. These storms, which can reach thousands of feet high and travel long distances, carry significant health risks as disease- and chemical-laden particles are inhaled. They also negatively impact solar panel efficiency and accelerate mountain snowmelt. Researchers at "UC Dust" are actively working to improve forecasting and understanding of these events, which are challenging to predict and disproportionately affect dry, vulnerable regions and millions of Californians.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed a "real possibility" of introducing the company's advanced Blackwell AI processor to the Chinese market, while advocating for U.S. government approval for American chipmakers. Huang projected China's AI market could expand by 50% next year, potentially offering Nvidia a $50 billion opportunity if it can supply competitive products. He recently engaged with President Trump to secure export licenses for Nvidia's current-generation H20 chips, believing that enabling sales of modified Blackwell chips could deter China from developing its own advanced alternatives. The company's financial chief noted that while no H20 chips were sold to China this quarter, future sales could range from $2 billion to $5 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

FEMA, however, defended its actions, accusing the signatories of being "bureaucrats" resistant to necessary reforms aimed at efficiency and accountability.

          <p>Manchester United faced a humiliating exit from the Carabao Cup, suffering a second-round defeat to fourth-tier Grimsby in a penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw. This unexpected loss significantly intensifies pressure on manager Ruben Amorim, whose team concluded last season in 15th place despite a substantial £200 million investment in attacking players this summer. Amorim's post-match comments, where he admitted not understanding what happened to his team, have further fueled skepticism regarding his leadership and the efficacy of his tactical system. The defeat prompts serious questions for United's senior management about the club's strategic direction and the manager's long-term future.</p>

While the number of children receiving free hours has risen, concerns remain regarding a projected shortage of 35,000 staff and 70,000 places needed by September, along with the uneven distribution of childcare provisions across the country, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>

The Atlantic article argues this controversy reflects annoying impulses in American life, positing that Cracker Barrel has historically been a corporate simulacrum of rural authenticity, rather than a genuine small-town establishment. The article contends the drab new logo and broader aesthetic revamp were merely a natural evolution of the chain's corporate mission to sanitize vernacular culture. The rapid reversal underscores the deep-seated consumer conservatism regarding brand identity, reminiscent of similar boycotts affecting other companies.</p>

UK business owners and industry groups are advocating for immediate action, contending that the exemption unfairly undercuts domestic retailers and potentially exposes consumers to unregulated or unsafe products.
