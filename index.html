          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive is laying off approximately 4% of its workforce, affecting more than 600 employees, as it contends with significant market challenges. The company is facing slower-than-expected demand for EVs, substantial financial losses, and a difficult regulatory environment, including the expiration of federal purchasing incentives. This move comes as Rivian has narrowed its 2025 delivery forecast and projected a larger adjusted core loss for the year, reflecting broader pressures on the electric vehicle industry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. The White House statement framed the decision as an end to the "Biden Administration's war on cryptocurrency," arguing that Zhao's prosecution was politically motivated and damaging to U.S. innovation. The pardon is notable given reports that the Trump family's own crypto ventures have been assisted by a trading platform administered by Binance.</p>

          <p>Known for its budget-friendly, open-seating model, Southwest Airlines is implementing major changes to attract premium travelers. The airline will introduce assigned seating, bigger overhead bins, in-seat power, and an extra legroom section, officially ending its decades-old open boarding policy in early 2026. This strategic shift, which also includes new fees for checked bags, reflects a broader industry trend where even discount carriers are adding premium options to compete for a wider range of customers.</p>

          <p>In a preview for her reality show, Kim Kardashian, 45, revealed that doctors discovered a small brain aneurysm during an MRI scan. Her doctors reportedly attributed the condition to stress, which she linked to her highly publicized divorce from Kanye West. A brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel, and the article notes that most small, unruptured aneurysms are not considered serious. The revelation provides context for the emotional difficulties she has faced in recent years.</p>

          <p>The economic regulator Ofwat has ordered water companies across England and Wales to refund over £260 million to customers due to poor performance on issues like pollution and leaks. This penalty comes as the Environment Agency issued its worst-ever combined environmental rating for the sector in 2024, highlighting a spike in serious pollution incidents. Despite the refund, customer bills are still projected to rise significantly by 2030 to finance essential upgrades to the crumbling water infrastructure.</p>

This deep division among victims highlights the significant challenges and turmoil surrounding the establishment of the national inquiry into child sexual exploitation.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the UK's planned inquiry into grooming gangs reveals that its progress is being stalled by fundamental disagreements among the survivors advising its creation. Key points of contention include whether the inquiry's scope should be narrowly focused on gangs or cover broader child sexual exploitation, and who is qualified to serve as its chairperson. These divisions, alongside criticism of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, expose the profound difficulty in building a process that can earn the trust of all victims.</p>

          <p>Two government watchdog groups have raised serious concerns that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, may be illegally destroying federal records. Halligan reportedly used the encrypted messaging app Signal with an eight-hour auto-delete setting to discuss government business with a journalist. The groups argue this practice violates the Federal Records Act and Department of Justice policies, calling for an investigation into her conduct, particularly in light of her role in politically charged prosecutions.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Israel, Vice President JD Vance strongly criticized a preliminary vote in the Israeli parliament to advance a bill for the annexation of the occupied West Bank, calling it a "very stupid political stunt." Vance emphasized that annexation is not the policy of the Trump administration and stated that he was personally insulted by the timing of the vote. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office also condemned the move, describing it as a deliberate provocation by the opposition.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching their highest level in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. The uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers. However, the market remains challenging, as a historically low supply of homes for sale continues to exert upward pressure on prices, which have now risen year-over-year for 27 consecutive months.

          <p>Climate scientists are monitoring a severe marine heatwave in the north-western Pacific Ocean, nicknamed "the blob," which could alter weather patterns across North America. With ocean temperatures 2.5°C above preindustrial levels in August, the phenomenon is expected to increase the risk of flooding in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and potentially lead to an unusually cold and snowy winter in eastern parts of the continent. These heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, disrupting marine ecosystems and posing significant weather-related risks.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical look at the 14 U.S. government shutdowns that have occurred since 1980, when a legal opinion from the Attorney General established that federal agencies must cease non-essential operations during a funding lapse. The analysis notes that shutdowns, once rare, have become a more frequent tool in political battles over the last decade. The longest shutdown, which occurred in 2018-2019, caused an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses, highlighting the significant consequences of these funding gaps.</p>
