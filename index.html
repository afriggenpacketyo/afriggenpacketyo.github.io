          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and hospitalized after responding to a call about a suspicious person at an ICE detention facility. The officer, who was later released, was ambushed when multiple suspects opened fire. Following the incident, eight armed individuals, some wearing body armor, were taken into custody after attempting to flee the scene. The Justice Department is monitoring the situation, which appears to have been a coordinated attack intended to lure law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was marred by a failure of the electronic line-calling system. Play was halted when the system failed to make a call on a point-ending shot that was visibly out, forcing the umpire to order a replay of the point. Pavlyuchenkova expressed frustration, stating a game was "stolen" from her and questioning why the chair umpire didn't overrule the technology. The incident has sparked debate about the system's reliability and the role of umpires in the age of automated officiating.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, a 1-in-500-year rainfall event, underscore the immense difficulty of forecasting extreme weather. An analysis shows that while the National Weather Service issued a series of escalating warnings, including a top-level Flash Flood Emergency, the sheer volume of rain was hard to predict precisely. Despite staffing cuts, forecasters identified record atmospheric moisture, but pinpointing the exact location and intensity of such historic downpours remains a major challenge. The disaster serves as a stark example of how climate change is pushing weather events beyond the limits of current forecasting models.</p>

          <p>The operator of the Greek oil tanker Vilamoura has stated that an external explosive device was the likely cause of a blast that damaged the vessel off the coast of Libya. The tanker, carrying a million barrels of oil, suffered an explosion in its engine room, causing it to lose power and take on water. Maritime security sources suggest a limpet mine may have been used, marking the fifth such incident in the region recently. The damaged vessel has since been safely towed to Greece, and its crew is reported to be in good health.</p>

          <p>A family in Shoreham, New York, is living in a camper in their backyard after a contractor they hired allegedly disappeared with nearly $100,000. The family paid Robert Cortese of Tool Time Construction $96,200 to renovate their home, but after gutting the interior, he vanished, leaving the house uninhabitable. The family later discovered the contractor was unlicensed and listed on the county's "Wall of Shame," making them ineligible for a victim reimbursement fund. The case, which is now under police investigation, serves as a cautionary tale for homeowners.</p>

The story of a 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis, whose family made the perilous journey to Italy, has highlighted the crisis. Decades of political chaos have left Libyan hospitals unable to provide specialized care or essential medicines, forcing families to seek desperate alternatives.

          <p>Thailand is making a new proposal to Washington in an effort to avoid significant U.S. tariffs set to be imposed if a deal isn't reached by July 9. The offer aims to reduce its $46 billion trade surplus with the U.S. by 70% over five years, with a goal of reaching a balance within eight years. Thailand's finance minister stated that the country is hoping for a baseline 10% tariff rate but would find a rate between 10% and 20% acceptable. This move comes as the U.S. has threatened a 36% levy on Thai imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have called for significant structural reforms to better defend against drone warfare. Citing the crucial role of drones in recent global conflicts, the experts suggest the PLA will likely establish specialized counter-drone units to enable rapid responses. The article indicates that while dedicated units are a long-term goal, the immediate focus is on integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing combat formations like electronic warfare units.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has criticized efforts to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, calling the move "shortsighted" and "misguided." His comments come as the White House and some in Congress seek to defund public media entities like PBS and NPR, claiming they spread "woke propaganda." Burns, whose films have been a staple of PBS for decades, argued that public broadcasting is a vital American institution, particularly for rural areas where it may be the only available signal for educational, emergency, and cultural programming.</p>

Washington's aggressive negotiating tactics and the uncertainty of its demands have sent shockwaves through the global economy.
