          <p>At least seven people died after a highway bridge collapsed onto railway tracks in Russia close to the Ukraine border, according to emergency services. The collapse in Bryansk brought down several heavy trucks onto a moving passenger train on Saturday night, injuring 31 others. Moscow Railway alleged the bridge collapsed "as a result of illegal interference in transport operations," prompting an investigation. A second bridge collapsed along the Trosna-Kalinovka highway in the Kursk region, injuring a freight train driver and causing a fire.</p>
