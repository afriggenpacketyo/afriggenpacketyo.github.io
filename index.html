          <p>The potential revival of the Constitution Pipeline project is creating a political tug-of-war between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul, with Coterra Energy positioned to benefit significantly. The pipeline project, which was shelved five years ago, has resurfaced after Trump lifted a stop-work order on the Empire Wind 1 project. Coterra CEO Tom Jorden has emphasized the importance of the Constitution Pipeline, which would originate in their Marcellus field in Northeast Pennsylvania and extend into the New England market. If the pipeline were to be built, Coterra would commit to delivering long-term volumes into the line, representing a potential future opportunity for growth in the Marcellus.

This investigation was disclosed after President Donald Trump threatened to revoke federal funding from California if it ignored his executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports. The Justice Department is examining whether California's School Success and Opportunity Act conflicts with Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in schools or educational programs receiving federal funding. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated that Title IX exists to protect women and girls in education and that allowing males to compete against girls is perverse.</p>

Research universities like Harvard apply for federal grants through a competitive process for specific purposes, such as scientific research, while trade schools offer vocational training. Experts argue that Harvard's money cannot simply be funneled to another recipient, as the grants are awarded based on merit and specific research projects.
