          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered its key interest rate from 2.25% to 2% for the eighth time in just over a year, citing concerns over the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs on the eurozone economy. The ECB anticipates that trade uncertainty will negatively affect business investment and exports in the short term. While economic growth showed promise between January and March, the central bank expects a potential weakening throughout the year, though medium-term growth is projected to be supported by increased European spending on defense and infrastructure. Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with Trump to discuss tariffs and defense spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased following the release of higher-than-expected weekly jobless claims, with first-time filings reaching 247,000, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 236,000. The 2-year yield fell slightly to 3.873%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 4.353%. This movement follows sharp declines on Wednesday due to disappointing U.S. data, including weakened services sector activity and lower-than-expected private sector payroll increases. Despite these figures, Deutsche Bank suggests that the numbers are not severe enough to trigger recession fears, and traders are now focusing on the upcoming nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate data.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone regarding the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, a conversation initiated at Trump's request. This discussion follows accusations from Trump that China violated a previous agreement to roll back tariff rates, although Beijing denies these claims and accuses the U.S. of provoking trade frictions. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett mentioned that the presidents would discuss the Geneva agreement, focusing on slow-rolling license approvals for rare earth materials.

Ocasio-Cortez highlighted Mamdani's ability to build a coalition of working-class New Yorkers. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, proposes free city bus rides, rent freezes on rent-stabilized apartments, and city-run grocery stores, funded by a $10 billion tax increase on businesses and the wealthy. The endorsement comes as Mamdani gains traction in polls, seeking to replicate Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 upset victory.</p>

The spill was initially reported as a smaller incident at a Johns Hopkins facility, but later discovered to be much larger at a nearby marina. Over 100 personnel worked overnight to contain the spill using booms and skimmers, with efforts to flush the storm drain system also underway. Officials have assured the public that there is no evidence the spill is affecting drinking water, but traffic disruptions are expected during the cleanup.</p>

          <p>Proposed tariffs by President Trump could substantially raise the prices of imported goods like clothing and shoes, according to pricing models created by AlixPartners. Under a 30% tariff, the price of a men's cotton sweater and a pair of men's shoes made in China could increase by approximately 19%. If a 145% tariff were implemented, those prices could spike by around 90%. Similarly, a 10% tariff on goods from Vietnam could raise prices by about 8%, while a 46% levy could lead to a roughly 35% increase for the same items. These models assume retailers pass along the full cost of the tariffs to consumers.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank has reduced interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the deposit facility rate to 2%, after eurozone inflation fell below the 2% target in May. The ECB also revised its inflation expectations downward for 2025, citing a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Despite the rate cut, one governing council member dissented, and ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that the outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual. The central bank's decision comes amid rising geopolitical tensions and concerns about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies on economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
