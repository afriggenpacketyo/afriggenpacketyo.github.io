          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a wet-dry Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a timely safety car intervention. Oscar Piastri, Norris's McLaren teammate, initially led the race after overtaking Kimi Antonelli at the start, but the safety car, triggered by a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, shuffled the order. Norris pitted for slick tires just before the safety car was deployed, allowing him to rejoin the race in the lead. Max Verstappen, who finished fourth, was later penalized for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to 17th.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay by psychiatrist Awais Aftab highlights the often-overlooked challenges associated with antidepressant use, particularly withdrawal symptoms. While acknowledging the life-saving potential of these medications for some, Aftab points out the lack of research and guidance for safely tapering patients off antidepressants, leading many to seek help in online communities. He emphasizes the need for more research into the long-term effects and safe withdrawal strategies, cautioning against both alarmism and dismissal of patients' concerns. The article underscores the importance of transparent and balanced advice regarding psychiatric medications, recognizing both their benefits and trade-offs.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, a family-run business for 50 years, is facing new challenges due to declining consumer sentiment. Owner Stanley Kallivrousis notes a decrease in customer foot traffic and changes in eating habits, with people sharing meals more often and taking leftovers home. The article connects this local experience to broader economic trends, including a drop in consumer confidence and rising prices expected by corporate executives due to tariffs.

Authorities believe the crash was intentional, with evidence suggesting Hinton drove directly at the deputy. The officer who shot Ryan Hinton claimed the teenager pointed a gun at him during a chase following a call about a stolen car. Body camera footage showed an officer shouting "he's got a gun" before shots were fired, though there was no indication Ryan Hinton fired at police.</p>

The BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence service, designated the AfD as a threat due to its xenophobic stances and incompatibility with the country's democratic order.

          <p>Mali's military junta is planning to extend its rule until 2030 without democratic elections, according to a "national conference" boycotted by the opposition. The conference proposed dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter, limiting the number of permitted parties to five, and tightening conditions for founding new parties. Amnesty International condemned the move as an attack on freedom of expression and association. Opposition parties fear the junta will strengthen its crackdown on political dissent, similar to its allies in Niger and Burkina Faso. The junta had previously announced a return to civilian rule by March 2024 but postponed elections.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier tariffs on imported cars. The new duties will affect even US-made cars, as they often contain foreign-made components. The administration claims the tariffs aim to protect national security by incentivizing domestic production, but automakers warn of significant cost increases and potential supply chain disruptions. The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive three-year term, marking the first time in 21 years an Australian prime minister has achieved this. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance. The election was fought against a backdrop of cost-of-living concerns and generational change, with both sides promising policies to help first-home buyers. Albanese criticized Dutton's campaign for mimicking American-style politics, emphasizing his government's improved relations with China. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his re-election.</p>

          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), which has governed since 1959, secured another sweeping victory in the general elections, winning 87 out of 97 seats in parliament. The results strengthen the mandate of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who faced his first test at the ballot box since taking office last year. While the PAP was expected to remain in power, a younger and more vocal electorate has challenged its previously unchecked dominance. Living costs and housing availability were key concerns for voters.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia won a second term, a victory for the center-left Labor Party despite trailing in polls due to cost-of-living issues. The conservative opposition, led by Peter Dutton, suffered a resounding defeat, with Dutton even losing his own parliamentary seat. The election occurred amid global uncertainty from the Trump administration, with voters opting for the known quantity of Albanese. The campaign largely avoided ambitious changes to address fundamental economic issues, focusing instead on short-term relief proposals.</p>

          <p>In Oakdale, California, residents have largely abandoned traditional media outlets for a mix of online sources, leading to uncertainty about what information to trust. The decline of local newspapers and the rise of partisan cable networks have contributed to this shift, with residents now turning to podcasters, online influencers, and Facebook groups for news. This has resulted in the spread of misinformation and political polarization, as evidenced by a 2020 incident where an armed militia showed up in town based on a false rumor spread on Facebook. Some residents are now seeking alternative news sources that offer a range of perspectives.</p>

The action has halted efforts to vet safety equipment, spot counterfeit protective gear, and address new safety standards.
