          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has voiced serious concerns about the escalating and dangerous rhetoric from politicians aimed at judges. Speaking at a judicial conference, he highlighted that such language can incite violence, referencing past threats against justices from both Republican and Democratic leaders. Roberts emphasized that political disagreements should not lead to personal attacks that undermine the judicial process and endanger the lives of judges simply for performing their duties. He stressed the importance of the appellate review process for challenging judicial decisions, rather than impeachment or threats.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new training strategy focused on building resilience and team cohesion. Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" to simulate Olympic conditions and learn to perform well under unfamiliar or challenging circumstances, such as travel delays or shared living spaces. The initiative, trialed ahead of the world championships, has reportedly improved team morale and motivation. Officials hope this approach will better prepare swimmers for the pressures of the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule, leading to clashes with riot police. The demonstrations, which are among the largest in recent months, were met with tear gas and stun grenades, resulting in dozens of arrests. The protests, sparked initially by a deadly railway station roof collapse attributed to corruption, have grown to encompass broader grievances against the government, which President Vucic has dismissed as a foreign plot.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As heatwaves become more intense, urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than the surrounding countryside due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. Dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, while a lack of vegetation and water sources reduces natural cooling through evaporation. This can make city centers several degrees warmer, especially at night, exacerbating the health risks of extreme heat like dehydration and heat stroke. With global populations increasingly concentrated in cities, this effect poses a growing challenge.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has sparked significant controversy and protests from local residents. Hundreds marched through the city, arguing that the extravagant event highlights the exploitation of Venice while its citizens struggle with overtourism, high costs, and environmental threats. Activists criticized the wedding as an affront to the city's fragile state, dismissing a large donation from Bezos as a token gesture.

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to address the rising incidence of melanoma skin cancer. The initiative, set for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases melanoma risk later in life, and this preventative education is crucial as cancer cases are projected to rise. The program seeks to empower children to take responsibility for their own skin health.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration of opposition against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly a reaction to the government's attempts to ban the march under a controversial "child protection" law that critics say equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, championed the event as a celebration of freedom and human rights, sending a clear message of defiance to the ruling Fidesz party's socially conservative policies.</p>
