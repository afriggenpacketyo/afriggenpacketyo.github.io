        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Royal experts suggest Prince William is resolute in his decision to permanently sideline his uncle, Prince Andrew, from any official royal role. This stance is driven by concerns that Andrew's association with Jeffrey Epstein poses a significant reputational risk and threat to the monarchy's stability. While King Charles maintains a private familial relationship, he reportedly supports William's hardline approach to protect the institution's public image, ensuring Andrew will not return to public life under the future king's reign.</p>

          <p>Beijing has reportedly offered tax refunds to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy and Martell, as an anti-dumping investigation into European brandy nears its conclusion. To receive the refund, companies must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices, according to an anonymous source. The move comes as a potential resolution to a trade dispute that could see temporary tariffs of up to 39% become permanent if no agreement is reached.</p>

While the ECB has successfully removed past price shocks from the system, Lane cautioned that the bank must remain prepared to address new shocks and potential cyclical movements to maintain medium-term stability.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices recorded their most significant monthly decrease since February 2023, falling by 0.8% in June. This decline may be linked to reduced demand following recent changes to stamp duty thresholds that increased the tax burden for many buyers. Despite the drop, annual price growth stood at 2.1%, and economists expect market activity to recover due to supportive factors like low unemployment and earnings outpacing inflation.

          <p>Four major car dealer associations in China's affluent Yangtze River Delta have issued a public appeal to automakers, warning of severe financial challenges. The dealers cite high inventories, disorderly competition from an ongoing price war, and an increased risk of cash flow problems as major pressures on their businesses. They accuse some automakers of forcing them to sell cars below cost and are calling for an overhaul of sales strategies, including more reasonable inventory limits and sales targets.</p>

          <p>A new Iowa law that took effect Tuesday makes it the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, eliminating non-discrimination protections for transgender and nonbinary people in areas like housing and employment. The law also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents changes to birth certificates, a move Governor Kim Reynolds called "common sense." LGBTQ+ advocates and the state's first transgender lawmaker fear the law will lead to increased hostility and discrimination, calling it a major setback for human rights.</p>
