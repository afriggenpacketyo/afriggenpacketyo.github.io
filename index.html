          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed a fifth death this year from Vibrio vulnificus, a rare flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters. Infections can occur through open wounds exposed to contaminated water or by consuming raw seafood, with two of this year's deaths linked to raw oysters. Experts note an increase in cases, not just in the Gulf Coast but also moving up the East Coast, potentially due to rising ocean temperatures. This year, Louisiana has seen 26 documented cases, a significant increase from the state's decade-long average of seven infections and one death annually.</p>

Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the one enacted, emphasized his decision was made independently amidst growing concerns over the Fed's autonomy under the Trump administration. He dismissed concerns about a potential conflict of interest from his leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisers, stating he is committed to explaining his differing economic views. The President has been openly critical of the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jamie Hepburn, a Scottish government minister, has resigned after being accused of physically assaulting Conservative MSP Douglas Ross. The incident allegedly occurred after a parliamentary dispute, with Ross claiming Hepburn grabbed him and swore aggressively. In his resignation letter, Hepburn stated that irrespective of a formal breach of the Ministerial Code, his actions did not align with his personal code of conduct. First Minister John Swinney accepted the resignation with regret, acknowledging it as a "slip" in Hepburn's usually respectful approach.</p>

          <p>In response to a sharp increase in antisemitism since the October 7 Hamas attacks, a new initiative called DACH Against Hate has launched in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Founded by Professor Guy Katz and supported by prominent figures like Charlotte Knobloch, the initiative calls for stricter legislation, improved education, and better protection for Jewish institutions. Organizers have planned a large demonstration and an online petition aiming for parliamentary discussion of their five-point plan. Speakers at the launch expressed deep concern, with some drawing parallels between the current public mood and the period before the Nazis' rise to power.</p>

          <p>Estonia's foreign ministry has condemned what it calls an "unprecedentedly brazen" violation of its airspace by three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets over the Gulf of Finland. The ministry summoned the Russian chargé d'affaires to lodge a formal protest, noting the jets flew with their transponders off for 12 minutes within the NATO member's territory. This marks the fourth such violation by Russia in 2025, occurring amid heightened regional tensions and recent similar incidents involving Russian drones in Poland and Romania.

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon recently shared an experience she described as a significant "ego check" in her career. Despite optioning the rights to the novel "Gone Girl" with the intent to star in it, director David Fincher told her she was "totally wrong for this part" and cast Rosamund Pike instead. Witherspoon, who produced the film, now agrees Fincher was correct, speculating her established on-screen persona was not suited for the sinister role. She views the experience as a valuable lesson in producing, which sometimes means stepping aside for the good of the project.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call on Friday to finalize a deal concerning the future of TikTok in the United States. The call follows the establishment of a "framework" agreement earlier in the week aimed at resolving the U.S. government's national security concerns. Under a federal law, TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, must divest its American operations or face a ban. President Trump, who has previously extended the deadline multiple times, expressed his desire to keep the popular social media platform operational in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace was achieved with loosened seller vetting processes, leading to a proliferation of counterfeit and fraudulent products. Shoppers have received fake items, including potentially dangerous health supplements, from sellers who sometimes used stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create their accounts. Current and former employees stated that management prioritized growth and seller acquisition over stringent verification, creating what some describe as a "Wild West" environment. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened vetting for sellers in some categories.</p>

However, recent statements from a Chinese official suggest a potential softening, with a framework deal including an agreement on "the use of intellectual property rights."

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of U.S. tariffs on consumer prices. In this strategy, a middleman company acts as the official importer, purchasing goods from the retailer at a wholesale price and paying the tariff on that lower value before the final sale to the consumer. This "tariff arbitrage" can significantly cut duty costs, allowing brands to avoid passing the full expense of the trade war onto their customers.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, which for the first time is expected to include measures targeting Chinese entities involved in purchasing Russian oil. While the full details are pending approval from all 27 EU member states, the move signals a significant expansion of the bloc's economic pressure on Moscow. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that Russia's oil revenues in Europe have already fallen by 90% since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The new measures also aim to ban EU purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note yield hitting a two-week high above 4.13%, a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut earlier in the week. The increase in long-term yields suggests investors are weighing factors beyond the Fed's short-term policy, including expectations for economic growth, inflation, and the government's need to finance its debt. A weekly report showing fewer jobless claims helped calm concerns about a slowing economy, contributing to the sentiment that growth and inflation may remain persistent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's actions leading to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension represent a severe and explicit attack on free speech. It contends that FCC Chair Brendan Carr's threat to revoke broadcast licenses of ABC affiliates is a direct form of government coercion aimed at silencing a critic of the administration. The author refutes conservative comparisons to the Biden administration's pressuring of social media firms over COVID misinformation, arguing that Trump's actions are explicitly political and not based in public health concerns. The piece concludes that such behavior is a dangerous assault on constitutional rule.</p>

          <p>The Board of Supervisors in Johnson County, Iowa, has formally passed a resolution denouncing numerous executive orders issued by President Donald Trump during his second term. The resolution condemns 27 specific orders and broader policies related to immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental regulations, and healthcare. The document states a commitment to "protecting" and "uplifting" all community members from the impacts of these federal actions. The resolution was updated to note that many of the orders were enacted under emergency authority granted to the President by Congress, implicating Iowa's federal representatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that he will designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to face significant legal challenges, according to experts. There is currently no legal mechanism for a president to designate a domestic group as a terrorist organization, partly due to First Amendment concerns. Furthermore, antifa is described as a decentralized movement or ideology rather than a structured organization, making a formal designation difficult. While the move could prioritize antifa for federal law enforcement investigations, it would not create new chargeable offenses for domestic terrorism, as no such federal statute exists.</p>

Stephen Colbert called the suspension "blatant censorship" and warned that appeasing the "regime" would be naive, while Jimmy Fallon praised Kimmel as a "decent, funny and loving guy." The collective response from the comedy community framed the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" as a serious threat to free speech, prompted by government pressure on the network.</p>

Greenfield claimed the company was being sidelined for "fear of upsetting those in power," marking a potential end to an era of corporate social responsibility. The resignation follows legal disputes between Ben & Jerry's and Unilever, including a lawsuit alleging Unilever tried to block the ice-cream brand's calls for a Gaza ceasefire.
