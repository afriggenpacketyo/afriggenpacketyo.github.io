        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Martha's rule, which allows families to seek a second opinion on patient care, is being expanded to all acute hospitals in England following a successful pilot program. The initiative, prompted by the death of Martha Mills due to care failings, has already led to hundreds of life-saving interventions. Martha's mother, Merope Mills, advocates for UK-wide access and its implementation in maternity care. The scheme encourages open communication between clinicians, patients, and families, ensuring concerns are addressed promptly and improving doctor-patient relationships, and NHS staff can also ask for a review from a team independent of the one they work with. The expansion aims to empower patients and families to voice concerns and seek timely interventions. Optimism stems from the potential for improved patient outcomes and increased trust in healthcare. </p>

          <p>This article humorously addresses the British tendency to complain about the weather, questioning whether the sun truly shines brighter elsewhere. It invites readers to compare their location's weather to cities worldwide, offering a lighthearted perspective on meteorological conditions. The piece also playfully suggests readers could become BBC meteorologists, encouraging engagement with weather forecasting. The article also links to the BBC Weather website, offering a practical resource for those interested in detailed forecasts, as well as the fact that Britain is in fact a pleasant land. The piece is more of a diversion from news than news itself, and is mostly for entertainment.</p>

          <p>European stocks are anticipated to open slightly higher as global markets analyze the implications of President Trump's trade tariffs. A federal appeals court previously deemed most of the tariffs illegal, prompting Trump to seek Supreme Court intervention. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, alongside upcoming EU retail sales figures. The ADP private payrolls report and jobless claims data in the U.S. are also key indicators being watched ahead of Friday's jobs report. Overnight, Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains, mirroring a tech rally on Wall Street, even as economic concerns persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling that deemed many of President Trump's tariffs illegal. The administration argues that the tariffs are essential for ongoing foreign negotiations and that the ruling creates uncertainty. Businesses challenging the tariffs argue they are harming small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. The case centers on whether the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) allows the President to impose tariffs without explicit congressional approval. The Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for trade policy and the President's authority.</p>

          <p>China is providing aviation training to representatives from Southeast Asia to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, including the C919. Twenty participants from various Southeast Asian countries are attending the 2025 China-Asean Civil Aviation Management Capacity Enhancement Workshop in Beijing. The training covers safety management, airworthiness certification, and domestically produced large aircraft, as China aims to compete with Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market. The Chinese firm's nine-year-old small C909-model regional jets have operated in Southeast Asia for the past decade, making a total of 470,000 passenger trips.</p>

The valuation was revealed in portfolio documents from GSR Ventures Management, indicating a significant jump from US$26 billion in the previous quarter. Xiaohongshu has gained traction following the Chinese government's support for private firms, boosting confidence in the country's start-up scene. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein have shared emotional accounts of sexual abuse and called for the release of more files related to the convicted sex offender. One of the women, Lisa Phillips, said the group had begun compiling a confidential list of Epstein associates who they say were involved in abuse. The women urged the Department of Justice to release all documents and information from the investigation, expressing fear of repercussions if they went public with names themselves. Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna are trying to force a vote on compelling the justice department to release all documents in the case.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reinstated the retired rank of rear admiral for Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, reversing a 2022 demotion. The decision follows a review of reports and references, according to Navy Secretary John Phelan. Jackson had been retroactively demoted after an investigation found he made inappropriate comments, violated alcohol policy, and used prescription medication improperly. The decision to restore Jackson's rank comes as the Pentagon is becoming increasingly transparent in offering benefits and consideration to Mr. Trump's supporters.</p>

          <p>A Texas bill allowing residents to sue out-of-state abortion pill providers has advanced to Governor Greg Abbott. The measure aims to enforce the state's abortion ban by allowing lawsuits against those who manufacture, transport, or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas. Opponents view the bill as an intimidation tactic against providers and an encouragement of vigilantism. If enacted, the bill is expected to face legal challenges from abortion rights supporters, with the potential to impact access to abortion pills both within and outside of Texas.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have recovered an Italian painting looted by the Nazis during World War II. The "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century work by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was found after being spotted in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata. The painting had been in the possession of Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before being looted by the Nazis in 1940. The recovery of the artwork brings hope for the restitution of other looted cultural treasures and offers a measure of justice for the victims of Nazi persecution.</p>
