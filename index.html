          <p>Queen Sirikit, the revered mother of Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn and consort to the longest-reigning monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej for over six decades, has died peacefully at 93 in a Bangkok hospital. Her health had been declining since a stroke in 2012, leading to rare public appearances, and she had suffered several illnesses, including a blood infection this month. The Thai Royal Household Bureau confirmed her passing, marking the end of a significant chapter for the monarchy and a life intertwined with modern Thai history. She met her future husband while studying music in Paris, eventually marrying just a week before King Bhumibol's coronation in 1950, beginning a long and influential public life.</p>

          <p>West Ham United is enduring its worst Premier League start in 52 years, currently sitting 19th in the table with a dismal return of just four points and only one win this season. New manager Nuno Espirito Santo remains winless in his first four league games, struggling to find effective solutions for the team's numerous problems, particularly in defense. The Hammers have conceded 20 goals, with nine from corners, a record for this stage of the season. Former West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green criticized Nuno's tactical approach, calling the situation "perilous" and warning of potential relegation.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a U.S. strike on a vessel in the Caribbean Sea, allegedly operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang for drug trafficking, resulting in the deaths of all six men aboard. This operation, the first at night, marks the tenth such strike by the Trump administration, bringing the total fatalities to at least 43, and comes as the U.S. expands its anti-trafficking campaign into the Pacific Ocean. The Pentagon is also deploying an aircraft carrier strike group to the region, dramatically increasing resources. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has urged the U.S. to cease these actions, questioning their legality and effectiveness and emphasizing a focus on cartel leaders.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen topped Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, setting the fastest time ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. His title rivals, McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, struggled significantly, with Piastri notably off the pace on both short and long runs. Despite Norris handing his car over to a rookie for part of the session, McLaren's overall pace was not comparable to Red Bull's on soft tires. Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli also demonstrated strong long-run pace, while Verstappen himself complained of a lack of grip, describing the car as "driving on ice," indicating challenges even for the fastest driver.</p>

MPs argue that such a reduction is unlikely to achieve the goal of promoting an investment culture in the UK, a long-term ambition of the chancellor. Reeves had previously mulled reducing the cash ISA limit to £10,000 to encourage stock and shares investments, but faced strong opposition from banks and consumer campaigners.

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in UK driving, with automatics now comprising one-third of cars and a quarter of driving tests, driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol/diesel cars and the rise of electric vehicles. This trend presents a dilemma for new drivers: learn manual for versatility or automatic for perceived ease, though many face limited access to automatic instructors or higher lesson costs. Despite a common misconception, manual tests actually have a higher pass rate. Experts emphasize that essential driving skills remain paramount regardless of transmission type, and the stigma around automatic-only licenses is diminishing.</p>

Voters had a choice of three candidates, but the race is primarily between independent Catherine Connolly, backed by left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys. Early unofficial indications suggest a potentially low turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew from the campaign too late for his name to be removed from the ballot paper.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the U.S. of "fabricating a new eternal war" after the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier was deployed to the Caribbean, marking a significant escalation in military presence. This follows ten U.S. airstrikes on suspected drug trafficking boats, which Maduro claims are part of an intimidation campaign aimed at regime change, not just counter-narcotics. The deployment significantly increases U.S. military capability in the region, drawing condemnation from regional leaders and questions about the legality of the strikes from international experts and U.S. lawmakers. The Trump administration, however, maintains it is conducting a war on drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to intensify into a Category 4 major hurricane this weekend, posing a severe threat of catastrophic flash flooding and landslides to parts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. Hurricane conditions are expected to hit southern Haiti on Saturday, then Jamaica by Sunday, potentially making it the strongest hurricane to impact Jamaica in over 35 years. The storm's extremely slow movement will prolong its impact, with 15-25 inches of rain expected in some areas. One fatality has already been reported in Haiti due to a downed tree, highlighting the immediate danger.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump sanctioned Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family, and foreign minister after Petro accused the U.S. of "murder" and violating sovereignty by killing a Colombian fisherman in a drug boat strike. Trump's administration, which has conducted at least 10 such strikes killing 43 people, has also suspended aid to Colombia. The article questions the legality and justification of these attacks, framing them as an extraordinary power grab by the Trump administration and a use of sanctions as a tool of presidential pique. Petro has been defiant, vowing not to back down.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing for a new ballroom has sparked debate, drawing parallels to the 1814 burning of the White House but criticizing the current lack of transparency. The article argues that summarily dismantling part of the historic building without public notice undermines the idea of a republic and government by the people. It contrasts this with past renovations, which showed deference to the building's representation and involved public accountability. The new ballroom, privately funded and of significant scale, is seen as unbalancing the site and reflecting an indifference to its history and the constitutional role of Congress.</p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a pause on the province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the U.S., effective Monday, to allow trade talks to resume after President Donald Trump terminated them. Trump had criticized the ad, which quoted Ronald Reagan on tariffs, as "FAKE" and "egregious." The dispute highlights Canada's struggle to secure a trade deal with Trump, who imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, especially impacting Ontario's auto manufacturing. Ford's combative approach contrasts with Prime Minister Mark Carney's efforts, as the incident sparks debate over Canada's trade strategy and vulnerability to U.S. policy shifts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is significantly escalating its military presence in the Caribbean, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group and increasing naval assets, prompting concerns of a potential war in Venezuela. This follows at least 10 U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats, killing 43 people, which Defense officials privately questioned. The article suggests the build-up aims to destabilize Maduro's government and force regime change, rather than just counter-narcotics, despite Trump's 2016 pledge to end foreign conflicts. Experts warn of potential air strikes within Venezuela and a bloody outcome if the regime falls, drawing parallels to Libya's post-Qaddafi instability.</p>

          <p>A man executed on Tennessee death row, Byron Black, showed signs of "sustained cardiac activity" for nearly two minutes after being pronounced dead, his attorney alleged in court. This claim raises serious questions about the August lethal injection, which witnesses described as "100% botched" with Black groaning in agony and saying "It hurts so bad." EKG records, reviewed by his legal team, suggest the pentobarbital did not work as intended, and that Black may have been alive when officials declared him dead. The case increases scrutiny on Tennessee's capital punishment protocols, particularly regarding potential suffering, transparency, and the competency of execution teams.</p>
