          <p>Capital One anticipates even greater benefits from its acquisition of Discover Financial by expanding Discover's payment network internationally. CEO Richard Fairbank highlighted that international growth would allow Capital One to shift more of its branded credit cards to the Discover network, reducing reliance on Visa and Mastercard. The company projects $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027 through expense savings and network benefits, with debit-card transactions gaining a regulatory advantage.

          <p>US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to impact American retailers and consumers, particularly those involved in the Halloween and Christmas novelty markets. With nearly 90% of festive products imported from China, retailers are struggling to absorb the additional costs, potentially leading to higher prices and lower quality goods for consumers. The tariffs, introduced in early April, have disrupted supply chains and created uncertainty for businesses.</p>
