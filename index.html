          <p>Tesla is carefully considering entering the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, who cited significant tariff barriers as a major obstacle.

Tesla is actively exploring strategies to navigate these challenges and determine the optimal timing for expansion into India. Elon Musk recently discussed potential collaboration with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling ongoing interest in establishing a presence in the country.</p>

          <p>Chinese energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term LNG contracts with US providers due to escalating trade war tariffs, according to S&P Global analysts. Trade flows of US LNG to China have ceased since tariffs were imposed, and Chinese buyers now hold significant contracted US LNG volumes. While US LNG currently accounts for a small percentage of China's total imports, volumes were expected to grow substantially. The majority of LNG expected to be delivered to Chinese clients this year could be resold to other markets in the short term.</p>

          <p>Campaigners are raising concerns that Instagram still presents serious risks to children, even with the introduction of Teen Accounts designed to provide more protection. Researchers were able to create fake accounts using false birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. Meta, the owner of Instagram, maintains that its new accounts have built-in protections, but the findings suggest that more robust age verification and content moderation measures are needed. The research coincides with the upcoming publication of Ofcom's children's safety codes, which will outline rules for platforms under the Online Safety Act.</p>

          <p>Intel is planning to cut over 20% of its workforce as part of a strategy to streamline operations and refocus on an engineering-driven culture, according to a Bloomberg News report.
