          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France employed "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a public letter, Macron admitted to France's role in a brutal war that included mass displacement and support for brutal militias, which cost tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 report by French and Cameroonian historians that detailed the extent of the violence, which continued even after Cameroon's 1960 independence. The move is part of a broader, though often criticized, effort by Macron for France to confront its colonial history.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend their security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They expressed deep concern that a peace deal for Ukraine could be negotiated without their input, potentially rewarding Russian aggression and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty. In a joint statement, the leaders emphasized that any lasting peace must respect international law and Ukraine's territorial integrity. The appeal highlights European anxiety over being sidelined in high-stakes negotiations that directly affect the continent's stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health officials are warning of an increased risk from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, as rising ocean temperatures allow it to thrive in new areas. The bacteria, which enters the body through open wounds or consumption of raw seafood, has a high mortality rate, killing about one in five infected individuals. While common in warmer waters like the Gulf Coast, cases are now being reported as far north as Connecticut and New York. The trend is linked to climate change, which is expanding the bacteria's habitable range and heightening the danger during hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Shares of Spirit Airlines plunged by 39% after the company issued a warning of "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operations for the next year. The budget carrier cited persistent adverse market conditions, including weak demand for domestic leisure travel, just months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite restructuring efforts and securing new financing, the airline is struggling with profitability and high operational costs. The company stated it may need to sell aircraft and real estate to generate more liquidity to sustain its business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., initiated by President Trump, resulted in 23 arrests on its first day, including a suspect wanted for murder. The operation involves federal agencies like the FBI supporting local police, following Trump's move to federalize the city's police department and activate National Guard troops. While supporters claim the effort is necessary to restore safety, local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have criticized the move as an "unsettling and unprecedented" federal overreach. The initiative has become a flashpoint in the debate over local control and federal power.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed that inflation held steady at an annual rate of 2.7%, slightly cooler than the 2.8% economists had anticipated. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to a five-month high of 3.1%, indicating persistent underlying price pressures. Food costs continued to be a major concern for consumers, with groceries up 2.2% over the past year. The mixed data fuels ongoing debate about a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

This agricultural challenge is leading to higher prices for consumers, with yellow peaches costing 23 cents more per pound.

          <p>Hundreds of workers, labor organizers, and immigrant advocates gathered in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park to protest the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in the city. The protest, organized by groups like the SEIU, called for an end to the raids and the release of detained immigrants, arguing the enforcement actions create a climate of terror for working people. The park has become a symbolic site after federal agents staged a large-scale operation there in July. The event also included a call to boycott major companies that protesters say are not protecting their immigrant employees.</p>

          <p>The White House has informed the Smithsonian Institution that it will conduct a comprehensive review of eight of its museums to ensure their exhibitions align with President Trump's directive to celebrate "American exceptionalism." According to a letter, the review aims to "remove divisive or partisan narratives" and restore confidence in cultural institutions. This move has raised significant concerns about political interference with the scholarly and curatorial independence of the nation's premier museums, which are tasked with the factual presentation of history. The review is set to begin ahead of America's 250th anniversary.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Russian President Putin are set to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, a location with historical significance as it was purchased by the U.S. from Russia in 1867. The summit's primary focus is the war in Ukraine, but Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is not expected to attend, fueling European fears of a deal being struck without Kyiv's input. The White House has sought to manage expectations by framing the meeting as a "listening exercise." However, the high-stakes diplomacy carries the risk of a settlement that could involve territorial concessions from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The ongoing rivalry between Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has intensified, with Musk now threatening legal action against Apple for alleged antitrust violations. Musk claims Apple's App Store unfairly favors OpenAI's ChatGPT over his own xAI's Grok chatbot, making it impossible for others to compete for the top spot. Altman fired back, accusing Musk of hypocrisy and alluding to reports that Musk has manipulated his own platform, X, to benefit his companies. This public spat brings a new dimension to their feud, highlighting intense competition and raising questions about platform neutrality in the AI space.</p>

Despite the positive performance and optimistic forecast, which indicated that revenue growth is constrained only by supply, the market reacted negatively, sending the recently public company's stock downward.

          <p>A federal trial is underway in California testing the legality of President Trump's use of the National Guard for domestic law enforcement, particularly for immigration control in Los Angeles. The state of California argues that the deployment violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from civilian policing, while the Trump administration claims a constitutional exception. The case has become a critical test of the limits of presidential authority, with the outcome potentially setting a precedent for the use of military forces on American streets in other cities.</p>

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has recently suggested that the agency should suspend its monthly jobs reports. Antoni, an economist at the right-wing Heritage Foundation and a longtime critic of the BLS, argued the data is unreliable and that the agency should only release quarterly figures until its methodology is fixed. His nomination, coming shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner over a weak jobs report, has intensified concerns among economists about the potential politicization of the nation's core economic data.</p>

          <p>A paper by Chinese military researchers reveals they are closely studying the electronic warfare tactics used in the Ukraine conflict to draw lessons for their own forces. The analysis focuses on a major engagement where Russia jammed all major satellite navigation systems, including the U.S. GPS, Europe's Galileo, and China's own Beidou system. The subsequent counter-jamming efforts by Western powers have provided Chinese observers with a valuable, real-world case study of electronic combat between major military powers, offering insights into modern warfare techniques.</p>
