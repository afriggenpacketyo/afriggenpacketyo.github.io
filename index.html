          <p>Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, expressed skepticism about a 50-day peace deadline proposed by the U.S., arguing it allows Russia to regroup and inflict more harm. He asserts that Russian President Vladimir Putin only respects force and that Ukraine must become stronger with continued support from its international partners. Klitschko emphasized the urgent need for more advanced weaponry and tougher sanctions to deter further aggression. The mayor described the devastating impact of ongoing attacks on Kyiv, including civilian deaths and widespread destruction, stating that the city's resources for rebuilding are severely limited.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military strike hit the Holy Family Church, the only Catholic church in the Gaza Strip, resulting in at least three deaths and ten injuries, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the targeting of a sacred place and innocent civilians, calling for an immediate end to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the incident, stating that "stray ammunition" hit the church by accident and that Israel is investigating the matter. The church had been sheltering approximately 500 displaced individuals, including both Christians and Muslims.</p>

          <p>The members of the rock band Jane's Addiction are embroiled in a legal battle, with guitarist Dave Navarro and others suing frontman Perry Farrell for $10 million over an alleged assault during a concert. Farrell has countersued, claiming he was the victim of a "yearslong bullying campaign" by his bandmates, which he says created a toxic environment. The onstage fight in September 2024 led to the cancellation of the remainder of their reunion tour and derailed plans for a new album. Both sides have released statements accusing the other of instigating the conflict and causing the band's dissolution.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other board members have settled a shareholder lawsuit related to the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The class-action suit, which sought $8 billion, alleged that the company's leadership failed to disclose the risks of user data being misused, thereby violating a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission. The settlement was reached just one day after the trial began, preempting the scheduled testimony of Meta board member Marc Andreessen. Meta declined to comment on the specifics of the settlement, noting the lawsuit was against the directors personally, not the company itself.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve a lawsuit alleging its Peacock streaming service violated consumer protection laws. The legal action stemmed from complaints that the service made it difficult for subscribers to cancel and did not clearly disclose its automatic renewal policies. As part of the settlement, Peacock must make its renewal and cancellation terms more transparent and provide an easy, immediate cancellation method. The payment includes $2 million in civil penalties and $1.5 million to fund the county's consumer protection enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London plans to close half of its station front desks to save money, reducing the number of 24/7 public counters from 37 to just 19 across the city's 32 boroughs. This move breaks a previous pledge to maintain at least one round-the-clock counter in each borough, a commitment made to rebuild public trust. A Met spokesperson cited a significant budget shortfall as the reason, stating that keeping all counters open is no longer sustainable. The force noted that only 5% of crimes were reported at front counters last year, with most Londoners using phone or online services instead.</p>

          <p>A TikTok trend known as "princess treatment" is generating discussion about modern relationship dynamics and expectations. The trend involves women demanding elaborate or chivalrous gestures from their male partners, framing them as the "bare minimum" standard of care. While some participate playfully, others, like influencer Courtney Palmer, advocate for a lifestyle where men handle all interactions and decisions, such as ordering food at restaurants. Critics and relationship experts suggest this trend, while seemingly empowering, may promote passivity in women and create unrealistic, transactional relationship tests rather than fostering genuine connection and mutual respect.</p>

          <p>This article examines the feasibility of debt consolidation for individuals whose primary income is from Social Security. While it is possible to consolidate debt, qualifying for traditional loans can be challenging due to fixed incomes and potentially high debt-to-income ratios. The article outlines several alternatives, including home equity loans for homeowners with good credit, debt management plans through credit counseling agencies, and direct negotiation with creditors for hardship programs. For those with unmanageable debt, debt settlement or, as a last resort, bankruptcy are also presented as potential pathways to financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Connie Francis, a prominent female recording artist of the 1950s and 60s with hits like "Stupid Cupid," has died at the age of 87 following a recent illness. Her career saw a surprising resurgence when her 1962 song "Pretty Little Baby" went viral on TikTok. After achieving global fame, her life was marked by tragedy, including being brutally beaten and sexually assaulted in 1974, which led to a period of reclusion and mental health struggles. She later became a vocal advocate for crime victims and mental health awareness, eventually returning to performing and recording for decades.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and state Democrats are threatening to redraw the state's 52 congressional districts in a bid to gain more seats for their party. This controversial proposal is a direct response to a Republican plan in Texas, backed by Donald Trump, to gerrymander its districts to favor the GOP. While California Democrats believe they could pick up five to seven seats, the move faces significant legal hurdles, as a 2008 state constitutional amendment gave redistricting power to an independent commission. Newsom argues that Democrats must play hardball, but critics call the plan an undemocratic power grab.</p>

Trump has framed the reopening as a symbol of "Law, Order, and JUSTICE." The move has been criticized by Democrats as a wasteful and symbolic gesture at a time when the federal prison system is already under significant strain.

The guidance is based on health concerns related to glycerol, a sweetening agent used in the drinks to create their slushy texture. Ingesting large amounts of glycerol can lead to side effects in young children, including headaches, sickness, and in severe cases, shock or loss of consciousness. The FSA also recommends that children aged seven to ten limit their consumption to no more than one 350ml slushy per day and has called for warning labels at points of sale.</p>

This move allows the pharmaceutical companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the middlemen who typically negotiate drug prices. Analysts suggest this direct-to-consumer model may not negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated to PBMs. The strategy is also seen as a way to build goodwill with the Trump administration amid ongoing scrutiny of drug pricing.

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve by requesting an on-site inspection of its headquarters, following the president's suggestions of financial mismanagement in the building's $2.5 billion renovation. This move comes amid President Trump's repeated public attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates and threats to fire him. The White House budget director confirmed the request, citing "substantial concerns" with how Powell has managed the Fed. This escalation is seen as another attempt by Trump to undermine the central bank's independence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to lower the voting age to 16 has sparked debate over which political parties might benefit. While polls show younger voters currently favor left-leaning parties like Labour and the Greens, the overall impact on a general election is considered uncertain. Pollsters note there is limited data on the 16-17 age group, and voting patterns could shift by the next election. With this demographic making up less than 3% of the eligible population and having historically lower turnout, their influence on a national result is likely to be negligible, though it could be decisive in marginal constituencies.</p>
