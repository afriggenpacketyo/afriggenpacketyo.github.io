          <p>A recent University of Michigan survey reveals that U.S. consumer sentiment has dropped to near-record lows, driven by worries that tariffs will cause inflation to rise. The index fell to 50.8 in May, the second-lowest reading on record. Nearly three-quarters of consumers spontaneously mentioned tariffs as a concern, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding trade policy. Inflation expectations also increased, with year-ahead expectations rising to 7.3% and long-term expectations to 4.6%.</p>

          <p>Kerri Pegg, a prison governor, has been sentenced to nine years in jail for engaging in a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, a drug-dealing gang leader. Pegg, once considered a "rising star" in the Prison Service, helped Saunderson secure day release, violating specific rules for handling such requests. The investigation revealed that Pegg had accepted a Â£12,000 Mercedes C-class car from Saunderson, funded by proceeds from amphetamine sales. Pegg was found guilty of misconduct in public office and possession of criminal property, with evidence showing she lived beyond her means and had undeclared debts, making her vulnerable to corruption.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination with a since-deleted Instagram post featuring the numbers "8647." Trump and his administration interpreted the numbers as a call to "86," or remove, the 47th president. Comey denied the accusation, stating he posted a picture of seashells that he assumed was a political message but removed it upon realizing others associated the numbers with violence. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service opened an investigation into Comey's post.</p>

          <p>According to a New York Times article, a Republican tax plan, championed by Representative Jason Smith, may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, with some taxpayers potentially ending up in a worse financial situation if the bill becomes law. An assessment by the Penn Wharton Budget Model found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year could see their after-tax income fall beginning in 2026 due to proposed spending cuts. By contrast, the top 0.1 percent could gain an average of more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026.</p>

          <p>A man fleeing Santa Barbara County Sheriffâ€™s deputies started a brush fire in El Capitan Canyon Resort. Deputies were initially responding to reports of a "suspect exhibiting odd behavior" when the suspect attempted to escape in a vehicle that became stuck. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Simon Khalili, then fled into a nearby canyon, where he allegedly started the fire while armed with a sword. Khalili was apprehended and booked on suspicion of felony arson, misdemeanor trespassing, brandishing a weapon, and negligent fire setting.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with the total now exceeding 1,000 infections confirmed in at least 30 states. A significant portion of these cases is linked to an outbreak in West Texas, where two children have died. The increase in cases is attributed to declining vaccination rates, with health experts emphasizing that the measles vaccine is highly effective and safe. The largest outbreak is affecting children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.</p>
