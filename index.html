          <p>Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who previously defended former President Joe Biden's mental and physical fitness, conceded that Biden made a mistake in seeking a second term. Khanna acknowledged that while Biden had notable achievements, such as the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, his decision to run again was ill-advised. Khanna also discussed his focus on regaining the House and promoting a working-class economic agenda, which he calls "economic patriotism." He further expressed support for Trump's efforts to achieve peace with Iran and deliver aid to Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced the commencement of “extensive ground operations” throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip. This new phase of the conflict aims to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages and to ultimately dismantle the group or force its surrender. Israeli warplanes have been conducting heavy strikes in Gaza to prepare for the expanded ground operations. Palestinian officials report that many civilians, including children, have been killed. The expansion occurs amidst indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Doha.</p>

Rubio, however, cited an FBI assessment supporting his view that the gang is used by the Venezuelan regime to destabilize other countries.
