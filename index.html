          <p>Jim Agresti, president of Just Facts, challenges Democratic criticisms of President Trump's "big beautiful bill," arguing that claims of Medicaid cuts harming the poor are unfounded. He asserts the bill targets illegal immigrants and fraudsters, aiming to bring people out of poverty by incentivizing work. Agresti refutes claims that the bill raises copayments for those below the poverty line, explaining it reduces the maximum copayment for those above it. He also points out the potential for waste in the current system where people can access medical services without any copayment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intervening to keep two Michigan coal plants open, a move opposed by state officials and utilities. The Department of Energy has ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain open past its closure date, and is expected to extend the life of the Monroe power plant. Opponents argue the order is costly, lacks local support, and contradicts Michigan's clean energy goals, as the plants contribute significantly to the state's greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. Consumers Energy stated they do not need the Campbell plant to meet energy demands, and the state's attorney general may sue over the decision.</p>

The author expects their own job to be automated in the near future and notes that entry-level hiring in fields like law is contracting.

          <p>States are increasingly offering tax breaks to attract data centers, resulting in significant losses in tax revenue, with beneficiaries including tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. These tax exemptions, intended to spur economic growth, are questioned by watchdog groups due to the limited job creation associated with data centers and their immense energy consumption. A CNBC analysis reveals that many states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions, with billions of dollars already awarded. While some argue that attracting data centers generates economic benefits, others contend that the tax breaks disproportionately favor large corporations at the expense of taxpayers.

          <p>Experts express concerns that the US is less prepared for a pandemic under the Trump administration compared to before 2020. They cite controversial dismissals at health agencies, lackluster responses to outbreaks, and reduced public health resources as contributing factors. Concerns include a lack of reliable information, weakened virus monitoring, and public health cuts. The H5N1 outbreak is cited as an example of incomplete information and reduced testing, while immigration policies may hinder case detection and treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims that Gen Z is becoming increasingly conservative, data suggests that young adults have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold broadly conservative views. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate in 2024, they remain more liberal than previous generations on many issues. The shift may be due to dissatisfaction with the economy or a generalized pessimism, leading to a desire to "vote the bastards out" regardless of party affiliation. This suggests that the 2024 election may have been an anomaly rather than a lasting ideological realignment.</p>

The author suggests liberals may need to scale back ambitions and focus on regulatory policy, but argues that expanding the safety net remains a moral imperative. Democrats must build the electoral power and political will necessary for raising taxes on the middle class. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, Caregiving, examines the historical context behind the lack of resources and support for family caregivers in the United States. The film traces the evolution of caregiving policies, from early 20th-century almshouses to the limitations of Medicare and Medicaid. It highlights the absence of a comprehensive public support system for long-term care, leaving caregivers largely on their own. The documentary also features activists working to bring caregiving back into the public conversation and advocate for policy changes.</p>
