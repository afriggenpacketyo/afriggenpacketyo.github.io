          <p>Kemi Badenoch has denied any discord with Robert Jenrick regarding his remarks about forming a coalition with Reform UK, despite leaked recordings suggesting Jenrick's desire for a united front against Labour. Badenoch's spokesperson clarified that there would be no electoral pact with Reform, emphasizing that Jenrick aims to defeat the party and unite center-right voters. The spokesperson also defended Jenrick's right to speak on matters advancing the Conservative Party. The controversy arose after Jenrick's comments about the need for unity to prevent a Labour victory in the next general election.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, urging them to refocus on their core missions of promoting global monetary cooperation and financial stability.

His remarks came a day after the IMF warned that Trump's tariffs would negatively impact the U.S. and global economies.

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois announced his retirement from the Senate after serving for over four decades in Congress, stating it was time to "pass the torch." Durbin, who has served as the Senate's No. 2 Democrat since 2004, will leave a void in Democratic leadership. His departure sets up a contentious race among Illinois Democrats to fill the seat in a solidly blue state.

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to a level between 50% and 65%, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. This potential reduction, from the current 145%, helped lift U.S. equities markets. Several options are under review, including a tiered system that would distinguish between strategic and non-strategic goods. One proposal mirrors a framework suggested by the House Select Committee on China, imposing lower tariffs on non-strategic goods and higher tariffs on strategic goods.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the underutilization of buprenorphine, a medication that can significantly reduce overdose deaths among those struggling with opioid addiction. Despite its effectiveness, buprenorphine is often stigmatized and faces barriers to access due to a narrow definition of sobriety in the U.S. and fear of abuse. The article highlights personal stories of individuals impacted by opioid addiction, including the contrasting experiences of a woman who found success with buprenorphine and her brother who tragically died after being forced to discontinue the medication.</p>

This imbalance could deepen the gap between U.S. revenue from travel and tourism services and American spending abroad.

The author argues that the anti-abortion movement has always been a fetal-personhood movement, but has become increasingly punitive and unconcerned with public opinion, shifting away from democratic norms and towards relying on the courts to achieve its goals.</p>
