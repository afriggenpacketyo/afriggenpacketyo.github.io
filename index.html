          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew approximately 2 million fans. The police worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community, aiming to radicalize and recruit teenagers for attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. The concert, funded by the city to revitalize the economy, was a major event, expected to generate around $106 million. Lady Gaga's performance was also intended to promote her upcoming "Mayhem Ball" tour, showcasing songs from her latest album.

          <p>Retired NFL writer Peter King criticized Bill Belichick's recent public relations campaign, particularly his book tour, stating that it has been "embarrassing" for someone of Belichick's stature. King pointed to Belichick's appearance on CBS with a hole in his sweatshirt as an example of his poor presentation, contrasting it with paparazzi photos of Belichick in a tailored suit. Belichick responded by defending his girlfriend and accusing CBS of selectively editing the interview to create a "false narrative." CBS, however, stood by its interview, stating that there were no preconditions or limitations to the conversation.</p>

          <p>Active management is experiencing a resurgence in a market historically dominated by index funds, as evidenced by recent ETF trends where active equity ETFs saw inflows while index funds experienced outflows. Investing experts suggest this shift could reshape the ETF landscape, with a record number of new ETFs launching this year, rivaling the total number of index ETFs. While active ETFs still represent a smaller portion of total ETF market assets, they've captured a significant share of investor flows this year. Experts emphasize the importance of investors not overreacting to short-term market swings and staying invested for long-term gains, regardless of their preferred investment approach.

          <p>Dozens of US arts organizations have received notices of grant terminations following President Trump's proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and other arts-related agencies. The NEA cited updated grant-making priorities, focusing on projects that align with the president's vision, such as celebrating American independence, fostering AI competency, and supporting military veterans. The proposed budget cuts have sparked outrage among Democrats and arts unions, who warn of the disastrous impact on public access to creative expression, particularly affecting smaller arts organizations that rely on NEA grants for survival and attracting private funding.</p>

          <p>Survivors of sexual assault gangs have criticized Labour minister Lucy Powell for referring to the issue as a “dog whistle,” accusing her of dismissing their experiences.

The comments have sparked controversy, with calls for a statutory inquiry into the historical sexual abuse of children by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani heritage. While Powell apologized, stating she was challenging political point-scoring rather than the issue itself, the incident highlights ongoing tensions and debates surrounding the handling of such cases.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This phrase creates insecurity and undermines a partner's sense of worth, suggesting they are inadequate. It often stems from a deeper issue: the fear of openly expressing needs. The psychologist recommends clear, direct communication without shame or comparison as a healthier approach to addressing relationship issues, fostering security and emotional closeness.</p>
