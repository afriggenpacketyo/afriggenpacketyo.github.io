        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Across various commercial hubs in Africa, traders are progressively using China's yuan instead of the U.S. dollar for international transactions. This shift has led to the development of informal yuan payment systems to facilitate trade with China. Logistics companies are playing a crucial role by offering Kenyan Shilling-yuan conversion services, allowing traders to pay in local currency while the firms handle the yuan payments to Chinese sellers. This system streamlines the import process and strengthens economic ties between Africa and China. The trend indicates a move towards diversifying financial dependencies in Africa.

          <p>After a hundred days in office, Donald Trump is experiencing a decline in popularity due to a faltering economy and controversial policies. New data indicates the economy is shrinking, and opinion polls show historically low approval ratings. Trump's trade war has rattled allies, while his immigration policies face legal challenges. Despite initial momentum, Trump's aggressive tactics have created widespread opposition, and some voters express concerns about rising food prices and potential supply chain disruptions. The article suggests Trump's initial invincibility is waning as political gravity takes hold.</p>

          <p>Ivan Sarancha, an 18-year-old, fled Russian-occupied Luhansk to seek freedom in Ukraine, becoming a media sensation and inspiring a war-weary nation. Sarancha grew up under Russian influence and propaganda, but after the full-scale invasion, he developed critical thinking and sought to escape. He carefully planned his escape, even creating a pro-Russian persona on a new phone to pass through Russian checkpoints. Now in Kyiv, he speaks Ukrainian as a matter of principle and hopes his story inspires other Ukrainians living in occupied territories, with plans to become a sculptor.

          <p>President Trump's policies played an indirect role in Australia's recent election, bolstering Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs and policies influenced voters. The conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was even nicknamed "Temu Trump" for echoing some of Trump's ideas. Australians were alarmed by the market fluctuations resulting from Trump's policy announcements and ultimately rejected Dutton's campaign, leading to a significant victory for Albanese and the Labor Party. This New York Times article suggests a broader trend of international skepticism towards Trump's brand of politics.</p>

The decision was ultimately scrapped due to fears that it would draw further attention to his age. This detail is revealed in an upcoming book, shedding light on the internal discussions and anxieties surrounding Biden's capacity to serve a second term, particularly after a special counsel report described him as an elderly man with a poor memory.</p>

          <p>Shabbos Kestenbaum, a 26-year-old Orthodox Jew, has become a prominent figure in the Republican-led campaign against antisemitism at top universities, particularly Harvard. After experiencing what he describes as a hostile environment during his time at Harvard Divinity School, Kestenbaum has taken his concerns to the courts and the White House. His activism has gained traction among those who feel that universities have become bastions of anti-Jewish sentiment, with Mr. Kestenbaum receiving support from wealthy patrons and conservative organizations. The New York Times article explores his journey from a Democrat to a conservative activist and his impact on the debate surrounding antisemitism on college campuses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has cut over $800 million in funding for LGBTQ+ health research, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affecting this community. The administration justified these cuts by citing concerns over ideological bias and the use of “unscientific” categories like gender identity. This has led to the termination of numerous research projects and the loss of jobs, drawing criticism from scientists who argue that the cuts create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address critical health issues within the LGBTQ+ community.

          <p>With America facing a housing shortage, some are exploring innovative ways to repurpose existing single-family homes into multifamily units. Developer Monte Anderson is converting a ranch-style house into four studio apartments, a concept he calls the "roommate house," to provide more affordable housing options. This approach aims to address the mismatch between large homes and smaller households while avoiding the disruption of building new apartment complexes. The New York Times article examines this trend and the potential for accessory dwelling units and lot subdivisions to increase housing density in existing neighborhoods.</p>
