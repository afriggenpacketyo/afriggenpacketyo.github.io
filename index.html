          <p>Japan is considering expanding the scope of industries eligible for the Specified Skilled Worker visa to address a severe labor shortage, according to a draft presented to a Liberal Democratic Party committee. The draft proposes increasing eligible industries from 16 to 19, newly including warehouse management, waste disposal, and linen supply. The Specified Skilled Worker visa, created in 2019, allows foreigners to work in industries facing workforce challenges, with two visa types offering different lengths of stay and paths to permanent residency. As of the end of 2024, there were more than 280,000 holders of this visa.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, even with recent reductions. The retailer narrowly missed quarterly sales estimates but beat earnings expectations. Rainey expressed concern that the magnitude of tariff increases is more than any retailer or supplier can absorb. Walmart plans to keep food prices low but faces pressure on items like bananas, avocados, and coffee due to tariffs on countries like Costa Rica and Colombia, while absorbing costs on flowers for Sam's Club on Mother's Day.

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on whether federal judges can block Trump administration policies across the country, potentially reshaping the power of the judicial branch. The dispute stems from an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which was quickly blocked by federal judges. A decision limiting nationwide injunctions could curb the power of federal judges to swiftly block policies and boost executive power. The oral argument may provide hints of where the justices stand on the constitutionality of the executive order, with some justices having previously criticized nationwide injunctions.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy changes and policy is in flux. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is not likely to return anytime soon, even with longer-term inflation expectations largely in line with the Fed's 2% target. Powell suggested that more frequent and persistent supply shocks could pose a difficult challenge for the economy and central banks. He also noted the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation, adding to the complexity of the Fed's policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections from the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that the Interior Department made an error when listing the bird under the Act. This move is seen as prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, as the prairie-chicken's habitat overlaps with these industries. If successful, this could signal that no endangered species is safe, particularly those in fossil fuel-rich areas, and could have negative implications for other threatened species like the dunes sagebrush lizard and the monarch butterfly.</p>

          <p>An anticipated round of Ukraine peace talks in Turkey faced complications as Ukrainian and Russian delegations arrived in different cities, with Presidents Putin and Trump opting to skip the trip. President Zelensky of Ukraine landed in Ankara, while Russia sent mid-level officials to Istanbul, leaving the prospect of direct talks uncertain. Trump stated that a meeting with Putin was necessary for progress, overshadowing the event. The situation reflects differing approaches from Moscow and Kyiv on ending the war, with Russia seeking major concessions before halting fighting.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers approved a referendum to repeal an abortion-rights amendment passed by voters six months prior. The new referendum, which includes exceptions for sexual assault and incest, will be on the ballot in November 2026, or sooner if the governor calls a special election. The measure passed after Republican senators cut off discussion by opposing Democrats, leading to protests in the senate chamber. Lawmakers also repealed provisions guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and cost-of-living increases to the minimum wage.</p>

          <p>This article examines the phenomenon of 'dry texting' among teenagers, which involves subtle changes in texting behavior to signal disapproval or disinterest. Such behaviors, including short replies or leaving someone on read, can create ambiguity and anxiety. The article explores how phones and social media can transform conflicts into quieter, more confusing issues, and discusses the implications for developing conflict resolution skills. While phones can sometimes help resolve conflicts, they also present challenges in handling confrontation as teens mature.</p>

          <p>Germany is backing President Trump's call to increase the defense spending target of NATO members to 5% of their individual gross domestic product. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the result is the 5% demanded by President Trump, that he believes are necessary, and we are following him in this respect. Trump has long demanded higher defense expenses from NATO members, some of which have so far even been failing to meet the existing 2% target. Germany spent around 2% of its GDP on defense in 2024, according to NATO estimates.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner", the chancellor has said, after it grew by more than expected in the first three months of the year. Rachel Reeves told the BBC the 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was "very encouraging", but shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was "a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks". The growth figure was stronger than the 0.6% that had been forecast, and was helped by increases in consumer spending and business investment. The figures mark the period just before the US imposed import tariffs and UK employer taxes increased in April, and analysts warned the strong rate of growth was unlikely to continue.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of this year. This was better than expected, but this level of growth is not predicted to last. The numbers matter because a higher growth rate usually means people are getting paid a little bit more, can spend more and more jobs are created. Before the announcement, experts expected the economy to grow by 0.6% between January and March, compared with the last three months of 2024. The fact the actual number is a tiny bit higher at 0.7% suggests people were willing to spend more than was expected.</p>
