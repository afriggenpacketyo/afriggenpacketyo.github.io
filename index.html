          <p>Analysts predict China's response to new US tariffs will prioritize domestic economic stimulus and strengthening trade ties with other nations, rather than direct tariff retaliation.  China's Ministry of Commerce called for the tariffs' cancellation and vowed unspecified countermeasures, but experts anticipate a focus on bolstering domestic consumption and diversifying export markets.  This strategy reflects China's efforts to mitigate the impact of the tariffs and achieve its economic growth targets.  The broader global trade landscape and China's existing trade relationships will significantly influence the effectiveness of this approach.</p>
