          <h2>West Indies Suffers Historic Batting Collapse Against Australia in Test Match</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 18:31:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia secured a decisive 176-run victory and a series sweep against the West Indies after bowling them out for just 27 runs, the second-lowest total in Test cricket history. The batting collapse in Jamaica marked the worst performance since 1955 and the lowest-ever score for the West Indies. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking six wickets for nine runs, which included the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history. The result left the West Indies captain lamenting the team's recurring and disappointing batting failures throughout the series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has imposed a 17.09% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico following the breakdown of trade negotiations. This move, part of a broader tariff strategy, is intended to protect American tomato farmers from what proponents call unfair trade practices and artificially low pricing from Mexico. Critics, including U.S. companies with operations in Mexico and business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, argue the tariff will increase tomato prices for American consumers and could lead to retaliatory actions from trading partners.

          <p>MasterChef co-host John Torode has publicly stated that he is the individual subject to an upheld allegation of using racist language, which emerged from an inquiry into his colleague Gregg Wallace. In a statement, Torode said the alleged incident occurred in 2018 or 2019, but he has no memory of it and does not believe it happened, while affirming that any racial language is unacceptable. This revelation follows a broader investigation that substantiated 45 allegations against Wallace for inappropriate behavior, prompting a wider discussion about workplace culture within the creative industries.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has publicly broken with Donald Trump on key issues, has accumulated a significant campaign fund of over $1.7 million. Massie's robust fundraising comes as he prepares to face a primary challenge from a new super PAC, Kentucky MAGA, created by top Trump aides to unseat him. Despite being a target for crossing the former president, Massie's financial strength positions him to mount a formidable defense in his district, which spans three expensive television markets. The situation highlights the ongoing political tensions within the Republican party.</p>

Cuomo lost the primary to progressive state assembly member Zohran Mamdani, prompting concern among some moderate Democrats and business leaders. His independent candidacy adds another layer of complexity to the race, which also includes current mayor Eric Adams, who is also running as an independent after a federal indictment, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

          <p>The British government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, proposing that it could eventually be owned by its postmasters. This move toward a mutual or charter model comes as part of a plan to reform the organization's culture in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While any structural change is unlikely before 2030, the government aims to rebuild trust and create a more transparent, stakeholder-led organization. The consultation will also explore future services, particularly banking, as traditional lenders close high-street branches.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who has been a long-time and vocal critic of his. In a social media post, Trump called O'Donnell a "Threat to Humanity," suggesting she should remain in Ireland. This threat is one of the most direct attacks on free speech from the president, who appears to view citizenship as a conditional privilege that can be revoked based on personal animosity. Legal experts note that a president cannot unilaterally strip a native-born American of their citizenship for exercising free speech.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is facing scrutiny from the Trump administration over the escalating cost of its Washington, D.C., building renovations, which has risen from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion. White House officials have criticized the project's expense, calling it the most expensive in D.C. history and describing some elements as ostentatious. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has defended the project, stating many claims are exaggerated and that costs have been driven by unexpected issues and inflation. In response to the criticism, Powell has requested a review of the project by the Fed's inspector general. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's death and the handling of his case files has created significant turmoil within the Trump administration and its supporter base.

The recent Justice Department announcement that no "client list" exists and that Epstein died by suicide has enraged many MAGA followers who were led to expect major revelations.

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 flooding in Texas have been hampered by a renewed flood threat. Officials ordered volunteer crews to suspend searches in Kerr County as heavy rains caused rivers to rise again, creating dangerous conditions. The initial flooding killed at least 130 people, including dozens of children at a summer camp, with about 160 people still reported missing in the region. Authorities are monitoring rising water levels on the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers, warning that the new flooding could be more severe than the initial disaster.</p>

          <p>The high-profile status of Elon Musk played a significant role during jury selection for a federal trial involving a fatal Tesla Autopilot crash in Miami. Several potential jurors expressed strong negative opinions about Musk, stating they would have difficulty remaining impartial in a case involving his company. Lawyers for both Tesla and the plaintiffs had to navigate these biases, with Tesla's attorney acknowledging that it's hard to hear Musk's name without having a strong view. The case, which concerns shared responsibility for the crash, highlights the challenge of finding an impartial jury for a company so closely tied to its controversial CEO.</p>

However, NASA now states it has no legal obligation to do so, effectively burying the authoritative, peer-reviewed assessments on how climate change is impacting the country.

The study notes that these incidents are more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization compared to ingestions of other nicotine products.
