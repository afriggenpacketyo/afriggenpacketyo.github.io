          <p>International pop star Dua Lipa has been granted citizenship by Kosovo, a country to which she has deep connections through her Kosovan-Albanian parents. President Vjosa Osmani described it as an honor, calling Lipa one of the nation's most iconic cultural figures. The singer, who founded a charity and a major music festival in Kosovo, stated the citizenship completes a sense of duality she has always felt. This formal recognition celebrates her ongoing work as a cultural ambassador for the country on a global stage, adding to her existing British and Albanian citizenships.</p>

          <p>A growing number of women are turning to holistic menopause retreats for relief from symptoms like hot flashes, anxiety, and sleep disruption. These programs, such as the M/Power retreat at Canyon Ranch, offer a comprehensive approach combining medical diagnostics, fitness activities like yoga and weight training, and community support. Participants learn about how nutrition, mental health practices, and hormone therapy can effectively manage the transition. This trend reflects a broader movement, particularly among Gen X women, to destigmatize menopause and seek proactive solutions rather than suffering in silence.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is ongoing for a U.S. military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. The suspect, identified as Michael Paul Brown, allegedly fled the scene and is considered armed and dangerous. Authorities have located his getaway vehicle but are now focusing their search on a mountainous area west of the city, advising residents to remain indoors. The bar's owner, who was not present during the attack, told reporters that the suspect knew the victims and believes he may have just "snapped."</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter profits, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. While paper investment gains were much smaller than the previous year, the company's operating earnings saw only a slight decline, with most of its businesses performing well. Berkshire's massive cash reserve remains near a record high at $344.1 billion, as Buffett has struggled to find attractive acquisition deals. The report highlights ongoing challenges for Kraft Heinz and uncertainty surrounding major investments and market valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from Hiroshima University in Japan suggests that a common sweetener could have anti-cancer properties. The study found that when stevia leaf extract is fermented with a specific bacteria, it exhibits enhanced antioxidant activity and is toxic to pancreatic cancer cells in a laboratory setting. While the findings are preliminary and have not been tested in humans, researchers believe the substance is a promising candidate for future pancreatic cancer treatments. Medical experts caution that more research is needed to determine its effectiveness and safety in patients, but see it as an encouraging step in discovering new therapies.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that aligning fitness routines with personality traits may lead to greater enjoyment and adherence. Researchers found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group workouts, while conscientious individuals favor goal-oriented activities like marathon training. People prone to anxiety may benefit from private, one-on-one sessions, whereas those who are open and agreeable enjoy varied and fun options like Zumba or rock climbing.

Combs was found guilty on two counts of transportation for prostitution but was acquitted of more serious charges.

          <p>A new analysis reveals a stark contrast in the amount of rental space $1,500 per month can secure across major U.S. cities. In Manhattan, that budget affords an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it can get a renter 1,329 square feet. The data from RentCafe highlights the extreme housing affordability gap between expensive coastal markets and more affordable cities in the Midwest and South. This disparity is driven by factors like housing demand, zoning laws, and land availability, shaping vastly different living standards for renters nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has surged to €3,248, creating a significant financial burden for many seniors whose pensions are often insufficient to cover the expense. This increase is attributed to rising wages for nursing staff and a higher number of caregivers. With Germany's population aging, the demand for care is expected to grow, placing the nation's long-term care insurance system under immense pressure. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform, as nearly one-third of nursing home residents already rely on welfare to pay for their care.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are introducing a wave of new spicy menu items in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners. Brands like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes, recognizing that younger generations crave bolder and more adventurous flavors. This trend is a low-cost, high-return strategy for restaurants to generate buzz and re-engage consumers amid slower spending. Social media platforms like TikTok are playing a crucial role in popularizing these limited-time offers and driving the demand for heat.</p>

          <p>Unlike global trends of declining religious affiliation, young people in India are reconnecting with spirituality, but on their own terms. India's Gen Z is shown to value religion and prayer, often using spiritual practices as a coping mechanism for mental health and to find solace in a chaotic world. They are personalizing their faith, engaging with it through social media, meditation apps, and spiritual travel rather than strictly adhering to traditional rituals. This modern approach reflects a desire for authentic connection and self-discovery, supported by a political climate that promotes Hindu heritage.</p>

          <p>An article details one woman's debilitating experience with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and difficult-to-diagnose disorder that developed after foot surgery. For months, she endured extreme pain that upended her life before finally receiving a diagnosis. CRPS causes severe, persistent pain that is disproportionate to the initial injury. Her path to managing the condition involved a multi-pronged approach, including specialized physical therapy, medication, and ketamine infusions. While there is no cure, this combination of treatments has significantly improved her functionality and quality of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border. The ruling states that the government cannot use the president's proclamation to ignore laws requiring officials to consider claims from migrants who would face persecution or torture if deported. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be available. The decision represents a partial victory for migrant advocates challenging the administration's hardline immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing that federal agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling affirmed that such practices, observed during sweeps by the Trump administration, likely violate the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed after high-profile raids triggered protests and fear within the region's large Latino community. This legal check reinforces the requirement for reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals.</p>

          <p>Hamilton, Ohio, a town that had been revitalized by immigrant communities over the past two decades, is now gripped by fear due to an aggressive immigration crackdown. The local sheriff, an outspoken hardliner, runs a county jail where the vast majority of detainees are held on immigration charges, generating significant revenue. This enforcement, combined with new authority for local deputies to act as ICE agents, has created deep anxiety among the town's Hispanic and other immigrant groups. The situation highlights the stark contrast between the community's renewal and the threatening policies now impacting its residents.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell is pursuing multiple legal and political avenues to secure her release from a 20-year prison sentence for child sex-trafficking. Her strategy includes an appeal to the Supreme Court, a subpoena negotiation with Congress for immunity, and a potential bid for clemency from the Trump administration. Her recent meeting with the deputy attorney general is seen by experts as part of this broad effort to leverage the political controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump. Legal analysts suggest that while her chances are slim, she has nothing to lose by exploring every possible option for freedom.</p>

The station will allow Namibia to receive and process remote sensing data for applications like environmental monitoring, agriculture, and disaster management. As part of the partnership, China will also provide technical training to Namibian engineers to ensure independent operation of the facility. This project is described as a "shining example" of bilateral cooperation and showcases China's growing influence in helping develop Africa's nascent space industry.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes the U.S. government's decision to deny travel visas to a teenage baseball team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, preventing them from competing in the Senior League World Series. The team had won their regional qualifier but was barred from entering the U.S. under a travel ban proclamation. The author questions the rationale, noting that the proclamation has exemptions for major sporting events and that other Venezuelan teams were granted visas. The piece argues that the decision undermines the spirit of international competition and needlessly demoralizes young athletes.</p>

However, the proposal faces hurdles from member states like Germany, highlighting the bloc's deep division on the issue.
