          <h2>Judge Finds Apple Violated Antitrust Injunction, Refers Case for Possible Criminal Contempt</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction in an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, ordering Apple to cease anticompetitive practices. The judge found that Apple deliberately interfered with competition and that a top Apple executive "outright lied" under oath regarding the company's efforts to evade the injunction. The court documents revealed that Apple executives knew exactly what they were doing and chose the most anticompetitive option. The judge has referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly hesitant to engage in serious trade talks with the United States, preferring to observe which of Donald Trump's advisors will hold the most influence and how other nations will respond to the tariff pause. Sources indicate that internal divisions within the Trump administration regarding trade policy have made Beijing wary of revealing its negotiating position prematurely. Three of Trump’s top trade advisors have divergent views on how to deal with China, creating uncertainty around what Trump’s final call would be. CCTV reported that the US had recently sought to contact the Chinese “through multiple channels” to start trade talks.</p>

Some experts suggest this is a calculated move to manipulate social media, while others believe she is creating a library of memories for her children to understand their heritage.

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested more time to address the US economy, which contracted for the first time in three years, raising concerns of a potential recession. He attributed the downturn to companies stockpiling imports in anticipation of his tariffs, while also highlighting promises of $8 trillion in inward investment aimed at revitalizing American manufacturing. The US economy experienced a 0.3% annual contraction, a significant decline from the previous quarter's 2.4% growth.

          <p>A cybersecurity expert has cautioned against excessive reliance on artificial intelligence for decision-making, citing potential security risks such as hackers exploiting vulnerabilities and data poisoning. Qi Xiangdong, chairman of Qi An Xin, highlighted these concerns at the Digital China Summit, noting that users may become overly dependent on AI-assisted judgment. The warning comes amid a surge in popularity of China's DeepSeek chatbot, with authorities firmly backing the widespread adoption of AI. Qi also mentioned that erroneous information introduced during knowledge base updates could contaminate the model’s learning environment.</p>

          <p>China's C919 passenger plane may face delays in receiving certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), potentially affecting its entry into the European market. EASA executive director Florian Guillermet indicated that certification will not be granted in 2025, with a timeline of three to six years. Despite this setback, analysts anticipate that Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) will continue its efforts to penetrate overseas markets. Since its first commercial flight in May 2023, the C919 has been in regular use on domestic routes, transporting over 1 million passengers as of January 2025.</p>

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board has voted in favor of rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The preliminary vote supports increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent on two-year leases. Tenant advocates argue the increases will exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords claim they are insufficient to cover rising expenses. The final decision is expected within the next two months, amid political pressure from mayoral candidates and debates over the impact on both tenants and property owners.</p>

Park officials emphasize that approaching or feeding wildlife is illegal and advise maintaining a safe distance.
