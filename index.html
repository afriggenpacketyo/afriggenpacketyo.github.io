          <p>The Trump administration's decision to increase the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000 has prompted a global scramble among companies and economies to assess the fallout. While U.S. tech firms, heavily reliant on these visas, face new financial hurdles, other countries view this as a significant opportunity. Nations in Europe and Asia, alongside the U.K., are positioning themselves as more attractive hubs for skilled workers, potentially shifting the global landscape for innovation and top-tier talent away from the United States.

          <p>Climate activist Bill McKibben expresses cautious optimism about the future of clean energy, suggesting its economic viability could help it withstand a hostile Trump administration. He highlights that solar and wind are now the world's cheapest energy sources, creating a powerful market-driven momentum that is difficult to reverse politically. While acknowledging the severe political and environmental challenges that remain, McKibben argues the rapid, cost-effective scaling of renewables provides a tangible, albeit difficult, path forward in mitigating climate change.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are advocating for mandatory health warnings on social media apps to alert young users to mental health risks associated with "addictive algorithms." The proposal also includes a two-hour daily cap on viewing short-form video content, such as TikTok-style clips, for individuals under 18. This initiative aims to address growing concerns about anxiety, sleep disruption, and shortened attention spans linked to excessive phone usage among teenagers, treating the issue as a public health crisis.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has announced a policy to eliminate Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), which grants migrants permanent settled status and access to benefits. Under the proposal, all migrants, including those who currently hold ILR, would be required to reapply for visas every five years under stricter criteria, such as higher salary and English language thresholds. The party claims this would save billions and end an era of cheap foreign labor, though the plan has been dismissed as a "gimmick" by government sources.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at Gatwick Airport, a move the government says will create thousands of jobs and boost economic growth. The project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which is projected to increase flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 per year by the late 2030s. Despite strong opposition from environmental groups citing climate and noise concerns, the government has framed the decision as essential for "getting Britain building again."</p>

Analysts suggest that the ongoing trade war with the United States is a primary driver for this shift, as Chinese companies pivot to the African continent to offset the impact of American tariffs.

          <p>The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has confirmed that a ransomware attack on U.S. software maker Collins Aerospace was responsible for disrupting check-in and boarding systems at several major European airports. The attack, discovered on Friday, affected popular software used by numerous airlines, forcing airports like London Heathrow and Brussels to use manual workarounds and causing continued delays and cancellations. While the recovery process is ongoing, it highlights the significant vulnerability of critical aviation infrastructure to cybercriminals.</p>

          <p>A significant fire broke out in a three-story block of flats in Enfield, north London, resulting in three children being taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation. Approximately 70 firefighters were dispatched to tackle the blaze, which consumed the entire roof and most of the second floor of the building. Fourteen residents had evacuated before the London Fire Brigade arrived, alerted to the danger by a neighbor who noticed the flames in the early morning and began banging on doors.</p>

          <p>Many patients who qualify for 100% financial assistance from hospitals are still receiving substantial medical bills due to significant loopholes in charity care programs. A major issue is that many physicians working in hospitals, such as anesthesiologists and radiologists, are independent contractors and not bound by the hospital's financial aid policies. Additionally, some nonprofit hospitals are narrowing their definition of "medically necessary" care, further limiting the services eligible for discounts and leaving vulnerable patients with unexpected debt.</p>

While Palestine has significant international recognition, it lacks defined borders, a capital, and full control over its territory due to Israeli occupation, making the act largely symbolic but politically potent. The decision reflects growing international frustration over the stalled peace process and the war in Gaza, and it further isolates the U.S. and Israel, who strongly oppose the move.</p>
