          <p>The Starmer government has reversed its decision to means-test the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, a policy that had drawn widespread criticism. The reversal is seen as an attempt to calm nerves within the Labour party and address concerns raised by the public. While some believe the policy was inherently flawed, others suggest it could have been successful with different implementation or messaging. The move highlights potential divisions within the government regarding economic policy and the judgment of key figures.</p>

          <p>West Nile virus has been detected in mosquitoes in the UK for the first time, according to UK health officials. The risk to the general public is considered "very low," and there is no evidence of the virus spreading in the UK. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. Health officials attribute the detection to climate change and the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases to new areas. There have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date.</p>
