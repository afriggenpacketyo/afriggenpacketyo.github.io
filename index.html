The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it occurs as Nvidia navigates U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration's policies have significantly impacted Nvidia's sales to the Chinese market, creating a complex backdrop for the high-profile discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an apparent paradox, South Korea is seeing a surge in demand for fertility treatments even as it grapples with the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in four years, with experts attributing the boom to shifting attitudes where people actively plan for families later in life. While social and financial pressures still discourage many from having children, the trend suggests a persistent desire for parenthood that is now being met with medical assistance, leading to a slight, first-in-nine-years increase in the birth rate.</p>

          <p>Clashes erupted between federal immigration agents and protesters during a large-scale raid at an agricultural farm in Ventura County, California. At least one person was detained as masked federal agents used crowd control measures, including irritants, on onlookers. The incident is part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement in the region under the Trump administration's directive to carry out a mass deportation program. This has heightened tensions and fear in local communities, including in nearby Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel for their roles in the "operational failure" during the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. A new report from the agency acknowledges its accountability for the security lapses that allowed a gunman to fire at the then-candidate. The agency stated it is implementing reforms, including improved technology and better coordination with local law enforcement, to prevent future incidents. The suspensions involve leave without pay ranging from 10 to 42 days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the length of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. The findings indicate that the longest and most extreme heat waves are intensifying most rapidly, meaning even small increments of warming will have a disproportionately large impact. This accelerated duration poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, underscoring an urgent need for societies to adapt more quickly to the changing climate.</p>
