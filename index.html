          <p>Professor Mohd Rizal Arshad, a leading Malaysian robotics scientist, has relocated to China, drawn by its advanced deep-sea science and robust ecosystem for rapidly translating research into industrial applications. He intends to focus on developing underwater prototypes, envisioning the ocean as a critical future source for drinking water, food, minerals, and wave energy. Rizal cited China's strong industry engagement and easy access to components as crucial for innovation, joining Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University. This move highlights China's growing global leadership in marine technology and its capacity to attract international experts, further solidifying its position as a hub for cutting-edge scientific development and underwater exploration.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, which resulted in the deaths of two children and injuries to 17 others, is now being investigated by the FBI as an act of domestic terrorism and an anti-Catholic hate crime. The perpetrator, 23-year-old Robin Westman, died by suicide at the scene after opening fire through the church windows during a morning Mass. Investigators are analyzing a note Westman had scheduled for online publication and exploring the complex motivations behind the attack, while local officials caution against directing hatred towards the transgender community. This devastating incident has deeply impacted the city, leading to widespread mourning and a focused effort to understand its origins and support those affected.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has declared he will boycott the upcoming state banquet for Donald Trump's visit, intending to convey a strong message regarding the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Sir Ed emphasized that while declining a royal invitation goes against his instincts, he feels compelled to act, believing Trump holds significant influence over key regional actors like Israel and Qatar. He argues that Trump has the power to facilitate an end to the suffering and secure the release of hostages. This decision, which has drawn criticism from some as mere "gesture politics," underscores the persistent international calls for decisive action on the conflict and its devastating human cost.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe saw a significant 40% decline in July, marking its seventh consecutive month of decreases, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Conversely, Chinese EV competitor BYD recorded a substantial 225% increase in new registrations for the same period. This shift highlights a challenging landscape for Tesla amidst rising overall battery electric car sales in Europe, suggesting intense competition and potential brand impact from Elon Musk's public rhetoric. Analysts attribute Tesla's struggles to its aging model lineup and management's focus on AI and robotics over core automotive refreshes, as Chinese brands aggressively expand their European market presence.

Officer Simoncic was deploying stop sticks to end a pursuit involving Dennis Mitchell III, who is now charged with capital murder and other offenses, including vehicle theft. The incident began with reports of shots fired, leading to a high-speed chase. Simoncic, a dedicated officer and community volunteer, had graduated from the academy in 2023 and actively read to children. His untimely death represents a profound loss for the Kansas City Police Department and the community he served, coming shortly after another officer's line-of-duty death.</p>

          <p>A massive Russian drone and missile attack targeted Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, killing at least 12 people, including two children, and wounding dozens. The widespread assault, one of the largest in the war, also damaged the building housing the EU delegation to Ukraine, prompting strong condemnation from European Council President Antonio Costa. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of choosing "ballistics instead of the negotiating table," calling for new sanctions and emphasizing the world's need to take a principled stance. This attack underscores the ongoing conflict's brutality and comes amidst struggling US-led peace efforts, with Ukraine seeking concrete security guarantees against future aggression.</p>

Despite Martin's earlier optimistic pronouncements, the team's significant defensive weaknesses were starkly revealed, with the actual score potentially being even higher without key saves. The manager expressed "pain, hurt, embarrassment, humiliation" and apologized, yet his claims of board support contrast sharply with the fervent fan demands for his dismissal. This crushing loss, compounded by recent domestic struggles, signals a deepening crisis at Ibrox and casts serious doubt on the club's current trajectory under Martin's guidance.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities are diligently searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, strongly believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer eight decades ago, after it was prominently featured in a real estate advertisement for a property in Argentina. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was originally part of the extensive collection of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, which was subsequently divided by Nazi officials. The renewed search was triggered when Dutch newspaper reporters identified the artwork in an ad for a villa potentially owned by descendants of the Nazi fugitive, Friedrich Kadgien. A recent police raid on the property uncovered relevant German documents but not the painting itself, underscoring the persistent global efforts to recover stolen cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has incurred a substantial fine of nearly £31,500 ($42,500) for his unsportsmanlike conduct during an extraordinary first-round exit from the tournament. Medvedev's outburst, reportedly sparked by a photographer walking onto the court, involved him smashing a racket against a chair. The penalty includes $30,000 for unsportsmanlike behavior and an additional $12,500 for racket abuse, resulting in the forfeiture of approximately 40% of his first-round prize money. The Russian player had acknowledged the likelihood of a significant punishment, indicating his readiness to face the repercussions of his actions on the court.</p>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player inadvertently entangled in a brutal crime caper in 1998 New York City. Adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, the movie immerses viewers in a "gritty trifle" of a pre-millennial Lower East Side, filled with colorful characters and escalating violence. Hank, a self-loathing alcoholic, navigates a dangerous underworld involving Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, all while being hounded by a persistent NYPD detective. The review praises Aronofsky's affectionate, albeit grimy, portrayal of the city and Butler's performance as a man struggling with his past potential and present failures.</p>

The young assailant was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in detention for attempted murder. A multi-agency review underscored the girl's troubled background and mental health struggles, recommending enhanced information sharing among agencies.

Although a prior agreement reduced reciprocal tariffs on Japanese exports, including automobiles, from 25% to 15%, Japan is still seeking written confirmation for the automobile tariff cut and a "no-stacking" arrangement mirroring that with the EU. Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa cautioned that Japanese exports and industrial production are anticipated to suffer negative impacts from US tariffs, projecting a decline in corporate profits.

These solar-powered robotic lures are engineered to mimic real marsh rabbits by emitting heat, a distinctive smell, and natural movements, specifically designed to attract pythons into monitored pens. Each robot costs approximately $4,000, and this initiative aims to significantly enhance python detection, a challenge given their expert camouflage. This effort represents the latest in a series of attempts, including past uses of live rabbit lures, to manage the tens of thousands of pythons established in the delicate subtropical ecosystem.</p>
