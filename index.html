          <p>Luxury group Kering reported a significant downturn in its second-quarter financial results, falling short of analyst expectations amid ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. The decline was primarily driven by a steep 25% plunge in sales for its flagship brand, Gucci, which constitutes a major portion of the group's revenue. The company acknowledged the disappointing performance, particularly in key markets like China and the U.S., while highlighting ongoing efforts to revitalize its brands and set foundations for future development.

          <p>During his visit to Scotland, Donald Trump held a meeting with First Minister John Swinney at his Balmedie Estate to discuss several key issues. The conversation covered the impact of U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, with Swinney advocating for an exemption for the crucial Scottish export. They also touched upon the taxation of North Sea oil and gas and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Swinney urging Trump to use his influence to push for a ceasefire. The meeting was part of a broader trip that combined business promotions with political discussions.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency plans to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," a critical scientific determination that classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat. This finding is the legal basis for numerous regulations under the Clean Air Act, including emissions standards for vehicles and power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save over a trillion dollars, but critics argue it contradicts scientific consensus, ignores public health benefits, and will face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, Donald Trump's job approval rating has seen a significant decline among young voters aged 18-29, dropping from 55% to 28%. This shift is most pronounced among less partisan and politically unengaged youths, particularly young men. Polling data suggests the decline is linked to perceptions that his policies are worsening their financial situation and that his administration is focusing too much on issues like tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. This trend reverses his improved performance with this demographic in the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>President Faustin-Archange Touadéra of the Central African Republic (CAR) has been nominated by his party to run for a third term, a move enabled by a controversial 2023 referendum. The constitutional changes abolished the two-term limit and extended the presidential mandate, but opposition groups and civil society organizations boycotted the vote, alleging fraud. The opposition is now demanding a national dialogue before the 2025 elections, fearing that Touadéra, who has maintained power with the help of Russian mercenaries, could remain in office for life and undermine the country's democracy.</p>

          <p>The Nuremberg Zoo in Germany has sparked harsh criticism from animal rights groups after it euthanized 12 healthy Guinea baboons. Zoo officials defended the decision, stating that their facility was overcrowded, with the baboon troop having grown from 25 to 40, leading to increased conflict and injuries. They claimed that efforts to transfer the animals or use contraception had failed. Animal rights organizations have condemned the culling as a result of irresponsible breeding policies and have threatened legal action, arguing the zoo violated animal protection laws.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to Scotland, though billed as a private visit, yielded significant political and commercial outcomes. He secured a major trade deal with the EU, hosted UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for diplomatic talks on Gaza, and pressed Russia on a ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump also used the visit to heavily promote his Scottish golf resorts, hosting press conferences at Turnberry. While the trip was largely successful for his agenda, it was also shadowed by ongoing questions regarding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, which followed him across the Atlantic.</p>

The proposal will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for railroad consolidation after past mergers led to significant service disruptions.
