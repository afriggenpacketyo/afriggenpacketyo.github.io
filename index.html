          <p>Donald Trump expressed his disappointment with Elon Musk after the Tesla CEO criticized the tax and spending plan under consideration in the Senate. Trump suggested that Musk's opposition stemmed from the bill's provisions revoking incentives for electric vehicle purchases. Musk refuted Trump's claim, asserting that he was never shown the bill and that it was passed quickly without proper scrutiny. The dispute adds another challenge to the bill's passage, which is already facing scrutiny over its potential impact on the national deficit.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25 basis point interest rate cut, reducing its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Euro zone inflation fell below the ECB's 2% target in May, reaching 1.9%. The ECB now anticipates inflation to average 2% in 2025, a decrease from the March forecast of 2.3%. The decision comes amid increasing uncertainty in the euro zone economy, with concerns over geopolitical tensions and the potential impact of U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>
