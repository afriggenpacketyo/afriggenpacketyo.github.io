          <p>Federal Reserve officials, during their meeting earlier this month, voiced concerns that tariffs could exacerbate inflation, potentially complicating interest rate policy. The minutes from the May 6-7 meeting revealed worries about fiscal and trade policy uncertainties, leading to a decision to maintain steady interest rates. While acknowledging a solid economic growth and a balanced labor market, policymakers emphasized the need for caution until the economic impacts of government policies become clearer. The Fed reiterated its commitment to waiting for further clarity before considering any rate cuts, despite pressure from President Trump to lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the revival of the reality TV show "Duck Dynasty" and its connection to contemporary American cultural politics. The show, which originally aired during the Obama era, focused on a Louisiana family who made their fortune through a duck-call business. The article argues that "Duck Dynasty" foreshadowed the rise of conservative identity politics, representing a traditionalist, Christian lifestyle absent from mainstream pop culture. The revival explores themes of generational change and the family's evolving relationship with fame, reflecting broader shifts in media and culture.</p>

The gift previously sparked criticism due to potential impropriety, especially after Trump's focus on trade deals during his Qatar visit.
