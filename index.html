          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Los Angeles in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to enforce immigration policies, leading to clashes with law enforcement. Demonstrators blocked freeways, set self-driving cars ablaze, and vandalized buildings, prompting police to use tear gas and rubber bullets. Officials, including Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass, criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Chief McDonnell cited the presence of agitators and defended the LAPD's response. The protests, marking the third and most intense day of demonstrations, underscore escalating tensions surrounding immigration enforcement in the region. Optimism surrounding the protests is low, due to the violence and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for selling all possessions in 2017 to invest in Bitcoin, has revamped their security measures following increased kidnapping threats targeting cryptocurrency executives. Didi Taihuttu, the family's patriarch, implemented a hybrid analog-digital system, encrypting and splitting seed phrases, storing them through blockchain encryption or physically hiding them across four continents. This overhaul comes after a series of high-profile kidnappings targeting crypto holders, highlighting the growing need for enhanced security in the cryptocurrency world. The family no longer uses hardware wallets, opting instead for decentralized storage to mitigate risks. The family has shifted to a fully decentralized system, decentralizing not just their finances but their personal risk profile.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery will divide into two publicly traded companies, with one focusing on cable networks like CNN and TNT Sports, and the other on streaming and studios, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television. CEO David Zaslav will lead Streaming & Studios, while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will head Global Networks; the split is expected by mid-2026. The move aims to allow each company to pursue investment opportunities and drive shareholder value, effectively reversing the 2022 merger. Analysts question whether the restructuring will succeed in driving growth amidst the shift to streaming and shrinking broadcast viewership, as legacy networks face poor growth prospects. The market is mixed on whether this split will be beneficial to the company as a whole.</p>

          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf dismissed a controversy over a social media post criticizing an MP's call for a burka ban as a "storm in a teacup." Yusuf, who initially resigned after criticizing MP Sarah Pochin, returned to the party in a different role, leading the Doge unit, which is inspired by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf expressed regret over his post, attributing it to exhaustion, and clarified his views on banning face coverings in public. The incident began when Pochin questioned Prime Minister Starmer about banning the burka, leading to Yusuf's critical response and subsequent resignation before his return to the party. The event shows a divide within the party.</p>

          <p>Mark Gordon, on trial with Constance Marten for the death of their newborn baby, asserted that the prosecution's case was fabricated, comparing it to a movie script. Gordon and Marten deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child, insisting their baby Victoria died of natural causes while camping. Victoria's body was found in a shopping bag in an allotment shed in Brighton in March 2023, but the couple claims she died in a tent in the South Downs in January 2023. Gordon, representing himself after his lawyers withdrew, accused the prosecution of inventing facts to support their narrative, maintaining that they are experienced campers.

The launch comes as Chipotle seeks to rebound from its first same-store sales decline since 2020, attributed to consumer concerns about the economy. The company hopes the new dip will attract cautious diners back to its restaurants, adding a spicier twist to the popular condiment. The addition of the ranch is not guaranteed to improve sales, but the company hopes that it will.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is implementing a strategy to combat rising temperatures by increasing the number of trees, particularly in urban heat island neighborhoods. The city, county, and nonprofits are collaborating to plant more trees, aiming to lower temperatures by at least 10 degrees in affected areas. Research indicates that lower-income neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by heat due to older homes and a lack of tree canopy. The Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab studies the impact of heat on communities and recommends data-driven solutions, including planting drought-tolerant trees to provide shade and cooling. There is some optimism in the program due to the success of the program.</p>

          <p>One of the largest Sikh houses of worship in the US, the Fremont Gurdwara Sahib, is calling for a Department of Justice investigation into the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), alleging it operates as a ‚Äúforeign agent‚Äù for the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Gurdwara claims HAF facilitates meetings between foreign officials and US lawmakers and advocates for the interests of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The HAF denies these claims, asserting it is a non-partisan, independent American charity with no ties to any organization or political parties in the US or abroad. The situation is tense due to accusations of transnational repression against Sikhs outside of India. There is a low optimism score due to the transnational repression.</p>
