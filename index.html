        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions are escalating in Angola's Cabinda exclave due to intensified clashes between the government and separatist groups, with both sides accusing each other of human rights abuses and civilians facing harsh conditions. The separatist group FLEC-FAC alleges systematic revenge attacks by government forces against innocent civilians following separatist operations, claims which the Angolan government denies. Cabinda, rich in oil resources, has been seeking independence from Angola for about 50 years, with local groups citing the region's distinct cultural and historical identity, as well as its geographical separation from Angola. Despite producing a significant portion of Angola's oil revenue, Cabinda's living conditions have deteriorated, leading to calls for independence and improved human rights and environmental protection.</p>

          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at a faster-than-expected annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, despite global economic uncertainties. This growth exceeded economists' forecasts and marked the strongest quarterly growth in the fiscal year 2025, contributing to an overall expansion of 6.5% for the entire fiscal year. Strong domestic consumption and a relatively lower dependence on exports have helped insulate India from the impact of U.S. trade policies. While the U.S. has imposed tariffs on Indian goods, negotiations are underway for a potential trade deal, potentially signaling continued economic cooperation between the two nations (not investment advice).</p>

The goal is to balance promoting both men's and women's games while ensuring a satisfactory experience for the audience.</p>

          <p>The Republican nominee for Virginia governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, is attempting to distance herself from her past hardline anti-abortion stance, declining to state whether she would support abortion restrictions if elected. Her record reveals a history of staunch opposition to abortion, including support for a 15-week ban and statements suggesting women consenting to sex are consenting to pregnancy. With Virginians broadly supporting abortion rights, Earle-Sears' shift in tone may be an attempt to appeal to a wider electorate.

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his role in discovering dark energy, is now questioning the standard model of cosmology, the prevailing theory of the universe's origin, evolution, and fate. Riess's work measuring the expansion rate of the universe has revealed a discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between local measurements and those extrapolated from the early universe. This tension suggests that the standard model may be incomplete or incorrect, potentially requiring a revision of our understanding of dark energy and the universe's ultimate destiny. While some cosmologists remain skeptical, Riess's challenge has sparked debate and renewed interest in alternative cosmological models.</p>

A stronger euro could benefit Europe through lower borrowing costs, protection from exchange rate volatility, and insulation from sanctions. While market watchers are divided on the euro's potential, some see upside as investors seek to diversify away from the dollar (not investment advice).</p>
