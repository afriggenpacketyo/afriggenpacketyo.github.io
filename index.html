          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he claims includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports and significant Indonesian purchases of U.S. goods, including energy and Boeing jets. The deal would reportedly grant U.S. companies full market access with no tariffs on their exports to the Southeast Asian nation. However, Indonesian officials have not yet confirmed these terms, creating uncertainty around the agreement's finality. This follows a similar pattern to a recent trade announcement with Vietnam, where official confirmation has been slow to materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark was involved in a heated verbal confrontation with a referee during a game against the Connecticut Sun, requiring a team assistant to hold her back. Despite her apparent frustration, she avoided a technical foul for the exchange. Clark, who has been recovering from a groin injury, struggled with her shooting but was pivotal in the fourth quarter. She later left the game in tears after appearing to re-injure her groin, raising concerns about her health ahead of the All-Star Game.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of individuals convicted of violent crimes, including murder and sexual assault, to the African nation of Eswatini. These individuals, originally from countries like Cuba, Jamaica, and Vietnam, were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to accept them back. This action is part of a broader, controversial U.S. policy of using third-party countries for deportations, a practice that has faced legal and humanitarian criticism. The administration recently gained a legal victory allowing for expedited deportations to such countries with limited notice.</p>

          <p>A procedural vote on key cryptocurrency legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, initially failed in the House after thirteen Republicans voted with Democrats to block it. Following the unexpected setback, President Trump met with eleven of the holdouts at the White House. He later announced that they had all agreed to reverse their position and would vote to advance the bill. This quick reversal highlights the president's significant influence over the Republican conference and revived the legislative push during the House's "Crypto Week." (not investment advice)</p>

This conflict arose after President Trump was influenced by country singer John Rich's campaign against a proposed TVA gas plant.

Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral, a critical reef-building species, has been lost to warming oceans and disease. By introducing genetic diversity from the tougher Honduran corals, scientists hope the new "Flonduran" hybrids will be better able to survive future marine heatwaves. The first of these crossbred corals were recently planted off the Miami coast, a crucial step in protecting Florida's coastline from storm surge.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to use local currency, preserving foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar, and often acquire the gold at a discount. The trend, adopted by countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines, also supports the domestic mining industry. This shift is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire by central banks to bolster their reserves amid global geopolitical and financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reflected on the "terrifying" volatility of the corporate earnings season, highlighting his own mixed predictions. He expressed satisfaction with his call on Nvidia, whose stock rose after news it could continue selling chips to China. However, he was disappointed by the market's negative reaction to earnings from BlackRock and Wells Fargo. Cramer noted that investors punished BlackRock for lower net inflows and Wells Fargo for cutting its guidance on net interest income. He concluded that while he remains confident in the long-term prospects of all three companies, earnings season can be unforgiving. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to "assistants" to prevent confusion with doctors. The review, commissioned amid safety concerns, also suggests they should not diagnose patients and must wear standardized uniforms and badges for clarity. The recommendations follow cases where patients died after being seen by PAs they believed were doctors. The number of PAs and AAs is planned to grow significantly, making role clarity a critical issue.</p>

Opened in 1848, the Victorian glasshouse's ironwork is rusting due to the internal tropical conditions. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the structure, and moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.</p>

The advert for the drink, which contains magnesium and other supplements, was found to breach rules regarding marketing food with unproven health benefits. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" wrongly implied the drink could treat anxiety, a prohibited claim.

The retrial was granted based on evidence that Kim was tortured during the original investigation, which was conducted under martial law.

A memo from Fannie Mae investigators, cited by Trump, noted a "possible occupancy misrepresentation" but did not accuse Schiff of fraud.
