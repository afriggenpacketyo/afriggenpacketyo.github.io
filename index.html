          <p>The White House criticized Amazon following a report that the company was considering displaying U.S. tariff costs on its product listings, labeling it a "hostile and political act." This criticism came after Punchbowl News reported Amazon's plan, prompting White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to question the timing of such a move. Subsequently, Amazon downplayed the report, stating it was only considered for its budget-focused Amazon Haul section and later clarified that the plan was never approved and would not be implemented. The incident occurred amidst broader tensions between the Trump administration and Jeff Bezos, with Amazon's business facing strain due to the administration's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was found guilty of second-degree murder and domestic battery in the death of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy was found dead in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head in February 2021, initially dispatched as a suicide. Suspicion arose due to inconsistencies at the scene, including a packed duffle bag and freshly laundered towels. The prosecution argued that Dan used a carotid restraint hold, a technique he learned in law enforcement, to kill Kendy after she told him she wanted a divorce, while the defense maintained it was suicide. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to ease the impact of new tariffs on the auto industry, addressing concerns about higher prices and potential sales declines. The changes will allow automakers with US factories to reduce import taxes on foreign parts based on sales volume and price. Parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with North America free trade rules will be exempt from tariffs. This adjustment provides a two-year relief period for businesses to adjust their supply chains.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, one of the accusers of Harvey Weinstein, testified in his retrial, alleging that he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. This testimony is a repeat of her previous testimony from his first #MeToo trial five years ago. Haley is the first of three accusers expected to testify in the retrial, which was ordered after Weinstein's original conviction was overturned. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies all allegations of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after President Trump attempted to remove three of its board members. The CPB argues that the president lacks the authority to remove board members under the law that established the corporation. The lawsuit cites the CPB's status as a private corporation and not a government agency, emphasizing its independence from presidential control. This legal challenge is part of a broader conflict between the Trump administration and public media organizations.</p>

          <p>Amazon denied considering a plan to list tariff costs on its products after a report prompted a backlash from the White House, which called the idea "a hostile and political act." The report suggested Amazon would display tariff charges next to product prices, providing consumers with clarity on the impact of tariffs. However, Amazon stated that the idea was only considered for its Amazon Haul store and was never approved. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Amazon.</p>

          <p>The Liberal party's victory in the Canadian election is being interpreted as a rebuff to Donald Trump's agenda and a rejection of right-wing populism. The election saw the Liberals retain power, albeit possibly as a minority government, under the leadership of Mark Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau. The campaign was heavily influenced by Trump's actions and rhetoric, with the Liberals positioning themselves as defenders of Canadian sovereignty against American aggression. The outcome is seen as a positive sign for those who oppose Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism toward the government's defense of a botched FBI raid in Atlanta, where agents mistakenly raided the wrong house. The agents, using a battering ram and a flash-bang grenade, traumatized a couple and their child. The legal questions involved exceptions to the Federal Tort Claims Act, but justices questioned the agents' discretion and the government's policy. The court seemed inclined to send the case back to lower courts for further review.</p>
