          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is defending his leadership and the government's planned vote on welfare reforms despite significant opposition from within the Labour party. Over 120 Labour backbenchers have signed an amendment to scrap the proposals, potentially leading to an embarrassing defeat for the government. Starmer insists the party is united on reforming the welfare system, dismissing criticism as minor distractions, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has confirmed the vote will proceed as planned. The proposed changes to the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill aim to slow the increase in benefit claimants, but critics argue they will push many into poverty.</p>

She outlined her goals as CDC director, which include restoring public trust, modernizing public health infrastructure, and employing evidence-based rapid decision-making, emphasizing integrity and transparency.</p>

          <p>Shares of Flagstar bank experienced a decline after Zohran Mamdani, a New York City mayoral candidate supporting rent freezes, won the Democratic primary. Mamdani's proposal to freeze rent increases in stabilized units has raised concerns about the profitability of multi-family rental properties, impacting Flagstar due to its significant exposure to New York City real estate. Analysts estimate that a substantial portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is subject to New York rent regulations, potentially affecting the bank's financial performance, though some analysts believe the current rent regulations are already keeping price hikes below the pace of cost increases (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>With credit card debt rising and interest rates high, this article outlines several methods for consumers to pay 0% interest on their credit card debt. Options include transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card, paying the balance in full each month to utilize the grace period, using a 0% APR introductory offer for new purchases with careful planning, enrolling in a credit card hardship program, and requesting a temporary rate reduction. The key is to act quickly and commit to a realistic repayment plan to avoid compounding interest charges (not investment advice).</p>

The investigation, which began in April, uncovered new alleged victims and claims that police missed a crucial lead two decades prior. The BBC investigation led to the arrest of a man over claims by two of the women in the program, as the women had first gone to the police 20 years ago but prosecutors decided not to take the case to court. The man denies the allegations, stating the claims were previously investigated and he was never prosecuted.</p>

          <p>President Trump is doubling down on his claim of "total obliteration" of Iran's nuclear program, challenging an early Pentagon intelligence report that suggested the strikes only set back the program by a few months. Trump claimed that the U.S. has collected additional intelligence and that American pilots were being demeaned by reports questioning the efficacy of the operation. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supported Trump's position, calling reports of limited damage "fake news" and claiming the leak of the preliminary report was politically motivated.</p>
