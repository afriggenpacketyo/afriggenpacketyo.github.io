          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States’ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The attack, a response to the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, did not result in any casualties. President Trump stated that the U.S. had prior warning of the Iranian strike, and Qatari authorities confirmed the missiles were intercepted. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility, stating the attack targeted the U.S. base with a "devastating and powerful missile."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to third countries without additional due process requirements. This decision reverses a lower court order that prevented the administration from deporting migrants to countries other than their origin without giving them a chance to raise fears of torture, persecution, or death. Justice Sotomayor, along with Justices Kagan and Jackson, dissented, accusing her colleagues of condoning "lawless" behavior by the administration.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. While the missiles were intercepted without casualties, security experts suggest potential Iranian responses could include attacks on U.S. military assets across the Middle East, closure of the Strait of Hormuz, or asymmetric warfare involving terror and cyber attacks. The U.S. operates several permanent military bases in the Middle East, including Al Udeid in Qatar and Naval Support Activity Bahrain, making them vulnerable targets for Iran's short-range ballistic missiles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save £5 billion a year by 2030. The welfare reform bill includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The reasoned amendment cites concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show harms they could face. The justices lifted a judicial order that required the government to give migrants set for deportation to so-called “third countries” a “meaningful opportunity” to tell officials they are at risk of torture at their new destination, while a legal challenge plays out. The court’s three liberal justices dissented from the decision, stating that the government is not acting in accordance with the constitution.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell sharply after a missile strike by Iran on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties. U.S. crude oil fell $5.33, or 7.22%, to close at $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed $5.53, or 7.18%, to settle at $71.48. The oil market sell-off suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate after President Donald Trump hit Iran over the weekend.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may deport criminal migrants to countries like South Sudan or Libya, even if those countries are deemed too dangerous for visitors.

Justice Sotomayor dissented, stating that the government is not acting in accordance with basic human rights. The administration said these immigrants were given due process of law because they were convicted of crimes and were given a “final order of removal.”</p>

Additionally, the strikes may make Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapon more likely by ending diplomacy and increasing the regime's sense of insecurity.

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations, a process that is often a major pain point for patients and providers. Dozens of plans under large insurers such as CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Humana, Elevance Health and Blue Cross Blue Shield committed to a series of actions that aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers. Insurers will implement the changes across markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans, benefiting 257 million Americans.</p>
