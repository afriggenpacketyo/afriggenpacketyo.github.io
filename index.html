          <p>An 11-year-old boy from Bracknell has died, becoming the second fatality after a minibus overturned on a motorway slip road near Reading on May 11th.

A six-year-old boy was also killed in the incident, and five other children who were injured have since been discharged from the hospital.

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured on Friday after escaping from the Calico Rock prison in Arkansas nearly two weeks prior. Hardin, who was serving decades-long sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped by disguising himself in an outfit resembling a law enforcement uniform. He was apprehended a short distance from the prison near Moccasin Creek in Izard County, thanks to the efforts of Arkansas law enforcement officers and the U.S. Border Patrol, who used tracking dogs to locate him, ensuring there is no longer an active threat to public safety.</p>

The family had suspected Joseph of abusing Emily, who would sometimes seek help before returning to him, and Adrienne recalled a lunch where she felt her life was in danger from him. Joseph Ferlazzo was later convicted of first-degree murder for shooting and dismembering Emily, and sentenced to 42.5 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Operation Spider's Web, which involved smuggling drones into Russia to target airbases, holds important lessons for China regarding modern warfare and potential conflicts in the Taiwan Strait. Despite lacking long-range missiles, Ukraine's innovative approach demonstrated that even seemingly impenetrable locations are vulnerable in the era of rapidly evolving drone technology. The operation, which involved hiring unwitting drivers to transport drones in modified containers, served as a wake-up call for militaries worldwide, including China, which must now guard against similar infiltration tactics targeting military bases.</p>

          <p>Susan Dominus, after interviewing parents of highly successful children, highlights five key strategies they employed. These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's unique interests, understanding that learning can happen anywhere, cultivating a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than acting as a coach. The parents emphasized the importance of creating a supportive environment where children feel empowered to explore their passions and develop a deep curiosity, shifting the focus from merely encouraging hard work to fostering a love of learning.</p>
