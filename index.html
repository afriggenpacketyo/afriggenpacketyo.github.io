          <p>Kennett, Missouri, a town with strong support for President Trump, is facing the consequences of stricter immigration policies after Carol Hui, a beloved Hong Kong immigrant, was detained. Hui, who has lived in Kennett for 20 years, working as a waitress and cleaning houses, was arrested by immigration officials for overstaying her tourist visa. The detention has sparked outrage among many residents who question how they can support both Carol and Trump's policies. The community has rallied around Hui, organizing fundraisers and prayer vigils to support her family and fight her deportation, showcasing a conflict between national politics and local values. Optimism for her case is mixed, as the government cited a previous sham marriage she engaged in to gain residency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judicial panel has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing tariffs on China and other trading partners, a setback to his trade agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that Trump's use of a 1977 federal economic emergency law to issue the tariffs was unlawful. The court stated that the law does not authorize the president to use tariffs as a tool to protect the United States from economic threats. The White House has sharply criticized the ruling, stating that unfair trade relationships have harmed American communities, and plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended some sales of critical U.S. technologies, including those related to jet engines and semiconductors, to China in response to China's restrictions on exports of critical minerals.

The restrictions are part of a broader review of exports of strategic goods to China, with some licenses for sales to COMAC, a Chinese aerospace manufacturer, being suspended.

The surge in demand for CDS contracts is seen as a hedge against political risk and fiscal policy concerns, particularly the unresolved debt ceiling. While investors are pricing in increased concerns, industry watchers suggest it reflects anxiety about U.S. fiscal policy rather than an expectation of imminent default. The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a tax cut package that could raise the debt ceiling, pending Senate approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative insiders are expressing concerns about Kemi Badenoch's leadership, describing her missteps as a "total disaster" for the party. The criticism stems from the Conservative Party's poor performance in recent local elections and a decline in polling numbers. Badenoch's strategy of delaying policy decisions and focusing on long-term reviews is being questioned, with some arguing it has allowed Reform UK to become the de facto opposition. The Conservative Party is also facing financial challenges and staffing shortages, adding to the concerns about its future.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the U.S. will revoke visas of some Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The move is part of the Trump administration's efforts to address national security concerns and protect U.S. intellectual property. The U.S. will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong, further tightening restrictions on Chinese students studying in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A judge has questioned the constitutionality of the law used to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, who was targeted for deportation by the Trump administration for allegedly impeding its foreign policy. Judge Michael E. Farbiarz found that the use of the foreign policy law in Khalil's detention was likely unconstitutional. However, he declined to release Khalil from an immigration facility in Louisiana, citing new allegations that Khalil had failed to disclose his membership in certain organizations. The judge stated that arbitrary enforcement of the law can be a danger when it veers too far from the standard set down by Congress.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will spend more than £1 billion to develop battlefield technology and establish a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command. The funding, a result of the government's strategic defence review, aims to speed up decision-making on the battlefield and enhance cyber capabilities. The MoD said the new Digital Targeting Web would better connect soldiers with key information, while the Cyber Command would oversee military cyber operations. The extra investment is possible due to the government's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on future employment, suggesting it could be the most important force in both public and private sectors. He referenced concerns that AI could increase unemployment and wipe out entry-level white-collar jobs. While Cramer acknowledged AI could take over undesirable jobs, he noted that many CEOs may want to use AI to reduce costs by firing employees. Cramer urged that it's important to quantify who will be replaced if agentic AI gains prominence and what will change when there is widespread adoption of Nvidia's most advanced chips.
