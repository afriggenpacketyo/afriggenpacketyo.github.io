          <h2>Taiwan More Likely to Face Economic Warfare Than Military Invasion From China, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 18:06:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A congressional hearing revealed that experts believe China is more likely to employ economic warfare or a blockade against Taiwan rather than a full-scale invasion. Mark Montgomery, a retired US rear admiral, testified that Beijing would likely target Taiwan's financial, energy, and telecommunications sectors through cyberattacks to force capitulation. While the US does not recognize Taiwan as independent, it opposes any forceful takeover and remains committed to arming the island. This assessment comes amid growing US concerns about potential Chinese aggression towards Taiwan, with some officials suggesting 2027 as a possible timeframe for action. Relevant context is the increasing military activity by the People's Liberation Army near Taiwan.</p>

          <p>A pregnant Israeli woman was killed in a shooting in the West Bank, an attack praised by Hamas, while her baby was delivered via emergency C-section and is in serious but stable condition, according to the New York Times article. The shooting occurred amid escalating violence in the West Bank, where Israeli forces have intensified raids targeting militant groups, leading to numerous Palestinian casualties and displacements. The slain woman, Tzeela Gez, was en route to a hospital to give birth when the attack occurred. The Israeli military has locked down Palestinian villages near the site of the shooting, and far-right politicians are calling for stronger action against Palestinian militants.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a tattered copy of the Magna Carta, purchased for $27.50 in 1946, is actually a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, according to the article. Researchers David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent authenticated the document by comparing it to other copies and using spectral imaging to reveal faded details. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace, linking it to anti-slavery campaigners. The discovery is particularly relevant now, as Harvard faces scrutiny from the government regarding its autonomy, underscoring the Magna Carta's enduring significance in individual liberty and self-governance.</p>

          <p>The State Department has confirmed that nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran are progressing constructively, with President Trump suggesting that a deal is within reach. While refraining from detailing private negotiations, Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott reiterated Trump's stance that Iran must never possess nuclear weapons and emphasized the president's desire for a diplomatic resolution. Trump, during his Middle East tour, called for Iran to cease sponsoring terror and proxy wars to achieve a deal. An advisor to Iran's supreme leader indicated Tehran's willingness to eliminate enriched uranium stockpiles and accept international supervision in exchange for the immediate lifting of economic sanctions.</p>

Despite investor concerns about the company's debt and the sustainability of AI server demand, Intrator assured that financing remains robust and that CoreWeave can repay lenders within the contract terms. CoreWeave's client list includes Microsoft and Nvidia, and it recently secured a $12 billion five-year deal with OpenAI, followed by an additional $4 billion agreement.</p>

The immigrants still face charges for crossing the border illegally. This decision impacts the so-called New Mexico national defense area, established in April, where US army troops were authorized to detain immigrants entering from Mexico.</p>

Even with a temporary reduction in tariffs on Chinese imports, Rainey stated that the remaining tariffs are still too high for retailers to absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase in the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies.

First, it is a milestone for China’s defense industry. Second, the 1991 Gulf War was a wake-up call for China to modernize the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Third, the aerial fight may have been between the armed forces of Pakistan and India, but it was also the first round of a duel between Chinese and Western weapon systems. Fourth, the reported success of the J-10 fighter jet does not necessarily mean it will always prevail over the French Rafale.</p>

Marco Rubio holds four roles, including secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and acting national security adviser.

Business owners are considering strategies such as cutting cheaper items, contemplating layoffs, and pausing the introduction of new products due to the instability.

          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates have entered into an agreement to develop a 10-mile artificial intelligence campus in Abu Dhabi, marking the largest such project outside of the United States, according to the New York Times article.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, focusing on whether lower court judges have the authority to block presidential orders nationwide. The justices appeared divided over the issue, with the US solicitor general arguing for curtailing lower courts' power and the New Jersey solicitor general warning against creating a chaotic system of citizenship. The case could significantly impact Trump's ability to implement his agenda through executive orders with limited judicial checks, and it is not clear when the court will issue its decision.</p>
