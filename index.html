          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move that aligned with economists' expectations. This decision comes as India faces potential tariff increases from the United States, creating uncertainty for external demand. While noting that global geopolitical tensions have somewhat eased, the RBI maintained its GDP growth forecast for the fiscal year at 6.5%. The bank also revised its inflation forecast downward, which some analysts believe could leave room for a future rate cut later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Lochridge, the former Director of Marine Operations for Oceangate, has spoken out following a U.S. Coast Guard report on the fatal Titan submersible implosion. He revealed that he was fired in 2018 after raising numerous safety concerns about the vessel's experimental carbon fiber hull and other critical components. Lochridge asserts that the tragedy was preventable and criticizes both Oceangate for its disregard for safety and U.S. authorities for failing to act on his early warnings. The Coast Guard report acknowledged that slow handling of his complaint was a missed opportunity for intervention.</p>

          <p>Supporters of the Sheffield Wednesday football club are expressing their frustration and despair over the club's dire financial situation under owner Dejphon Chansiri. Years of mismanagement, including late payments to tax authorities and staff, have led to a crisis that fans describe as mentally exhausting. Many feel Chansiri has destroyed the club's family-like community and are planning protests to pressure him to sell. The crisis has tangible effects, such as the closure of a stadium stand, impacting longtime season ticket-holders and deepening the sense of anger and abandonment.</p>

          <p>In a powerful return from a knee injury, Max Muncy led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy went four-for-five with four RBIs, including two home runs, providing a much-needed spark to the team's recently struggling offense. His performance was a significant boost for the Dodgers, who had experienced a major slump in scoring during the 25 games he missed. The game also saw strong offensive contributions from Teoscar Hernández and a resurgent Mookie Betts, signaling a potential turnaround for the lineup.</p>

Ranchers in the state of Sonora are now forced to sell their cattle at a significant loss within Mexico or diversify into other ventures like beekeeping to survive.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff on Syria, the highest rate for any country, just months after lifting long-standing sanctions. While Syria's trade with the U.S. is minimal, analysts argue the move is a punitive symbolic gesture that threatens the nation's fragile recovery after 13 years of war. Experts suggest the tariff acts as a form of economic leverage, potentially to pressure Syria's new transitional government on political matters like relations with Israel. This policy could further destabilize a country already on the verge of economic collapse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a controversial move, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is canceling $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, claimed the technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses. Health experts have strongly condemned the decision, calling it a dangerous departure from science that saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. They warn this policy shift could leave the U.S. vulnerable and unprepared for future public health crises.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science has revealed the largest annual decline in coral cover on record for parts of the Great Barrier Reef. The devastating loss is primarily due to the most severe and widespread coral bleaching event ever recorded, caused by extreme ocean heat stress driven by climate change. Scientists warn that the reef, a vital and biodiverse ecosystem, is facing a volatile future and may be approaching a tipping point where it can no longer recover between catastrophic bleaching events.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Justice Department's effort to unseal grand jury testimony related to her sex trafficking case. In a court filing, her lawyers argued that releasing the material would be a "broad intrusion into grand jury secrecy" and would violate Maxwell's due process rights while her case is pending appeal before the Supreme Court. The move comes as the DOJ seeks more transparency and some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims have called for the documents to be made public to understand the full scope of the abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists regarding whether to set official targets for household consumption in the nation's upcoming five-year plan. Proponents argue that establishing a benchmark for the household consumption rate—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is essential for boosting domestic demand from its currently low levels. However, other influential thinkers are skeptical, questioning whether such a metric is a practical or effective policy goal for the government to pursue as it plans its long-term economic strategy.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who was sidelined early in the season with a shoulder injury, is showing encouraging signs of a turnaround. He has progressed in his throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and a new two-seam fastball added to his repertoire. After an underwhelming start to his MLB career, the team is hopeful that a healthy Sasaki can become a valuable asset for their postseason push. He could potentially return to the active roster near the end of August, either as a starter or a high-leverage reliever.</p>

Over 1,900 personnel are battling the fire, but much of it is burning in steep, inaccessible terrain.

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to develop a plan to disarm the militant group Hezbollah by the end of the year, ensuring that only state institutions hold weapons.

However, the move faces immediate resistance, as Hezbollah's leadership has stated it will not agree to disarm while facing what it describes as ongoing Israeli aggression.

Despite these challenges, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in future AI revenue growth and the competitiveness of the company's next-generation chips against rivals. (not investment advice)</p>
