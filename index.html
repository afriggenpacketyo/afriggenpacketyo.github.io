          <p>Canada is facing its most significant measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, a figure that significantly exceeds that of the more populous United States. The outbreak is most severe in Alberta and Ontario, with public health officials linking the spread to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Mennonite communities, and rising anti-vaccine sentiment following the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts emphasize that while misinformation is a factor, the core issue is insufficient immunization coverage, which is the only effective way to halt the highly contagious virus. Health authorities believe the actual number of cases is likely much higher than reported.</p>

          <p>The body of a 9-year-old Canadian girl, Melina Frattolin, was discovered in upstate New York after her father had reported her missing and possibly abducted near Lake George. New York State Police are now investigating her death, noting that there are significant "inconsistencies" in the father's timeline and account of the events. Authorities have stated that there is currently no indication an abduction occurred and no broader threat to the public exists. An official news conference is scheduled as the investigation into the tragic circumstances of the girl's death continues, with no charges yet announced.</p>

          <p>Former NFL player and current HUD Secretary Scott Turner has publicly supported President Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to change their name back to the Redskins. Trump had posted on social media urging both the Commanders and MLB's Cleveland Guardians to revert to their previous names, even threatening to block a new stadium deal for the Commanders if they refuse. Turner, who was drafted by and played for the Redskins, stated on X that the president is right and it's time to bring the name back. The team's current ownership has indicated they are moving forward with the Commanders name and are not considering another change.</p>

          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines and conventional wisdom suggesting market volatility, there are numerous positive factors buoying stocks. Strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, have set a positive tone for the current season. Furthermore, President Trump's proposed tax bill contains provisions, such as extending 2017 tax cuts and increasing the child tax credit, that are expected to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy and support consumer spending. Other tailwinds include tax relief for businesses, massive investment in data centers and the electric grid, and a more favorable environment for mergers and acquisitions, all of which could foster significant economic growth.

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that individuals retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless significant action is taken to increase retirement savings. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions, as nearly half of working-age adults are not contributing to a private pension. The analysis reveals stark disparities, with low earners, the self-employed, women, and certain ethnic minorities significantly less likely to be saving adequately for retirement. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy to prevent a widespread decline in retirement security. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority of Americans now disapproving of the policy. The shift in opinion appears linked to a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals, with Hispanic approval of the president notably declining. Concurrently, the poll reveals a strong public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices, as disapproval of Trump's handling of inflation has reached a new high. Views on his new tax legislation are initially negative, with most believing it will primarily benefit the wealthy rather than the middle or working class.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a significant election defeat. Despite the bruising result, which reflects public frustration over rising prices and potential U.S. tariffs, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office. The loss further undermines the coalition's legislative power, as it had already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house. Analysts suggest the outcome could destabilize the government at a critical time for trade negotiations and potentially trigger a leadership challenge within the LDP.</p>

The 6-5 loss was compounded by a significant injury concern for first baseman Freddie Freeman, who left the game with a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch. While initial X-rays were negative, the potential loss of a key offensive player adds to the team's frustration over defensive errors and an inconsistent bullpen.

          <p>A deep-dive analysis reveals that the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now tens of billions over budget and years behind schedule, was troubled by fundamental issues inherent to building major infrastructure in the country. Insiders and reports suggest that an early ambition to build the world's fastest line drove up costs dramatically without proper analysis of trade-offs. Furthermore, the UK's complex planning system and the political necessity of making costly compromises to appease local constituencies added vast expenses and delays. This has led to questions about whether any large-scale project can succeed in a densely populated, democratic nation without systemic reforms.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans to close its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's core scientific research arm that provides the foundational analysis for environmental regulations. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to downsize the federal government and will cut a significant portion of the EPA's staff. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, warning that eliminating the office will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health from hazards like toxic chemicals and pollution. The administration claims the move will help the EPA better focus on its core mission.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Argues Teaching 'Self-Connection' is the Single Most Important Skill for a Child's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the most crucial skill to teach a child for lifelong success is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to dismiss their feelings, undermining their self-trust. Fostering self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This strong sense of self can serve as a powerful buffer against anxiety and protect a child's mental health into adulthood.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded a nonprofit, Better Angels, with the ambitious goal of proving that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer money. With a $300-million investment fund, Miller's organization is bidding on several projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to finance them with a mix of private equity and conventional loans. This model aims to cut the time and cost associated with the traditional, subsidy-reliant system. By demonstrating that developers can achieve market-rate returns on affordable housing, Miller hopes to unleash capitalist forces to address the housing crisis on a larger scale.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in a tragic accident after being pulled into a running MRI machine by the force of its powerful magnet. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room at a facility on Long Island, New York. The machine's magnetic field immediately drew him in, resulting in a fatal "medical episode." This incident serves as a stark reminder of the extreme danger posed by metallic objects near MRI machines, which require strict safety protocols to prevent such events.</p>
