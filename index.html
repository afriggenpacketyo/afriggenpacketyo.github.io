        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store issued a statement addressing widespread criticism of its new logo and rebranding, acknowledging that the company "could've done a better job" communicating the changes. The updated logo removed the "Uncle Herschel" character and "old country store" phrase, leading to accusations of being "generic" and losing its classic American feel, which caused a 7% drop in shares. The company clarified that Uncle Herschel and traditional decor elements will remain, reassuring customers that its core values and hospitality are unchanged. This response aims to mitigate negative public perception and stabilize the brand's image.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was detained by ICE after a check-in, preventing his removal to Uganda. This action follows his mistaken deportation to El Salvador in March and subsequent charges of human smuggling, which his lawyers call "preposterous." The judge raised concerns about the government's alleged attempt to coerce a guilty plea by threatening deportation to a country where he has no ties, emphasizing the importance of due process. Ábrego García's case has become a political flashpoint, with his legal team asserting his constitutional rights are being violated.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump held his first White House meeting with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, where he lauded his "great relationship" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and expressed a desire for future meetings. Despite earlier social media posts criticizing South Korea for alleged "purges" related to a corruption probe, Trump adopted a softer tone during the meeting. Discussions also touched upon the US-South Korean trade deal, with Trump indicating it was finalized despite earlier calls for renegotiation, and Lee seeking lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. The interaction highlighted complex diplomatic and economic ties.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, has pleaded not guilty to four felony charges, including battery with injury to a police officer and resisting arrest. The charges stem from an incident last week in Los Angeles where police responded to reports of a partially naked man wandering the streets, and the artist allegedly charged at officers. Lil Nas X was taken to the hospital for a possible overdose after the event, and his bail was set at $75,000. This legal development comes as he prepares to release his anticipated second studio album, "Dreamboy."</p>

          <p>London's Notting Hill Carnival saw a significant reduction in serious violence this year, with "far fewer" incidents compared to previous years, according to the Metropolitan Police. There were 423 arrests over two days, including two stabbings that did not result in serious injury, a marked improvement from last year's eight stabbings and two fatalities. Met Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this success to the proactive use of live facial recognition, metal detectors, and stop-and-search measures, despite ongoing controversy and criticism from civil liberties groups regarding the deployment of such surveillance technology at the cultural event.</p>

This strategy contrasts with the trend of expensive EVs and acknowledges the global shift towards electric vehicles, particularly in markets like China.

          <p>Los Angeles police are investigating a brutal, unscripted attack by Raja Jackson, son of former UFC champion Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, during a livestreamed wrestling event. Video shows Raja repeatedly punching an opponent, Stuart Smith, after slamming him to the mat. The incident, which left Smith with several broken facial bones and lost teeth, was confirmed by event officials as not being part of the show. Raja's father later stated his son believed he was getting "payback" and had recently suffered a concussion, expressing regret for the situation.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces conducted two consecutive strikes on Gaza's Nasser Hospital, killing 20 people, including five journalists and medical staff, drawing widespread global condemnation. The initial strike was followed minutes later by a second, targeting rescuers and other journalists responding to the scene, a tactic known as a "double-tap." While Israel expressed "deep regret" and launched an investigation, media freedom groups accused the military of intentionally targeting journalists. This incident marks one of the deadliest days for the press in Gaza, with the UN and international leaders calling for an immediate ceasefire and impartial inquiry.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated feature "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved notable box office success with a limited two-day theatrical release of its sing-along version, generating an estimated $16-20 million domestically. While this performance outpaced many re-released films, industry analysts believe it will not fundamentally change Netflix's strategy of prioritizing its streaming service over extensive theatrical runs. The company views such releases as marketing "events" to promote streaming content and avoid costly traditional campaigns. This approach, while sometimes at odds with theater chains, leverages unique deals and favorable terms to boost subscriber engagement and cultural buzz for its platform.</p>

          <p>Following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks, markets are now pricing in a near-certainty of a quarter-percentage-point rate cut in September, causing stocks to rally and Treasury yields to fall. However, uncertainty surrounds the pace of subsequent cuts, with less conviction for an October reduction and only a 33% expectation for three total cuts this year. Experts like Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett express skepticism about a rapid easing cycle, citing ongoing inflation concerns and the economy's resilience. The debate highlights potential policy missteps and the complex interplay between Fed actions, market reactions, and economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at punishing individuals who burn the American flag, alleging such acts incite riots and display contempt for the United States. The order directs the Justice Department to prosecute flag desecration that violates "content-neutral laws" and incites lawless action, despite long-standing Supreme Court precedent protecting flag burning as expressive conduct under the First Amendment. Legal experts assert that the president lacks the authority to overturn these rulings, which were affirmed in cases like Texas v. Johnson.
