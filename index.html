          <p>Irish police are investigating the violent deaths of a mother, father, and their autistic son, Louise, Mark, and Evan O'Connor, discovered at their home in Drumgowna, County Louth. The O'Connor family was well-known and respected, with the parents actively campaigning for better services for autistic people and co-founding a special school. Evan, their son, was adored at his daycare for his bright personality and love for animals. A man in his 30s is currently in custody, and authorities have ruled out further suspects in this tragic homicide. The community is grappling with profound shock and sadness, with leaders and local organizations expressing deep sympathy and offering support to the grieving family.</p>

          <p>A second detainee, Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, has died after being removed from life support, following a sniper attack on a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility last week. The 32-year-old, who leaves behind a wife and four children with a fifth on the way, was one of three detainees wounded in the September 24 assault, which also killed Norlan Guzmán-Fuentes. The shooter, Joshua Jahn, fatally shot himself after the attack, having meticulously planned the assault to incite terror among federal agents, evidenced by engraved anti-ICE messages on bullet rounds. This tragic incident highlights the severe and deadly impact of extremist violence targeting government institutions and their personnel.</p>

          <p>Mohammed Sharwarq, a 32-year-old Syrian migrant, has been sentenced to 16 weeks in jail for multiple assaults on staff and residents at an asylum hotel in Epping, Essex. The attacks, which occurred in August, included striking a cleaner, attempting to punch a head chef, and assaulting two other residents. His defense argued he suffered a mental breakdown stemming from the trauma of fleeing war in Syria in 2011, and he now wishes to return home. The sentencing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, where a sexual assault charge was dropped, emphasizes the challenges faced within asylum accommodations and the legal system's response to such incidents.</p>

          <p>Older film and television actors are demonstrating enduring star power, challenging ageist perceptions in the entertainment industry, as highlighted by the UN International Day of Older Persons. Recent hits like Netflix's "The Thursday Murder Club" and Hulu's "Only Murders in the Building" showcase veteran talents such as Helen Mirren, Ben Kingsley, Steve Martin, and Martin Short. These actors, many in their 70s and 80s, continue to lead popular productions, earning critical acclaim and high viewership. Their continued success underscores the value of experience, wisdom, and comedic timing, proving that age is not a barrier to captivating audiences and driving box office or streaming charts.</p>

          <p>Timor-Leste is poised to become the 11th member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in October, concluding a 14-year application process. This membership is expected to bring significant benefits, including enhanced regional inclusion and economic integration for the young nation, which gained independence in 2002. Despite recent protests over government spending on luxury vehicles, Timor-Leste's democratic credentials were lauded after the government reversed its decision. While some skepticism exists within the Timorese society regarding immediate benefits, the accession is seen as a crucial step for the resource-dependent country to secure its economic and political sovereignty.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to announce an agreement with Pfizer aimed at voluntarily lowering medication prices within Medicaid, aligning with his administration's push to link U.S. drug costs to cheaper international rates. The deal reportedly includes discounted prices in Medicaid and a three-year reprieve on planned pharmaceutical tariffs, provided Pfizer builds manufacturing plants in the U.S. This initiative comes as drugmakers face a presidential deadline to address high drug prices and amid the revival of the "most favored nation" policy. The agreement, which saw Pfizer's shares rise, represents a significant move in the ongoing effort to control pharmaceutical expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are seeking a minimum of 11 years in prison for Sean "Diddy" Combs, following his conviction on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution. Despite his acquittal on more serious charges like sex trafficking, prosecutors argue his "unrepentant" nature and history of violence, particularly against Cassie Ventura, warrant a substantial sentence. They contend the punishment should reflect decades of alleged unchecked violence and the psychological damage inflicted on victims, including Ventura's "bloodied and busied" depiction in hotel security footage.

The Education Department's website states a 65-day notice is sent, but there's no precedent for such a long delay between notice and offset.

          <p>The Federal Unionists Network (FUN) and 35 other unions are urging Democratic congressional leaders to resist Republican budget demands, even if it leads to a government shutdown and halted paychecks for federal workers. The unions, representing tens of thousands of federal employees, are willing to forgo pay to preserve critical public services and ensure appropriated funds are spent. They frame this stance as a fight for economic justice, democracy, and the wellbeing of the people, presenting Democrats with an opportunity to reclaim their base. This solidarity highlights federal workers' transformation from potential "villains" to "heroes" in the budget impasse, challenging the Trump administration's efforts to decimate the civil service.</p>

          <p>China's new K visa program, intended to attract young foreign STEM graduates with streamlined entry, residence, and employment opportunities, is encountering significant domestic criticism. The initiative, aimed at bolstering China's scientific and technological prowess, faces unease from citizens concerned about existing job market competition and immigration fears. Public policy analysts emphasize the need for greater transparency, clearer communication, and strict oversight to mitigate these internal tensions. While the government seeks to enhance its talent pool, the lack of specific details regarding eligibility criteria, coupled with current economic anxieties, is challenging the program's intended positive impact and public acceptance.</p>

          <p>Coffee prices have surged nearly 21% over the past year, reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, impacting coffee chains like Gregory's Coffee. The price hike is attributed to droughts in Brazil, volatile weather in other cultivating regions, and heavy U.S. tariffs, including a 50% levy on Brazilian imports. Gregory's Coffee, a family-owned chain, has absorbed increased costs but anticipates price raises soon, noting that tariffs affect not just beans but also related supplies. Major retailers like J.M. Smucker Co. and Starbucks are also bracing for or planning future price increases, reflecting a challenging economic environment for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats are refusing to pass a short-term funding agreement without overhauls to Medicaid cuts and extensions to healthcare tax credits, which Republicans oppose. If a shutdown occurs, millions of federal employees, including some service members, could work without pay, national parks might close, and critical services like FDA food safety inspections could be disrupted.

Despite initial defiance and threats of secession, Dodik's party, SNSD, ultimately conceded, and he has requested an interim president be appointed.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be in a difficult political position following his agreement to President Trump's Gaza peace deal, which outlines a pathway to a Palestinian state and a role for the Palestinian Authority. This agreement risks alienating his far-right coalition allies, who have threatened to collapse his government if concessions are made. Netanyahu publicly emphasized his rejection of Palestinian statehood, stating Israel would "forcibly resist" it, and reports suggest the cabinet will only vote on hostage-prisoner exchanges, not the full deal. His actions suggest a complex political maneuver to balance international pressure with domestic political survival, potentially banking on Hamas rejecting the deal to continue the war.</p>
