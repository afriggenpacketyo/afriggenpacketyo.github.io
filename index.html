          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles after attempting to ask questions about immigration policies. Padilla, who was already in the federal building for a scheduled briefing, was pushed out of the room, forced to the ground, and handcuffed, although he was not arrested. Following the incident, Padilla expressed concern over the treatment of farmworkers, cooks, and day laborers by the administration, while Noem stated that Padilla's approach was inappropriate and that she wished he had identified himself beforehand. The incident sparked outrage from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who condemned the actions as dictatorial and shameful. The optimism score is a reflection of the gravity of a senator getting manhandled.</p>

          <p>Families hid in attics and wardrobes during violent disorder in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable. The violence, described as "racist thuggery," targeted ethnic minorities and law enforcement, resulting in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests.

The PSNI is working to identify and prosecute those responsible, while community outreach workers are helping affected families find safe shelter.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed legislation seeking to rescind California's ambitious auto emission standards, including a rule that would have effectively banned the sale of new gas-only cars by 2035.
