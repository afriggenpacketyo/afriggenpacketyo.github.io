          <h2>Los Angeles County Approves $4 Billion Settlement for Sexual Assault Claims in Juvenile Facilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 17:25:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles County has approved a $4 billion payout to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual assault in juvenile facilities since 1959, far surpassing previous settlements of this nature. The agreement, approved by the county board of supervisors, addresses lawsuits filed by individuals who allege mistreatment and sexual abuse in foster care and juvenile detention facilities. The claims largely stem from a California law that temporarily suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse victims, allowing them to bring cases forward. County officials have apologized for the reprehensible acts and acknowledged the profound harm inflicted on thousands of children over decades, even though the settlement comes at a time when the county is facing financial constraints.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed several Biden appointees from the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, including Douglas Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris. Emhoff criticized the move, emphasizing that Holocaust remembrance should remain nonpartisan and not be used as a political tool. The White House stated that President Trump intends to appoint individuals who will honor the memory of the Holocaust and be steadfast supporters of Israel. The firings have sparked concern about the politicization of the museum's mission and the importance of confronting antisemitism and hate, with some fearing that Trump is weaponizing concerns about antisemitism for political gain.</p>

          <p>Environmental policy experts are raising concerns about a series of policies enacted by President Trump that could harm the environment. These policies include declaring a national energy emergency, withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement again, and rolling back drilling restrictions on federal lands and waters. Experts note the administration's strategy of overwhelming the environmental community with numerous executive orders and subtle actions that undermine efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainability. The administration also dismissed authors of the Sixth National Climate Assessment report and cut budgets for scientific institutions, raising concerns about the capacity to deliver careful analysis and good science for environmental policy.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock experienced a significant drop after the company announced better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter due to macroeconomic uncertainties. The company cited potential constraints on advertising demand as the reason for withholding guidance, noting that brand-oriented advertising revenue dipped. Snap lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses range and cost guidance for stock-based compensation, while reporting an increase in daily active users and subscribers to its Snapchat+ subscription service.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month. While tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies, such as additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts will still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years. The administration said it calculated those rates by applying a 25% duty to 15% of the value of a U.S.-assembled vehicle in the first year, and a 25% duty to 10% of that value in the second year.</p>

          <p>A study comparing life expectancy of people born from 1900 to 2000 found minimal changes in many southern states, especially for women, while states in the Northeast and West saw significant improvements.

The study attributes these regional discrepancies to variations in state public health policies and socioeconomic factors, such as tobacco regulations, vaccine policies, and access to healthcare.

The union alleges 44 labor law violations by the county, including retaliation and contracting out union jobs, and members are dissatisfied with the county's pay offer. The county, facing financial pressures, is offering a $5,000 bonus and a cost-of-living adjustment, but the union deems this insufficient.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged significantly since the start of 2024, surpassing $3,400 per ounce in April, and experts predict this trend may continue into May. Factors such as domestic economic concerns, stable interest rate policy, and geopolitical tensions are expected to keep gold prices elevated. Investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset during times of stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's expected pause on interest rate cuts and ongoing geopolitical issues further support the potential for continued price increases in the coming month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his controversial trade policies in an ABC News interview, asserting that China "probably will eat those tariffs" and attempting to alleviate economic anxieties. Despite polling indicating concerns about higher costs and market volatility, Trump claimed that he has lowered prices since taking office. When pressed about the impact of 145% tariffs on China, Trump maintained that the Chinese will absorb the costs rather than passing them on to American consumers. He stated that China was "ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off," and asserted that this is no longer the case.</p>

          <p>Starbucks reported weaker-than-expected earnings and another quarter of same-store sales declines, but the company said its turnaround strategy is showing early signs of success. CEO Brian Niccol stated that the company is seeing changes in its coffeehouses and is testing and learning at speed. Despite the financial results not yet reflecting progress, Starbucks' new marketing is resonating with customers, and service speeds are improving. The company's global same-store sales fell 1% in its second quarter, driven by a decline in transactions in the U.S., where transactions fell 4%, dragging its same-store sales down 2%.</p>

Deep-sea minerals have become increasingly sought after as China has dominated the critical-minerals sector for profit and geopolitical benefit.

To improve chances of success, borrowers should understand how debt settlement works, assess their financial situation, and explain their hardship clearly to creditors.
