          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor lacerations after being bitten in waist-deep water at Jones Beach on Long Island, New York. While she did not see the creature, experts believe the bite was likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, and authorities will maintain increased patrols throughout the summer. The event highlights the rarity of such encounters, with officials noting a global average of 64 unprovoked bites annually in recent years.</p>

          <p>In an interview, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi described the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities from recent military strikes as very serious, significantly setting back their capabilities. He stressed the urgent need for inspectors to regain access to verify the remaining material and activities, as Iran has not been fully transparent about its assets. Grossi emphasized that despite the military action, a long-term solution can only be diplomatic and verifiable. He expressed hope for renewed negotiations to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's ongoing nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has claimed that Hamas is offering cash rewards for killing or injuring its aid workers, including American security personnel and local Palestinian staff. This follows a recent deadly attack on GHF workers and alleged attempts by armed operatives to disrupt aid distribution. The organization, which is backed by former President Trump, called on the international community to condemn Hamas's actions. GHF stated that these threats demonstrate Hamas's preference for chaos over providing aid to the people of Gaza.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 81 people and injured over 400 within a 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near a stadium in Gaza City that was sheltering displaced people in tents, resulting in at least 11 deaths, including children. Meanwhile, mediators are reportedly intensifying efforts for a new ceasefire and hostage deal, though negotiations remain stalled. Rallies in Tel Aviv are also pressuring for a deal to release the remaining Israeli hostages.</p>

Upon arrival, the responding officer discovered the animal was actually a deceased hawk, not a large feline cub. The reason for the zoological mix-up remains unclear. The incident serves as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California for unlicensed individuals, a rule reinforced by the federal Big Cat Public Safety Act of 2022.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are working to pass a pivotal 940-page budget bill, which includes extending Trump-era tax cuts and introducing new ones while cutting some welfare programs. The legislation, which narrowly passed the House, faces division within the Republican party over its details, particularly regarding State and Local Tax (Salt) deductions and funding for programs like SNAP. With a self-imposed July 4th deadline looming, leadership is pushing for a vote despite some senators stating they need more time to review the massive bill.

          <p>Following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, descriptions of the damage from the Trump administration have shifted, sparking questions about the mission's success. While President Trump initially claimed the program was "obliterated," intelligence reports suggested a more limited setback of only a few months. Officials later emphasized that "real damage was done" but also acknowledged uncertainty about the fate of Iran's enriched uranium. The administration's focus also shifted to framing the attack's success as achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, rather than complete destruction of nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are using the primary victory of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race as a national political attack line. At conservative gatherings, figures like Donald Trump and Glenn Youngkin have labeled Mamdani a "communist" to paint the broader Democratic party as extremist and out of touch. While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, moderates have been more hesitant. In response to what they call Islamophobic attacks on Mamdani's background, several Democratic lawmakers have condemned the rhetoric and called for unity against such tactics.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by more than half a second. Norris described his lap as "close to perfection" and felt he had regained a level of confidence and connection with the car that had been missing this season. The strong performance comes after McLaren introduced technical upgrades to the car, which appear to have suited Norris's driving style well. His championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri will start third, while rival Max Verstappen of Red Bull had a difficult session, qualifying in seventh.</p>
