          <p>Ozeki Onosato continued his undefeated streak at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, securing a win against Gonoyama and maintaining his bid for yokozuna promotion.

The 21-year-old Hakuoho continued his pursuit of the Emperor's Cup, forcing out Ura in their match.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With NJ Transit engineers on strike, supplemental chartered buses will begin running on Monday from various Park & Ride locations to Manhattan and North Jersey. However, officials have warned that the bus service can only accommodate about 20% of train riders. The contingency plan is similar to one used during the 1983 transit strike, allowing commuters with existing rail tickets to use them on the bus service. Some commuters may also switch to existing bus routes or private carriers. The article describes the strike's potential impact and the alternatives available to commuters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NJ Transit engineers began striking at 12:01 a.m. Friday, shutting down rail service and Metro-North's west of Hudson service, inconveniencing over 300,000 daily commuters. NJ Transit suggests commuters work from home if possible, while the governor considers all options, including a state of emergency. The strike stems from a dispute over pay raises, with the union claiming workers haven't received a raise in five years, and NJ Transit calling the union's demands fiscally irresponsible. NJ Transit has a contingency plan including additional bus service, but it won't take effect until Monday and can only handle about 20% of daily train riders.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by opulent displays and substantial economic pledges. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and the UAE committed to a $1.4 trillion investment framework. These gestures signal the Gulf states' desire to strengthen ties with the U.S. for business, military, and technological partnerships.

          <p>A cross-party group of lawmakers in Japan is urging the Defense Ministry to create an office dedicated to investigating unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), also known as UFOs. The proposal, presented to the defense chief, emphasizes the need to address UAP sightings as realistic and serious national security concerns. The lawmakers suggest modeling the office after the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, calling for regular reports to parliament, public information disclosure, scientific data analysis, and threat identification.

The PLA Daily commentary references a $60 million contract awarded to Gravitics for developing an orbital transport craft, which could deploy multiple maneuverable space vehicles quickly. The commentary suggests the craft could carry up to 10,000kg of payload, including over 150 kinetic kill vehicles.

The film uses a family tree death order structure, linking the Skyview Hotel collapse in 1968 to the freak accidents that plague the protagonist and her family. Tony Todd reprises his role, connecting the film to its predecessors. While existential themes are present, the film mostly revels in the gleefully gory and low-brow thrills that are the hallmark of the franchise.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Auto Tariffs Threaten GM's Future in South Korea</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's 25% tariff on imported cars has ignited concerns about General Motors' future in South Korea. Unlike Hyundai and Kia, GM primarily produces budget SUVs for the U.S. market in South Korea, making it vulnerable to the tariffs. Experts suggest the tariffs could make GM's South Korean operations unsustainable, potentially leading to a withdrawal. The union expresses caution but acknowledges broader concerns about GM's long-term commitment, particularly as the company's 10-year guarantee expires in 2027.</p>

          <p>USC's 2025 commencement ceremony at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum marked a departure from tradition following the previous year's controversy. The university canceled the main ceremony and valedictorian speech in 2024 amid campus protests over the war in Gaza. This year's changes included moving the ceremony to the Coliseum, forgoing a valedictorian speech, and featuring a drone show and fireworks display. While some students missed the traditional campus setting, others appreciated the celebratory atmosphere and the chance to attend an in-person graduation after COVID-19 disruptions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Trump vs. CASA Inc., focusing on whether lower-court federal judges have the power to issue nationwide injunctions. The article argues that lower courts do not have the authority to decide the law of the land, as that power rests with the people. It claims that injunctions should only apply to the named parties in a lawsuit, and that nationwide legal issues should be addressed through class-action lawsuits.

          <p>Scientists at Georgia Tech University have discovered the complex fluid dynamics that enable flamingos' unique feeding behavior. The birds create vortices in the water using their beaks, heads, and feet to stir up and trap prey. The shape of their bill creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water, while their webbed toes create vortices that push food towards their bills. These findings could potentially be adapted to improve water filtration technologies, providing a human application to the natural phenomenon.</p>
