          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and military commanders, prompting retaliatory drone strikes from Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced "Operation Rising Lion," involving airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and the elimination of key Iranian figures, including Hossein Salami, leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones at Israel, which Israel claims to be intercepting with its air defenses. The United States asserted it was not involved in Israel's strikes and urged Iran not to target U.S. interests or personnel, with the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordering personnel to shelter in place. The situation could potentially escalate into a significant conflict between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the core of Iran's nuclear program and killing key figures, including Hossein Salami, chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards. The Israeli military claims Iran launched a counter-attack, which they are working to intercept, and a state of emergency was declared in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation, called Operation Rising Lion, aimed to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's survival. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was not involved with the strikes and did not provide any assistance, prioritizing the protection of American forces in the region. The global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed the Natanz facility had been hit and said it was working with Iranian authorities to assess radiation levels at the site.</p>

          <p>With one year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, organizers are addressing numerous logistical challenges, including transportation, security, and visa issues, as the tournament expands to 48 teams across the US, Mexico, and Canada. Larry Freedman, co-president of the Los Angeles World Cup Organizing Committee, acknowledged the complexity of managing the event, which anticipates over 6 million attendees and 6 billion viewers worldwide. Concerns include potential visa restrictions impacting international fans and the need for expedited processing, compounded by recent civil unrest in Southern California. Despite these challenges, organizers remain optimistic about the economic impact, estimated to exceed $40 billion across the host countries.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland experienced a fourth consecutive night of unrest, with police facing masonry attacks in Portadown, County Armagh. The violence, which began in Ballymena following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, has resulted in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests. Police issued warnings and maintained a heavy presence in Portadown, while Ballymena saw a reduced police presence and no further incidents. The PSNI Chief Constable described the violence as "racist thuggery" targeting ethnic minorities, with reports of families hiding in their homes. The Policing Board Chair Mukesh Sharma condemned the violence as racism and called for an end to the disturbances.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Iran and Israel has transformed from allies to enemies over the past few decades. Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran and Israel were allies, with Israel supporting Iran against Arab states. However, after the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini severed ties and criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Iran's current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maintains a hostile stance, questioning the Holocaust, although some Iranians disagree with this antagonism. Despite this, Iran's reluctance to directly attack Israel has frustrated some supporters of the Islamic Republic.</p>

          <p>Following the imposition of tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has encouraged Chinese exporters to focus on domestic sales using domestic letters of credit (L/Cs). These L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can be used for both physical goods and services, with payment periods generally set at one year. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions by facilitating domestic trade.</p>

          <p>The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), representing German machinery manufacturers, is urging the EU to impose trade barriers to protect against what they consider unfair competition from China. The VDMA argues that Chinese companies receive heavy government subsidies and often disregard European technical regulations, disadvantaging German firms. This marks a significant shift for the industry, which previously lauded the Sino-German economic relationship. The association is calling for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules.</p>

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the attacks aimed to eliminate the Iranian nuclear program, targeting facilities and personnel. The decision to act now stems from Israel's assessment that Iran was nearing the assembly of nuclear weapons, coupled with a perceived weakening of Iran's regional influence after the degradation of Hezbollah. This attack, viewed as a preventive war rather than a preemptive one, carries significant risks but reflects Israel's determination to address what it sees as an existential threat.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Dominican nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, and his sister were arrested following a roof collapse in April that resulted in 236 deaths. Prosecutors accuse the Espaillats of irresponsibility and negligence, alleging they failed to prevent the collapse. A former employee claims he warned Espaillat about the roof's instability prior to the event. The government-appointed committee is still investigating the cause of the collapse, while relatives of survivors have filed lawsuits against Antonio Espaillat. The club was known for its Monday night merengue parties.</p>

          <p>Former NFL star Antonio Brown is facing an attempted murder charge with a firearm in Miami-Dade County, stemming from a May 16 shooting outside a celebrity boxing event.

This charge adds to Brown's growing list of legal troubles, including prior arrests and domestic violence allegations. Brown, who last played in the NFL in 2021, has not publicly responded to the latest charge.</p>

Israel believed that Iran was as debilitated as they were going to be in the region after last year's degradation of Hezbollah in Lebanon, which took away a huge deterrent factor from Israel. Netanyahu felt that now was the time, even if the Americans don't like it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement putting distance between the US and what he called "unilateral action" by their close ally.</p>

He argues that cryptocurrencies move with equities and lack gold's hedging capabilities, making them incomparable.

The Israelis seem to have made the same judgment with respect to Iran that America made in Iraq: A regime that has expressed genocidal intent is trying to gain nuclear weapons; possession of nuclear weapons will mean, with absolute certainty, use of nuclear weapons; and therefore, waiting until the threat gels and becomes obvious is too dangerous.</p>
