          <p>A 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has successfully completed an eight-and-a-half-year challenge to cycle down all 282 of the country's Munros. Sean Green is believed to be only the second person to accomplish this feat, which involves climbing each mountain over 3,000 feet with a bike and then riding down. The semi-professional cyclist and scaffolder described the logistical challenges and time away from his family as the most difficult aspects of the quest. The phenomenon of "Munro bagging" was inspired by Sir Hugh Munro, who first listed the peaks in the late 19th century.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a Florida golf course, is returning to court to argue for his right to fire his lawyers and represent himself. Routh has pleaded not guilty to multiple federal charges, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, following the September incident where he was thwarted by a Secret Service agent. His public defenders have filed a motion to be removed from the case, stating the attorney-client relationship is "irreconcilably broken." The judge has indicated the trial's September start date will not be delayed, regardless of the outcome.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Mexican Nationals Detained in Los Angeles Raids Have Long-Standing U.S. Ties</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles reveals that many Mexican citizens detained in recent immigration raids are long-term U.S. residents. Based on interviews with 330 detainees, the report found 52% had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade, with 36% residing for over 20 years. Furthermore, nearly one-third of those interviewed have U.S.-born children, challenging the perception that they are recent arrivals. The findings highlight the deep community roots of those affected and the significant human cost of these enforcement actions on established families.</p>

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport is reportedly planning to build a dedicated terminal for processing deportations, intended to streamline the repatriation of migrants with rejected asylum claims or criminal convictions. The proposal, which aims for a 2028 completion, has drawn support from conservative politicians but criticism from the Green Party. This development comes as the Central Committee of German Catholics expresses dismay over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, urging the German government to ensure Israel respects international law. The committee highlighted the catastrophic conditions for civilians and the deaths of Palestinians seeking aid.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at preventing the use of "woke AI" in the federal government and positioning the U.S. as a major AI exporter.

The administration argues that such ideologies compromise the truthfulness and accuracy of AI, citing past examples where AI models altered historical images. The new policy prioritizes "truth-seeking" AI models that focus on objectivity and historical accuracy, while also seeking to reduce regulations on private AI development.</p>

          <h2>States Push Back Against Local 'NIMBY' Opposition to Force Affordable Housing Construction</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, state governments are increasingly intervening to compel cities and counties to build more affordable housing, overriding local opposition. In states like Utah, which has seen its median home price soar, lawmakers have passed measures requiring municipalities to adopt strategies for denser, cheaper housing. However, these top-down mandates face significant pushback from local officials and residents, or "NIMBYs," who are concerned about overcrowding, strained infrastructure, and loss of local control. The trend highlights a growing tension between state-level goals for economic accessibility and local community planning preferences.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game proceeded with its usual entertainment, but the absence of its biggest star, Lionel Messi, has intensified discussions about the event's relevance and format. While the game provided a competitive showcase, with the MLS team defeating the Liga MX All-Stars 3-1, Messi's decision to skip the festivities highlighted a potential disconnect between the league's traditions and the priorities of its global superstars. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the issue, suggesting that while the event is commercially important, the league may need to rethink its structure to better align with player needs and a congested global soccer calendar.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a major settlement with the federal government, paying $200 million to resolve investigations into alleged anti-discrimination law violations and an additional $21 million for EEOC probes. The agreement follows the Trump administration's accusations that the university failed to address antisemitism on campus, which led to the withholding of $400 million in federal research grants. As part of the deal, this funding will be restored, and Columbia will implement reforms, including a ban on protest masks and adherence to laws prohibiting race-based admissions, while maintaining its academic independence.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day is sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. This finding presents a more achievable goal for many people than the commonly cited but less evidence-based target of 10,000 steps. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found substantial health benefits at the 7,000-step mark compared to lower activity levels. While most exercise guidelines focus on time, the study's authors suggest a step-count recommendation could be a practical and motivating addition for the public.</p>

Suarez, who had no criminal record, was one of over 250 Venezuelan men accused of gang affiliation and sent to the CECOT prison, where he says he endured constant physical and psychological abuse.

          <p>The Trump administration has instructed U.S. border officials to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This new policy upends a long-standing practice, mandated by a 2008 anti-trafficking law, that required such minors from non-contiguous countries to be transferred to Health and Human Services shelters. Under the new directive, if teens decline the self-deportation option, they will still be sent to the shelter system. The Department of Homeland Security stated the change was enabled by new legal authorities and aims to reunite children with their families more quickly.</p>

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) has cancelled thousands of water tests for harmful pollutants in England's rivers, lakes, and estuaries over the past three months due to severe staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that 10,000 scheduled tests for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates were not conducted at the main laboratory. The cancellations have affected monitoring programs for water industry investigations and protected areas, including the pollution-stricken River Wye. Campaigners and former employees express concern that the regulator's ability to track pollution trends and identify problems is being critically undermined by a lack of resources and low morale.</p>

An oceanographer from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found the creature, which is distinguished by its vibrant purple shell and a bubble raft it creates to float on the open ocean. These snails are usually found in warmer subtropical and tropical waters, and their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore currents. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers will monitor for more sightings if warm water trends continue.</p>

The controversy arose as a Florida judge denied the DOJ's request to unseal grand jury records from Epstein's 2006 case, citing state secrecy laws.

          <p>Following the death of frontman Ozzy Osbourne at age 76, this article reflects on how his band, Black Sabbath, invented the genre of heavy metal. Originating as a blues band in working-class Birmingham, the group pivoted to writing horror-themed music, a stark contrast to the era's peace-and-love ethos. Guitarist Tony Iommi's industrial accident led him to develop a unique, detuned, and heavy guitar sound that became the genre's foundation. Combined with Osbourne's wailing vocals, the band's dark, sludgy, and powerful music on albums like "Paranoid" set the template for countless rock bands to follow.</p>

Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him more active and mentally engaged in the game, rather than solely focusing on his next at-bat.
