          <p>A framework deal has been established between the U.S. and China that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, with technology company Oracle playing a key role in a consortium of firms. The commercial terms have reportedly been agreed upon, though the final structure, including the level of Chinese ownership and control over the algorithm, remains unclear. Presidents Trump and Xi are scheduled to speak on Friday to finalize the arrangement, which comes ahead of a looming deadline for parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. business.</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has announced a £5 billion investment in UK artificial intelligence infrastructure and research over the next two years, signaling confidence in the country's tech sector. The announcement, which precedes a state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, includes the opening of a new $1 billion data center in Hertfordshire. Google executives highlighted the "profound opportunities" in the UK for advanced science and addressed concerns about the energy use of data centers, stating the new facility will be air-cooled and its heat redeployed for community use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The naming of many of China's missiles, including the "Dongfeng" or "east wind" series, was directly inspired by the words of Mao Zedong, the founder of the People's Republic of China. The name Dongfeng came from a 1957 speech in which Mao declared, "Either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind," symbolizing the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism. This practice highlights the deep-seated influence of political and historical rhetoric on the country's modern military identity and its strategic messaging.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are considering the strategic possibility of using two-way star Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher during the playoffs, in addition to his role as a starter. Team executives acknowledged that while the plan is for him to be a starter, unforeseen circumstances in October could lead to him being used out of the bullpen, similar to how other starters have been deployed in crucial late-game situations in past postseasons. This option is complicated by MLB's two-way player rules, which would cause the Dodgers to lose their designated hitter if Ohtani enters as a reliever and is later removed from the mound.</p>

          <p>The president of the University of California system has warned that the federal government's actions against UCLA, including a proposed $1.2 billion fine, are just one part of a wider push targeting all ten UC campuses. President James B. Milliken stated that investigations are underway across the system, covering issues from alleged illegal use of race in admissions to civil rights complaints regarding discrimination. He cautioned that this "looming threat" could lead to significant budget cuts, layoffs, and the loss of federal grants, potentially devastating California's second-largest employer and its mission.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commented on the recent killing of a Dallas motel manager, Chandra Nagamallaiah, blaming the Biden administration's immigration policies for the crime. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, is a Cuban national who was in the U.S. illegally and had a prior arrest history, though not all arrests led to convictions. According to ICE, Cobos-Martinez was under a final deportation order but was released from detention under supervision during the final days of the Biden administration because Cuba would not accept his return due to his criminal record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A final report from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has confirmed that the Eaton fire left significant and lingering lead contamination in the soil of Altadena. The contamination, believed to be from incinerated lead-based paint from older homes, was not completely removed even after cleanup efforts by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Testing revealed that high lead levels persist not only on properties where homes were destroyed but also in the yards of standing homes both within and outside the official burn scar, posing a health risk, particularly to children.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors in a 48-47 vote. Miran's confirmation was fast-tracked, allowing him to participate in the central bank's upcoming interest rate meeting, and has fueled concerns about the Fed's political independence from the Trump administration. Critics have pointed out that Miran plans to take an unpaid leave from his White House role rather than resign, creating a potential conflict of interest as he serves on the supposedly independent board.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn begins, experts in interior design and organization suggest several strategies for effectively decluttering one's home to reduce stress and improve living spaces. The advice includes starting with small, manageable tasks like a single drawer, and planning ahead for where discarded items will go, whether to charity, recycling, or online marketplaces. Experts also recommend prioritizing quality over quantity by keeping items that are genuinely uplifting, and learning to distinguish between nostalgia for the past and true sentimental value in the present to make letting go easier.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance and senior White House aide Stephen Miller have promised to use government power to take action against what they describe as a "domestic terror movement" on the far left. Hosting Kirk's podcast, Vance and Miller blamed left-wing organizations for the assassination, despite the official motive remaining unconfirmed, and vowed to use the Department of Justice and other agencies to "dismantle and destroy these networks." Vance also encouraged the public to confront individuals perceived to be celebrating Kirk's death, including by contacting their employers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order to deploy the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of a task force aimed at combating what the administration describes as rampant crime. This action follows similar deployments in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles and will involve a coalition of federal agencies like the FBI and ICE working alongside local law enforcement. Trump also indicated that other Democrat-run cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and New Orleans, could be next, a move that critics have described as an authoritarian overreach of presidential power.</p>

He asserted that the U.S. is strong enough to act on its own and should not wait for European allies to implement a robust sanctions package against the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering removing some "black box" warnings from menopause hormone therapy medications, which could change how millions of women view the treatment for symptoms like hot flashes. The current warnings, which list risks of stroke, blood clots, and breast cancer, are based on a flawed 2002 study that many doctors now believe overstated the dangers by focusing on older women. More recent research suggests that when started closer to the onset of menopause, the benefits of hormone therapy can outweigh the risks for many, prompting calls for updated and more nuanced safety information.</p>

The family's attorney argues that the city should have known the coach would use his position to groom children and that the failure to act exposed their son and others to preventable harm.</p>
