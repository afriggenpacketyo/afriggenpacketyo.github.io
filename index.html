          <p>A recent Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, tragically killed at least seven children of Dr. Alaa al-Najjar, a pediatrician, with two more presumed dead and her husband critically injured. The incident occurred amidst renewed fighting between Israel and Hamas, escalating airstrikes, and threats of a major ground assault. The Israeli military stated they targeted suspects near their forces but are investigating whether uninvolved civilians were harmed. Dr. al-Najjar's husband occasionally posted social media posts in which he appeared to praise Hamas and the Oct. 7 attacks. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 50,000 deaths in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>An expert in parent-child relationships introduces 'emotionally safe parenting,' a framework focused on emotional attunement, resilience, and open communication. This style encourages parents to accept children's emotions without dismissal, respond without shame, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Key practices include self-reflection, empathetic boundary setting, and repairing disconnections after conflicts. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves and developing emotional resilience by creating a safe space during emotional storms. </p>

Siwar requires a special milk formula because of an allergic reaction, which is scarce due to the war. Her mother, Najwa, reports that Siwar's condition worsened after being discharged from the hospital, as supplies are dwindling. Despite claims from Israeli military body Cogat that there is no food shortage in Gaza, aid agencies report widespread food shortages and malnutrition among young mothers and children.</p>

          <p>A West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration's decision to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs in the armed forces. Parsons objected to Trump wearing his signature MAGA hat while addressing cadets, viewing it as a blurring of the lines between the presidency and personal branding. He stated that West Point was censoring arguments and eliminating courses to align with the administration's ideology, which he saw as indoctrination rather than education. Parsons felt professionally compromised, unable to pursue important questions in his field.</p>

Activities such as collecting fees from a cryptocurrency, brokering overseas real estate deals, and offering access to an exclusive club have generated substantial income. A luxury jet was also donated for Trump's use, raising further concerns. Despite these activities, traditional mechanisms of accountability have been weakened, leading to a normalization of what some consider corruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. federal judges are considering forming their own armed security force due to increasing threats and concerns that the Trump administration is failing to protect them. The proposal involves shifting the U.S. Marshals Service from the Department of Justice to judicial control, fearing Trump might withdraw protection from judges ruling against him. This discussion emerged after Trump's relentless criticism of court rulings against his policies. The move reflects anxieties about the independence of the judiciary under the current administration.</p>
