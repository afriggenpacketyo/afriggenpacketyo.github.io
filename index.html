          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, though it continues to pose a significant threat. The system brought heavy rainfall, with up to six inches expected in some areas, leading to widespread flash flooding concerns across North and South Carolina. In Chatham County, North Carolina, over 100 roads were reported flooded and a highway partially collapsed. While the storm is weakening as it moves northeast, authorities continue to warn of dangerous surf and rip currents along the mid-Atlantic coast.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has dismissed Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, the "America Party," as a 'ridiculous' idea that would only add to political confusion. The move signals a public falling out between the two former allies, with Musk launching the party in response to what he calls the Republican and Democratic "Uniparty." Trump also criticized Musk on social media, stating he was saddened to see the billionaire go 'off the rails.' The spat follows disagreements over a major tax and spending bill that ended tax breaks for electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders from the expanding BRICS group of nations condemned what they termed the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism" and criticized unilateral US tariff policies. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva accused NATO of fueling a global arms race, while the group's joint declaration voiced serious concerns over trade-distorting measures. In response, President Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with what he called the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The summit was notably missing Chinese President Xi Jinping, while Russian President Vladimir Putin attended via videoconference.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has created confusion in global markets by suggesting new tariffs on trading partners could take effect on August 1, despite a previously announced July 9 deadline. President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that letters and deals are being finalized, but the effective date for the new rates would be delayed. This uncertainty caused Asian stock markets to slip, as importers face an extended period of ambiguity. The administration also threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries aligning with the BRICS bloc, further escalating global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa is facing a potential national security crisis after a high-ranking police official accused the country's police minister, Senzo Mchunu, of interfering in probes into political assassinations.

This new technology aims to replicate the human visual system's ability to adjust to varying light conditions and remember those settings for faster future adaptation. The research team states that the system not only improves adaptation speed but also offers faster computation with lower energy consumption compared to current technologies.

          <p>In the wake of flash floods that have killed nearly 80 people in central Texas, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to residents. Local officials stated they had no reason to expect a deluge of such magnitude, with one county judge noting the area lacks a county-administered warning system due to cost. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued Flash Flood Warnings with more than three hours of lead time. However, critics point to potential staffing shortages and the public's desensitization to frequent weather alerts as contributing factors to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, statutory leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the change will give people essential time away from work to grieve without the fear of losing their job. The move, which will provide for at least one week of leave, has been welcomed by campaigners and charities who have long advocated for recognizing the significant impact of pre-24-week pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost educational standards and narrow the attainment gap, the UK government will offer tax-free payments of £4,500 to early years teachers who work in nurseries in disadvantaged areas. The scheme is part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at attracting and retaining qualified staff where they are needed most. The education department noted that only about one in ten nurseries currently employ a specialist early years teacher. The plan also includes an increase in the frequency of Ofsted inspections for nurseries.</p>

          <p>Lena Dunham, creator of the New York-centric series "Girls," has set her latest project, a romantic comedy called "Too Much," in London. The show follows an American woman who moves to the UK and falls for a local musician, mirroring Dunham's own move in 2021. Dunham, who co-wrote the series, explains that she chose not to star in this project partly to avoid the intense body scrutiny she faced during her 20s. She reflects on how society remains deeply fatphobic but feels she has developed a healthier relationship with her body outside of cultural pressures.</p>

          <p>Despite possessing one of baseball's best records, the Los Angeles Dodgers are showing some concerning signs after being swept by the Houston Astros. The team has a mediocre 20-19 record against winning teams, a potential red flag for postseason contention. Furthermore, the team is battling numerous injuries to key players like Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy, straining both the lineup and the pitching rotation. While manager Dave Roberts remains unconcerned publicly, the lopsided losses to Houston have exposed potential vulnerabilities as the team heads toward the All-Star break.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing uncertainty surrounding US tariff policy is compelling companies to radically rethink their global supply chains, with many moving production out of China. An Illinois toymaker, for example, is shifting manufacturing to Vietnam and India to avoid the steep 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, despite the logistical costs and uncertainties of using new factories. Other businesses are also adapting, with some Canadian firms facing a double impact from both US and retaliatory Canadian tariffs. This global realignment highlights the profound and disruptive impact of the current trade climate on international business operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marking the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, King Charles has called for national unity against those who seek to create division. In his message, he condemned the "senseless acts of evil" on July 7, 2005, which killed 52 people and injured over 700 on the city's public transport system. The King praised the courage and compassion shown in the aftermath of the attacks and emphasized the importance of building a society of mutual respect and understanding. Commemorative events are being held in London to remember the victims of the coordinated suicide attacks.</p>

          <p>As the official inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal prepares to release the first part of its final report, victims like Harjinder Butoy are demanding justice. Mr. Butoy, who spent 18 months in prison after being wrongly convicted of theft, is one of thousands of sub-postmasters falsely blamed for financial losses caused by the faulty Horizon software. The report will focus on the human impact and compensation, but many victims say financial redress has been slow and painful. For many, the ultimate goal is to see those responsible for one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice held criminally accountable.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, an analysis reveals a vastly more complex and diverse terrorism threat facing the UK. While counter-terrorism operations have become more sophisticated and well-funded since 2005, the nature of the threat has evolved from organized groups like al-Qaeda to lone-wolf, DIY attacks inspired by online radicalization from both Islamist and far-right ideologies. The state now has a wider suite of powers to disrupt plots and has implemented new public safety measures like Martyn's Law for venues. However, the rapid, unpredictable nature of modern extremism continues to pose a significant challenge to security services.</p>

Superintendent Anna Bearman, then a 23-year-old constable, described the initial call as a suspected fire at King's Cross before the true, sinister nature of the coordinated attacks became clear. She recalls walking a mile into the dark, smoke-filled underground tunnels to carry out the injured, including a person who had lost a lower limb.

Known for its idyllic setting and traditional values, it fostered a powerful network of women known as the "Mystic mafia."

          <p>Nathan's Famous, a hot dog brand deeply embedded in American culture and synonymous with events like the Fourth of July, is ultimately controlled by a Chinese company. The brand is owned by Smithfield Foods, which was acquired in 2013 for $4.7 billion by the Chinese conglomerate WH Group Limited, the world's largest pork processor. While the ownership might surprise some consumers, data shows that Chinese investment in US agricultural land remains relatively small, accounting for less than 1% of all foreign-owned land. This is significantly less than the acreage held by companies from Canada or the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, who was accused of conspiring to bomb a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide, according to his former lawyer. Park died in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, shuttering the only prosecution in the case and deepening the mystery surrounding the attack. The alleged bomber, Guy Bartkus, was killed in the May 17 explosion. Park's death has drawn attention to conditions at the L.A. detention facility, with some lawyers reporting inhumane conditions and a recent Justice Department report finding significant shortcomings in emergency responses at federal prisons.</p>
