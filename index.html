          <h2>US to Impose 50% Tariff on Copper Imports Citing National Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 21:39:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will implement a 50% tariff on all copper imports, effective August 1, following a national security assessment. President Trump emphasized copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and infrastructure, noting it is the second most used material by the Department of Defense. The move caused a spike in U.S. copper prices, with analysts predicting a significant price gap between the U.S. and global markets. Experts warn this could lead to higher consumer costs for a wide range of goods, from cars to appliances, and potentially impact employment in infrastructure projects. (not investment advice)</p>

The phone, which the family believed was destroyed, was discovered in a lost and found on the base by another staff sergeant who made it his mission to return it. After charging the device and finding "Mama Bear" as an emergency contact, he successfully sent it back to her parents.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, an almost three-year low, as the country navigates economic challenges. South Korea's economy saw a slight contraction in the first quarter, influenced by weak construction and slowing exports. The central bank is also grappling with concerns over financial stability, as a recent spike in Seoul housing prices prompted new mortgage lending restrictions. Analysts suggest these measures could pave the way for a rate cut later this year, though the economy faces further uncertainty from potential U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports.

          <p>The U.S. has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, a sharp increase from a previously announced 10% rate, linking the move to Brazil's prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter, President Trump also accused Brazil of "insidious attacks" on U.S. social media companies and free speech, referencing court rulings holding platforms liable for content. Brazilian President Lula da Silva stated that any unilateral tariff increase would be met with reciprocal measures and warned against interference in the country's judicial system. The action marks a significant escalation, using trade policy to address political and legal disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six of its agents in connection with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania last year. The disciplinary actions, which include suspensions ranging from 10 to 42 days, follow an independent review by the Department of Homeland Security that found the agency had become "bureaucratic, complacent, and static." The review identified a series of law enforcement breakdowns that left the then-presidential candidate vulnerable. The shooting incident resulted in the death of a rally attendee, and the shooter was killed on site by Secret Service countersnipers.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has not fully recovered from its sharp decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the virus was the primary cause of the initial drop, drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease are now the main factors holding back a full recovery. The average lifespan in 2024 remains nearly a year shorter than in 2019. The study also highlights significant disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery than white and Asian residents.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against California, challenging state laws that mandate cage-free conditions for egg-laying hens. The administration argues that these animal cruelty laws are preempted by federal regulations and contribute to high egg prices by imposing "unnecessary red tape" on farmers nationwide. California's laws, passed by voters, require more space for hens whose eggs are sold in the state. Supporters, like the Humane Society, contend the laws are crucial for preventing animal cruelty and reducing food safety risks.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated the measure is a "necessary temporary reaction" and a message to smugglers, adding that illegal entrants will be detained. This policy shift reflects the growing pressure on Greece from a key Mediterranean migration route and the challenges European nations face in managing migrant arrivals.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that police are investigating historical sexual abuse allegations against two former members of the Church in Wales clergy, including a recently convicted bishop. The inquiry involves fresh claims against former bishop Anthony Pierce, who was jailed earlier this year for other offenses, as well as a former vicar. Victims have come forward alleging that the Church ignored warnings about Pierce's conduct for decades before he was promoted. The revelations have prompted calls for an independent inquiry into the Church's handling of abuse, adding to a crisis that recently saw the Archbishop of Wales retire over safeguarding concerns.</p>

          <p>UK families are facing significant price hikes for all-inclusive package holidays this summer, with popular destinations like Spain, Cyprus, and Turkey seeing notable increases compared to last year. According to data from TravelSupermarket, the average price for a week in Cyprus has risen by 23%. Travel industry experts attribute the rising costs to a combination of factors, including higher energy bills for hotels, increased food costs, and rising wages in the hospitality sector. In response, some holidaymakers are adapting by booking shorter trips or choosing mid-week travel dates to find more affordable options for their summer getaways. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers in rural Georgia is sparking conflict with local residents who are concerned about the industry's environmental impact. Homeowners have reported issues like disrupted private wells and sediment runoff into local waterways from the massive construction sites. These facilities, which power the internet and AI, are voracious consumers of water, using millions of gallons for cooling their servers. While tech giants like Meta and Amazon state they are committed to being good neighbors and investing in water stewardship, the boom is creating tension between the demands of the digital economy and the preservation of local natural resources.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own proprietary hardware to manage the immense heat generated by next-generation Nvidia AI processors. As demand for powerful GPUs for AI workloads surges, cooling has become a critical challenge. Instead of undertaking lengthy data center retrofits for liquid cooling, AWS developed the "In-Row Heat Exchanger" (IRHX), a solution that can be integrated into existing facilities. This allows AWS to deploy dense computing systems like Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 rack at scale. The move reflects a broader trend of major cloud providers developing custom hardware to optimize performance and control costs in the competitive AI infrastructure market.</p>

          <p>A judge in Utah has scheduled a September 5 execution date for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate diagnosed with dementia. Menzies, who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker, chose execution by firing squad decades ago. His lawyers are appealing the decision, arguing his cognitive decline is so severe that he cannot rationally understand his punishment, a standard the Supreme Court has previously upheld as necessary for execution. The judge ruled last month that Menzies was competent, but has scheduled a new hearing to evaluate his worsening condition, creating a complex legal and ethical dilemma.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of over $112,000, with its upward momentum appearing to be linked to a strong rally in the equity markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also reached a record close, led by chipmaker Nvidia, which briefly touched a $4 trillion market capitalization. Although institutional adoption has been a key long-term driver for the cryptocurrency, its status as a risk asset means its price often moves in tandem with growth-oriented stocks during periods of positive investor sentiment. Analysts suggest that continued corporate buying and potential crypto-friendly legislation could fuel further gains for the digital asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former chairman of the Conservative Party and a cabinet minister, has announced his defection to the rival Reform UK party. In a statement, Berry declared that "Old Westminster politics has failed" and criticized the Conservative governments he was part of for breaking Britain. He is the fourth former Tory MP to switch to Nigel Farage's party in two weeks, signaling growing momentum for Reform UK and deepening the crisis for the Conservative Party. The move has drawn sharp responses, with Labour linking Reform to the reckless economics of the Liz Truss era, under whom Berry served as chairman.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, for what it terms a "campaign of political and economic warfare." Albanese has been a vocal critic of Israel's military actions in Gaza, which she has described as a genocide, and recently called on companies to cease business with Israel. The sanctions are the latest in a series of U.S. actions targeting critics of Israeli policy, following a pressure campaign to have Albanese removed from her post. The move is seen as part of a broader effort to quell criticism of the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza.</p>
