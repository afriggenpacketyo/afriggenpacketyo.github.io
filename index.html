          <p>At a virtual BRICS summit, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar urged member nations, particularly China and Russia, to address significant trade deficits with New Delhi. He highlighted that India's largest trade imbalances are with its BRICS partners, as the bloc collectively condemned U.S. tariffs. While China and Russia view BRICS as a geopolitical alliance to counter Western influence, India has focused on its economic aspects, such as the New Development Bank. India's trade deficit with China reached a record $99.21 billion, and its deficit with Russia hit $59 billion, prompting calls for more balanced trade flows.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has issued an urgent and complete evacuation order for all residents of Gaza City, warning that it will soon operate with significant force in the area. This directive follows the Israeli government's approval of a plan to seize the city as part of its stated military goal of eliminating Hamas. Despite the severe warnings from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, many residents remain, citing prohibitive costs, lack of space in designated humanitarian zones, and safety concerns about the evacuation routes themselves. The order marks a major escalation in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Serbian police used tear gas, stun grenades, and batons to violently disperse a peaceful protest at the University of Novi Sad, leading to widespread accusations of excessive force. Demonstrators, including students and professors, were beaten and detained, with some describing the police operation as treating them like terrorists. President Aleksandar Vucic defended the police action as a "professionally executed job" to protect state institutions. However, critics and security analysts view it as a move toward open repression and an attempt to intimidate dissent against his regime.</p>

Sources indicate that the 60-year-old Postecoglou is a strong candidate for the position at the City Ground. Initial contact is understood to have been made between the club and Postecoglou's representatives. There is a growing sense that an agreement is possible to bring the experienced manager to the Premier League club as it seeks new leadership.</p>

Candidates face a tight deadline to secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled against breaking up Google, citing the rapid emergence of generative AI as a significant factor that has fundamentally altered the search engine market. Although the court found Google illegally monopolized the search market, Judge Amit Mehta decided against forcing the sale of its Chrome browser. The judge's opinion noted that AI-powered chatbots from competitors like OpenAI and others represent a new reality and a potential game-changer, creating a more competitive landscape than existed when the case began in 2020. Google will instead face lesser penalties, including sharing some data with rivals.</p>

          <p>France's government has collapsed after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou lost a confidence vote, deepening the nation's political turmoil. The ousting was triggered by Bayrou's failure to secure support for his 2026 budget, which included significant spending cuts aimed at reducing the country's large deficit. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint his fifth prime minister in under two years, facing difficult choices that include calling another snap election or attempting to form a new minority government.

Thaksin, an influential figure in Thai politics, had his original eight-year sentence commuted by the king but was released on parole after his hospital stay.

          <p>Scotland secured a crucial victory against Belarus in a professional, if uninspired, performance, strengthening their position in the World Cup qualifying group. The win, combined with Denmark's decisive victory over Greece, has reshaped the group dynamics favorably for the Scots. Key players like Che Adams contributed to the goals, while the return of talents like Ben Gannon-Doak adds creativity and pace to the squad. While challenges remain, particularly an upcoming home match against Greece, there is a growing sense of optimism that Scotland is well-positioned to contend for qualification.</p>

          <p>According to an HSBC co-CEO, multinational corporations are increasingly directing investments toward China's new-economy sectors, including high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. This shift indicates that global companies view China not just as a manufacturing hub but as a key market for driving innovation and consumption. A recent HSBC survey found that China remains the top target for companies looking to expand their global trade capabilities, with many planning to increase their manufacturing presence there. This trend highlights continued international confidence in China's market size, industrial infrastructure, and innovation ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, following the conclusion of tariff negotiations with the United States, sets the stage for a new leader who will have to manage the complex relationship with China. While Beijing has officially called the resignation an internal affair, analysts expect that Tokyo will maintain its stance of viewing China as a strategic competitor. The change in leadership in Japan comes at a time of ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the direction the new prime minister takes will be closely watched for its impact on regional stability and Sino-Japanese ties.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that populist right-wing movements in both the U.S. and the UK are actively trying to rewrite national histories to justify their political goals. It cites the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from museums and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" curriculum as examples of attempts to erase narratives of imperialism, slavery, and minority struggles. The author contends that this historical revisionism is a deliberate strategy to dismantle the democratic and social progress of the 20th century, clearing the way for policies that erode rights for vulnerable communities.</p>
