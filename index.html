          <p>On the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's landfall, new photo essays reflect on the storm's enduring legacy. The hurricane, which struck on August 29, 2005, caused nearly 1,400 deaths and remains the costliest storm in U.S. history, with damages estimated at $200 billion in today's currency. The articles particularly highlight the devastation in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward, a historically Black community that suffered catastrophic flooding due to multiple levee breaches. The images capture both the initial destruction and the long, arduous path of determination and rebuilding that has followed in the two decades since the disaster.</p>

          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former First Lady Kim Keon Hee on charges of bribery and corruption, marking the first time a president's spouse has faced such charges in the country's history. Former Prime Minister Han Duck Soo was also indicted for abetting an insurrection related to ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law declaration. The charges against Kim include stock manipulation, accepting luxury gifts as bribes, and illegally receiving polling data during the 2022 presidential election. These indictments are part of a broader investigation into Yoon's administration, which was authorized after he was impeached and arrested earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings is pursuing an aggressive growth strategy for its international cloud computing business, capitalizing on increasing overseas demand for Chinese artificial intelligence models. A senior executive stated that the company's overseas cloud operations are its fastest-growing segment, driven by clients wanting to host large language models regionally. Tencent plans to leverage its expertise and tools to help international customers implement and utilize open-source AI models developed in China. This move reflects intensified competition among Chinese tech firms like Alibaba and Baidu to expand their AI footprint globally.</p>

The survivors, now averaging 96 years old, are demanding a formal apology and financial compensation from the Japanese government for the atrocities they endured. Despite the historical significance of their cases, provincial high courts have not yet decided whether to accept or dismiss the lawsuits. Lawyers for the plaintiffs emphasize the urgency of the situation, as the women are fighting for recognition and justice before it is too late.</p>

This figure establishes a new state record and makes Florida the leading state for executions in the U.S. in 2025. Windom was sentenced to death for the 1992 killings of his girlfriend, her mother, and another man. The execution proceeded despite pleas for clemency from some family members of the victims, who stated they had forgiven Windom and built relationships with him over the decades. His death extends a series of executions carried out under Governor Ron DeSantis.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Coco Gauff advanced to the third round of the US Open after a challenging and emotional victory over Donna Vekić. Gauff visibly struggled with her serve, committing seven double faults in the first set and breaking down in tears during a changeover. However, she managed to reset mentally, winning a crucial tiebreak and dominating the second set for a 7-6 (5), 6-2 win. Gauff acknowledged the immense pressure of the tournament and the difficulty of remodeling her serve with a new biomechanics coach just before the event. She drew inspiration from seeing gymnast Simone Biles in the crowd.</p>

South Korea's Kospi also fell following reports that the former first lady was indicted on corruption charges, which introduced political uncertainty.

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This action escalates the Trump administration's effort to remove her from the central bank's board. The new referral alleges that Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents and government ethics forms regarding a condominium she owns. This follows an earlier referral concerning two other properties, which had already prompted a DOJ investigation. Cook has responded by suing President Trump to block her dismissal, arguing it is an unlawful attempt to interfere with the Federal Reserve's independence.</p>

Officials stated that while the attacker left behind notes expressing vile and hateful sentiments, a single definitive motive may never be known.

          <p>The White House has appointed Jim O’Neill, a deputy to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting director of the CDC. O'Neill, who lacks a background in medicine or public health, is a former biotech investor and speechwriter who previously worked for conservative tech magnate Peter Thiel. His appointment is expected to align the agency more closely with Kennedy's agenda to overhaul federal vaccine policy. The selection has drawn criticism from public health experts and Democratic senators, who point to O'Neill's past support for unproven COVID-19 treatments and his lack of scientific credentials to lead the nation's top public health agency during a period of turmoil.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still fighting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for funding to complete its rebuilding projects. The city's mayor says FEMA still owes $34 million for critical upgrades to its sewage and stormwater systems, which are necessary to protect against future storms. However, FEMA has denied requests for more money to cover rising costs, creating a stalemate that has left the projects unfinished. Biloxi is one of over 250 municipalities across Louisiana and Mississippi with Katrina relief projects that remain incomplete 20 years after the storm.</p>

While the official cause is still under investigation, sources indicate that authorities are looking into the possibility that improperly discarded ashes from the vineyard may have sparked the blaze. A spokesperson for the winery confirmed they are cooperating with the investigation but declined to comment on the specific reports regarding the ashes.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its long-standing 'customer of size' policy, which has been praised by advocates for plus-size travelers. Previously, the airline guaranteed a refund for a second seat purchased for comfort and space. Under the new policy, effective in January, a refund will only be issued if the flight departs with at least one open seat, creating uncertainty and potential financial burdens for travelers. Advocates argue that the change reverses years of progress in accessibility and will add to the anxiety and humiliation that many plus-size individuals experience while flying. The airline states the change is part of broader updates related to its upcoming switch to assigned seating.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis of video footage has found that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday. The assault, which killed at least 20 people including five journalists, has drawn international condemnation. Initial reports indicated two strikes, but the investigation identified two additional, near-simultaneous impacts on different parts of the hospital in the first wave of the attack. The Israeli military's narrative has evolved since the incident, with an initial inquiry suggesting troops identified a Hamas camera in the area.

This knowledge could be crucial for conservation efforts, helping to select the best oak trees for future planting to restore Britain's woodlands.

Holocaust memorial organizations have condemned the practice, stating it disrespects victims, distresses survivors, and dangerously distorts history.
