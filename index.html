          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building, New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, is facing renewed criticism for his past advocacy to defund the police. While Mamdani expressed his condolences for the victims, social media users quickly resurfaced his previous statements from 2020 calling to "defund" and "dismantle" the NYPD. During his recent primary campaign, however, he had shifted his stance, stating he would not defund the police and that they play a critical role in public safety. This political fallout occurs in the context of a four-way mayoral race.</p>

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the revered Chicago Cubs second baseman and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, has passed away at the age of 65 after a battle with prostate cancer. Remembered for his integrity and competitive spirit, Sandberg's career spanned 16 seasons, most of which were with the Cubs, earning him an MVP award in 1984, ten All-Star selections, and nine Gold Gloves. A pivotal moment in his career was the "Ryne Sandberg Game" in 1984, where his two late-inning home runs led the Cubs to a dramatic victory. After his playing career, he remained involved in baseball as a manager and a beloved Cubs ambassador.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Park Avenue office building in Manhattan, resulting in the deaths of four people, including an NYPD officer, before the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suspect, identified as Shane Devon Tamura of Las Vegas, used a long rifle to carry out the attack in the building that houses the NFL's corporate offices and several financial firms. Law enforcement responded quickly, containing the scene and confirming the lone shooter was neutralized. The incident marks the 254th mass shooting in the United States this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te will not make a stopover in the United States on his way to South America, a decision that could ease tensions with Beijing and potentially create an opening for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump. While the Financial Times reported that Washington had denied a request for a stop in New York, Taiwan's official statement attributed the cancellation to domestic issues, including typhoon recovery efforts. The move avoids a diplomatic friction point with China, which views such US stopovers as a challenge to its sovereignty, and comes after Lai's party faced recent political setbacks.</p>

          <p>Following international condemnation over images of starvation, Israel has reversed its policy and is allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where roughly two million people are displaced. Convoys of trucks and international airdrops are delivering food, but the United Nations warns this is only a fraction of what is needed to avert a deeper crisis, with at least 500 trucks required daily compared to the 120 currently arriving. The UN's agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, reports that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished.

A memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can discuss their faith and display religious items, as long as they honor requests to stop and the expression does not constitute harassment. This policy, which builds on previous guidance from the Clinton era, is part of a broader push by the administration to protect religious freedom.

This exacerbates a pre-existing national shortage of child mental health professionals, particularly in rural areas, with 47 states failing to meet recommended counselor-to-student ratios.

          <p>A psychological phenomenon of regret is prevalent even among successful cryptocurrency investors who feel they missed out on larger fortunes by selling too early. Stories from investors highlight the difficulty of "HODLing" (holding on for dear life) through extreme volatility, with many recounting decisions to sell assets like Bitcoin or Dogecoin for modest gains, only to see their value skyrocket later. One investor sold XRP holdings that hit $6 million, missing a potential $8 million value, while another declined a payment of 30 Bitcoin in 2011.

One shopper, Matthew Kolakowski, chased the attacker out of the store and used a shopping cart to knock him down after witnessing him stab an elderly woman.

Would-be campers can now enter a free drawing for a chance to secure a spot, with unsuccessful applicants receiving points to increase their odds in future lotteries.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that the stock market failed to rally after President Trump's trade deal announcements because investors are experiencing "tariff ennui" and are more focused on other major events this week. He suggests the pattern of threatening high tariffs before settling for a deal with a "sweetener" has become predictable and is already priced into the market. According to Cramer, Wall Street's attention is currently preoccupied with the upcoming earnings reports from Big Tech giants, the Federal Reserve's meeting, and the forthcoming employment data, which are seen as more significant market movers.

          <p>A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel appears likely to uphold a lower court's injunction blocking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" and indiscriminate street arrests in Southern California. Judges fiercely questioned the Justice Department's lawyer about the constitutionality of the tactics, which a district judge found to violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The lower court order bars agents from using race, location, or language as a pretext for enforcement without reasonable suspicion.

          <p>A court in Bogotá has convicted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe of witness tampering, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal court. Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, was found to have bribed witnesses to prevent them from testifying about his alleged links to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case originated from a 2012 accusation Uribe made against a left-wing senator, which backfired and led to an investigation into Uribe himself. The conviction, which could carry a sentence of up to 12 years, is a significant moment for Colombia.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that President Donald Trump's primary source of information is television, which significantly shapes his policy decisions and makes him susceptible to manipulation. Using Trump's recent comments on starvation in Gaza—which he acknowledged based on television images rather than intelligence briefings—the article argues he processes events as a media critic rather than a policymaker. This reliance on a narrow, often partisan, information stream, combined with a distrust of experts, leaves him vulnerable to persuasion through media appearances.
