          <p>Following a claim by Donald Trump that he persuaded Coca-Cola to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in the U.S., shares of producer Archer-Daniels-Midland fell significantly. Coca-Cola responded with a non-committal statement, thanking Trump for his enthusiasm but not confirming a change, while the Corn Refiners Association warned of potential job losses. The announcement highlights ongoing debates about food ingredients and their economic impact, with PepsiCo's CEO noting that most of their U.S. beverages already avoid corn syrup. This development has created uncertainty for ingredient and agricultural industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival in Austria is set to reflect global crises through a program centered on themes of power struggles, conflict, and hope. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated a lineup featuring operas like Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto" and Verdi's "Macbeth," which examine the downfall of powerful rulers. The festival aims to use the performing arts as a lens to understand historical and contemporary conflicts, offering audiences a space for transformation and reflection. Despite some controversy, the event will also feature numerous Russian artists and a reading by a Ukrainian author, highlighting its complex engagement with current events.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has confirmed its intention to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections before the next general election, a move that would enfranchise approximately 1.5 million young people. This change, a key pledge from the ruling Labour Party, aligns the entire UK with Scotland and Wales, where 16-year-olds can already vote in local and devolved elections. The reform package also includes expanding acceptable forms of voter ID to include bank cards and moving towards an automated voter registration system. The proposals have been welcomed by youth advocacy groups but criticized by opposition parties.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking trial in the United Kingdom has resulted in the birth of eight healthy babies using a novel IVF technique designed to prevent the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases. The method combines DNA from the mother and father with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a female donor, effectively creating a child with genetic material from three individuals. This breakthrough offers hope to women with mitochondrial mutations, which can cause severe and untreatable conditions. While hailed as a major success, the technique remains controversial due to ethical concerns about embryo destruction and fears of "designer babies."</p>

In contrast, the French team is noted for its diversity, which players attribute to a widespread, accessible club system.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lending experts suggest that homeowners should not expect a drop in home equity loan rates following the Federal Reserve's July meeting, as persistent inflation makes a rate cut unlikely. With inflation still above the Fed's 2% target and a strong jobs report, the central bank is widely expected to maintain the current federal funds rate. Since home equity loan rates are closely tied to the Fed's decisions, they are forecasted to hold steady, currently averaging just above 8% for five-year terms. Borrowers hoping for lower rates may need to wait until at least the fall for any potential decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Criminal theft of cryptocurrencies has surged in the first half of 2025, with $2.17 billion already stolen from crypto services, surpassing the total for all of 2024. A report from Chainalysis attributes much of this to a massive hack of the Bybit exchange, but also highlights a disturbing trend of physical violence against crypto holders. Criminals are increasingly using kidnapping and coercion to gain access to individuals' digital wallets, which now account for over 23% of total thefts. The rise in crime is linked to increased crypto adoption and price appreciation, making platforms and individuals more valuable targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system is raising concerns that borrowers will face significantly higher monthly payments. The Biden-era SAVE plan, known for its generous terms, is now defunct, and new legislation will limit future borrowers to just two repayment options, including a new "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP). Consumer advocates and experts warn that payments under RAP will be substantially higher than under SAVE, potentially more than doubling for many individuals. This shift may leave many borrowers with no affordable repayment options, increasing their risk of default and financial distress. (not investment advice)</p>

She projected that key inflation measures will show no progress in recent months, remaining stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target.

The administration has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and issued memos suggesting that rigorous corporate law enforcement burdens business. While the DOJ states it will still pursue certain financial crimes like healthcare fraud, federal prosecutions for white-collar offenses have declined over 10% from last year. Critics argue this approach turns a blind eye to corporate wrongdoing, while the administration's focus remains on crimes related to immigration.</p>
