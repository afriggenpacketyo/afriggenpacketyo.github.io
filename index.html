          <p>WNBA star Brittney Griner made her first return to Phoenix since joining the Atlanta Dream, leading her new team to a 90-79 victory over her former club, the Mercury. Before the game, the Mercury paid tribute to Griner with a video, celebrating her 11 seasons and 2014 championship with the team. Griner, who was a nine-time All-Star with Phoenix, expressed that seeing former teammates like Diana Taurasi courtside felt good and ignited her performance. She finished the game with a strong 17 points and nine rebounds for Atlanta.</p>

          <p>The power of the American passport has continued to decline, falling to a 10th-place tie with Iceland and Lithuania in the 2025 Henley Passport Index. This marks a significant drop from its top-ranked position in 2014, with the U.S. now offering visa-free access to 182 destinations compared to top-ranked Singapore's 193. The report suggests that the U.S. and U.K. are retreating behind more restrictive entry policies, which impacts their diplomatic influence and travel freedom. Despite the drop, the State Department remains confident in the passport's strength and global reach.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 13:49:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England established a commanding position on the second day of the fourth Test against India, driven by a powerful performance from both its bowlers and opening batsmen. Captain Ben Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helping to dismiss India for 358. In response, England's openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett launched an aggressive assault, scoring 166 for the first wicket at a rapid pace. Despite their eventual dismissals for 84 and 94 respectively, England ended the day strongly at 225-2, trailing by only 133 runs.</p>

          <p>On the eve of a five-day strike by resident doctors in England, Health Secretary Wes Streeting sent a letter expressing deep regret over the situation, accusing the British Medical Association (BMA) of not engaging in negotiations in good faith. The strike, part of a long-running pay dispute, is expected to cause significant disruption, with over a million appointments already canceled from previous actions. NHS England is attempting to maintain non-urgent care, a move the BMA considers unsafe, while also criticizing the high rates senior doctors are demanding for covering shifts.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines experienced a significant stock drop after its second-quarter earnings and revenue missed Wall Street expectations and it slashed its 2025 profit forecast. The carrier now projects 2025 pre-tax earnings between $600 million and $800 million, a steep reduction from its earlier $1.7 billion estimate. CEO Bob Jordan cited macro uncertainty and a need for summer discounting as contributing factors, though he noted signs of a positive inflection recently.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sent a revised anti-corruption bill to parliament after an earlier version sparked widespread protests and condemnation from the European Union. The initial bill was criticized for giving the government more power over anti-corruption bodies, seen as a major step backward for the country's rule of law. The controversy led to the first large-scale unrest in Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion. Zelenskyy stated the new bill guarantees the independence of these crucial institutions, a key requirement for Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU and maintain Western support.</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, a high-ranking Justice Department official, is scheduled to meet with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell to discuss what she knows about the Jeffrey Epstein network. The meeting comes amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to be more transparent about the Epstein investigation, particularly after a DOJ memo concluded there was no "client list." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence in Florida for her role in helping Epstein abuse underage girls. The move is seen as an effort to quell criticism and pursue new leads in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced the formation of a Justice Department "strike force" to investigate claims that the Obama administration engaged in a "treasonous conspiracy" related to the 2016 election. The investigation follows the release of declassified documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who alleges that officials manufactured intelligence to suggest Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. The move has been embraced by President Trump, but Obama's office has called the allegations "outrageous," and legal experts note presidential immunity may block any potential prosecution of the former president.</p>

          <p>A major network outage at BT Group, which owns mobile operator EE, left thousands of customers across the UK unable to make or receive calls on Thursday. The issue affected both mobile and landline services, and for a period, even impacted some customers' ability to reach the 999 emergency number, though that access was later restored. Outage tracker Downdetector showed a significant spike in reported problems. A spokesperson for BT apologized for the disruption, stating the company was working urgently to fix the issue that impacted its more than 30 million UK customers.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of 'South Park' opened with an episode that sharply satirized both President Donald Trump and its parent company, Paramount. The premiere came just a day after the show's creators signed a new $1.5 billion deal with the media giant. The episode, "Sermon on the Mount," directly referenced recent controversies, including Trump's lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, and the power the president wields over media companies. The defiant episode was seen by media observers as a bold move, criticizing its new business partners in its signature provocative style.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's internal watchdog has reportedly obtained evidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details from a classified email in an encrypted Signal chat group. According to senior officials, the messages contained information about a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen, derived from an email marked "SECRET//NOFORN," which restricts its dissemination. Administration officials, including Hegseth, have previously denied that any classified information was shared in the chat, which was inadvertently made public when a reporter was added.

Forecasters predict temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average, with feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the oppressive conditions have been exacerbated by "corn sweat," a phenomenon where corn crops release large amounts of water vapor into the air through transpiration.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick dismissed criticism from a U.S. auto industry group regarding a new trade deal with Japan, claiming the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Stellantis are "cool with it."

An industry council had called it a "bad deal," but Lutnick argued that U.S. companies can avoid the tariffs entirely by moving their manufacturing facilities back to the United States.

          <p>Poland plans to extend the temporary police checks at its borders with Germany and Lithuania, which were initially reintroduced for 30 days in early July. The controls, a response to a similar move by Germany, are part of a broader trend among several EU nations reinstating checks within the normally border-free Schengen Area due to concerns over irregular migration. Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak confirmed the extension, citing migration being weaponized by Russia and Belarus. Since the checks began, Polish border guards have reportedly refused entry to over 100 people attempting to cross from Germany and Lithuania.</p>

          <p>AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, known as "the godfather of AI," are cautioning that a simple "kill switch" will not be a viable solution if artificial intelligence becomes uncontrollable. As AI systems become more integrated and intelligent, they will be too decentralized to simply unplug, and they could become masters of persuasion, convincing humans not to shut them down. The article explores the paradox that any extreme measure to stop AI, such as an EMP or destroying data centers, would likely cause a devastating humanitarian crisis by crippling civilization's essential infrastructure. The focus, experts argue, must be on instilling benevolent values in AI from the start.</p>
