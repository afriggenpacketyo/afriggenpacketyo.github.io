        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks and mandates they display clear identification, such as badges with their name and agency. This preemptive measure also directs city departments to assist residents in understanding their rights and bars municipal police from collaborating with federal enforcement actions that could violate civil liberties. The move has drawn criticism from the White House, which characterized it as a political stunt distracting from crime.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation suggests that famed Sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him, but modern forensic analysis reveals inconsistencies with his account. Evidence indicates the crime scene was staged, Pauline was shot outside the car before being placed inside, and a wound on the sheriff was likely self-inflicted. The district attorney stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough evidence for a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire through the windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing two children, ages 8 and 10, and injuring 18 other people. The 23-year-old shooter, identified as a former student of the attached school, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the church. Armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol, the shooter had reportedly conducted surveillance of the church weeks prior. Investigators are examining a video manifesto and other evidence, treating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs," declaring most of them illegal. The court found that the President improperly used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, stating that the power to impose such taxes rests exclusively with Congress. The decision affects levies on goods from over 60 countries, as well as specific tariffs previously placed on China, Canada, and Mexico. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed under a different law, remain unaffected by the ruling, which the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing consolidated advice on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that limits should adapt to developmental stages. For toddlers, the consensus is "screen-free until age three," as this period is crucial for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes is recommended to encourage imagination and social interaction. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to content and context, with experts urging parents to engage with their children about their digital activities to mitigate risks like online grooming and ensure technology is used constructively.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could seriously threaten the central bank's political independence. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy and lead to severe long-term economic damage. She points to historical examples in other countries where such actions resulted in weaker stock markets, higher inflation, and currency depreciation. Patterson predicts that while markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, the sustained inflation would ultimately harm the economy.

The issue has sparked protests and counter-demonstrations across England and Scotland.

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, leading to 90 hospitalizations and seven deaths. An investigation traced the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to enhance the city's detection and prevention measures, including more frequent testing of cooling towers.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to resume admitting vulnerable Afghans who were previously promised entry, many of whom are currently in Pakistan facing the threat of deportation. These individuals, who often worked for Western organizations, fled the Taliban but have been stuck in limbo. A one-month pause on deportations by Pakistan is expiring, and authorities plan to resume them in September, putting over a million people at risk. Families live in constant fear of police raids, unable to work or send their children to school, as they wait for German visas that were delayed by new security check requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed an AI-enhanced stethoscope that can detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis. The device records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to an AI trained on thousands of patients. A large-scale study in London GP surgeries found that patients examined with the device were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with these conditions within a year. The British Heart Foundation has called the innovation a potential "game-changer" for treating patients sooner, with plans for a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>Andriy Parubiy, the former speaker of Ukraine's parliament and a prominent figure in the 2014 Euromaidan revolution, has been shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Unverified footage shows a gunman, disguised as a courier, approaching the 54-year-old politician on the street and shooting him before fleeing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the killing as a "terrible murder," and authorities have launched a massive manhunt for the suspect. Parubiy was a key organizer of the pro-European protests that ousted a pro-Russian president and later joined Ukraine's territorial defense after the 2022 full-scale invasion.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has directed all staff to return to in-office work by September 15, about five weeks after a deadly shooting occurred at its Atlanta headquarters. The incident, in which a gunman killed a police officer before taking his own life, did not injure any CDC staff but left the workforce shaken. The return-to-office mandate comes during a period of significant turmoil for the agency, which has faced staff cuts, leadership changes, and political controversy under the current administration. The CDC has assured employees that safety is its top priority and alternative workspaces will be provided for those whose offices were damaged.</p>

          <p>As American unions prepare for Labor Day, the mood is somber due to increasing challenges from the Trump administration's policies, including immigration raids and proposed cuts to the National Labor Relations Board. Labor groups have been stretched thin supporting members affected by deportations and are bracing for further rollbacks of worker protections established under the previous administration. In California, unions representing healthcare and in-home care workers are particularly concerned about federal cuts to Medicaid. Experts warn that the combination of anti-union federal policies and budget pressures could pose an existential threat to the labor movement.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire in northern Napa County has burned through 6,800 acres, causing an estimated $65 million in agricultural losses, primarily affecting wine grape growers. Wineries like Robert Craig on Howell Mountain lost their entire crop from one vineyard, valued at $4.5 million, after firefighters used the property for a controlled burn to protect a nearby town. While vineyards can act as fire breaks, the heat and smoke from nearby blazes can still ruin a harvest, a recurring problem for the industry. The incident highlights the growing threat wildfires pose to California's treasured wine country, compounding financial pressures from soaring insurance costs.</p>

          <p>After a comprehensive, two-year study identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to Iowa's severe water quality problems, public officials have quietly eliminated the funding intended to promote the report's findings. The study, which connects pollutants from the state's powerful farm industry to health risks like high cancer rates, has been controversial. Over $400,000 remaining in the project's budget, partly earmarked for public awareness and outreach, was reportedly "zeroed out" without explanation. Critics fear this move is an attempt to downplay the report and impede necessary reforms to protect public health and the environment.</p>
