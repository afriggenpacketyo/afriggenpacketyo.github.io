          <p>Following the fatal shooting of Minnesota state assemblywoman Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and the wounding of state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, members of Congress are calling for increased security measures. House Republicans held a conference call with the House sergeant at arms and U.S. Capitol Police to voice their concerns about safety in their home districts and request more protection, while House Democrats are expected to have a similar call. Authorities say Vance Boelter faces multiple federal charges for the attacks, allegedly targeting legislators he believed to be Democrats, and Michigan Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten postponed a town hall after learning she was on a list connected to the shooting. The number of threats against members of Congress has been rising, prompting increased scrutiny of security protocols. </p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) has postponed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to a problem with the rocket booster. The launch was scrubbed with roughly 30 minutes left in the countdown due to an elevated purge temperature within the Atlas V rocket's booster engine, according to ULA CEO Tory Bruno. The launch from Florida's Space Coast was originally scheduled for last Friday but was rescheduled to Monday due to inclement weather. A new launch date will be provided later as engineers work to resolve the issue with the GN2 purge line. </p>

The incidents occurred between October 2023 and June 2024 at two nurseries, one of which has since closed. Lecka told police she smoked cannabis before her shifts, and will be sentenced at Kingston Crown Court on September 26. </p>

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey examines the failures in addressing group-based sexual exploitation, highlighting that children being abused are too often blamed instead of helped. The report criticizes the lack of action by authorities over the years as "denial" or a collective "blindness," particularly regarding the ethnicity of perpetrators. The government has accepted the report's call for better data collection on the ethnicity of suspects and has promised research into the factors driving exploitation. The national inquiry will be closely watched to see if its recommendations are put into practice, as past reports have often been shelved without meaningful change. </p>

The unveiling of AMD's next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including the Helios full-server rack, has also fueled enthusiasm.

          <p>A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 65 can provide a substantial monthly income, generally ranging from approximately $2,246 to $2,590, but this amount varies based on several factors. These factors include gender, life expectancy, the current interest rate environment, the annuity type and structure, and any optional features selected. Women typically receive lower monthly payments than men due to longer life expectancies, and different annuity structures (like single life vs. joint life) affect payouts. While annuities offer financial security through guaranteed income, they also involve trade-offs such as reduced liquidity and potential for lower returns compared to other investments.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to conduct mass deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those run by Democrats. Speaking at the G7 summit in Alberta, Trump stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities like New York and Chicago, in addition to Los Angeles, due to their status as "sanctuary cities." This announcement follows Trump's social media post indicating he was ordering ICE to oversee the largest mass deportation program in history.

She highlighted that restaurants and other businesses are facing worse conditions than during the pandemic, with reduced customer traffic and a decline in to-go orders.

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that authorities have "shied away from" addressing the ethnicity of individuals involved in grooming gangs. The report highlights that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang perpetrators, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions at a national level. The report also suggests that ignorance and fear of being perceived as racist have led organizations to turn a blind eye to abuse. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has apologized to victims and announced a new national inquiry into grooming gangs, which will include mandatory data collection on ethnicity and nationality for all suspects. </p>

Credit card rates, closely tied to the Fed's benchmark, have remained elevated, prompting advice for consumers to explore balance transfers or personal loans to secure lower rates. Mortgage rates, influenced by Treasury yields, have shown little movement, sustaining challenges to housing affordability. Auto loan rates, while fixed, are affected by rising car prices, and experts recommend comparison shopping for financing. Federal student loan rates, set annually, remain stable, though borrowers face fewer loan forgiveness options. (not investment advice)</p>
