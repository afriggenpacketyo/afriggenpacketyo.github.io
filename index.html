            <p>Cody Balmer, a 38-year-old Pennsylvania man, has been charged with attempted murder and other offenses after allegedly setting a fire at Governor Josh Shapiro's residence. The fire forced Shapiro and his family to evacuate early Sunday morning, causing significant damage. Balmer reportedly climbed a fence and used homemade incendiary devices. While Shapiro, who is Jewish, declined to call it a hate crime, he emphasized that such violence is unacceptable. Balmer's mother stated her son suffers from mental illness and had stopped taking his medication, and is being held without bail.</p>

            <p>A team of Chinese scientists has uncovered a key mechanism behind how breast cancer cells use the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and multiply. Their findings reveal that the metabolic interplay between cancer cells and macrophages plays a dominant role in arginine-driven breast cancer progression. This discovery could lead to new precision therapy approaches for breast cancer by starving tumors of this essential building block for protein. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that help to clear out dead cells and stimulate other cells involved in immune function.</p>

            <p>Newspaper headlines are split between the lighter news of Katy Perry's brief space flight and the more serious issue of ongoing bin strikes in Birmingham. While some papers focus on Perry's celebrity space trip, others highlight the political and economic turmoil in Britain, including the bin strike and concerns about Chinese investment in British infrastructure. The contrast in headlines reflects the diverse range of issues capturing public attention.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing $2.2 billion in federal funds to Harvard University after the school refused to comply with demands to crack down on antisemitism and alter diversity programs. Harvard's president stated the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. The administration's demands included leadership reforms, an end to diversity policies, and an audit of "viewpoint diversity" among students and faculty. The move has sparked controversy, with some supporting Harvard's stance on academic freedom.</p>

            <p>Senior advisers within President Trump's inner circle privately warned that some tariff proposals could have devastating effects on global financial markets and the U.S. economy. Internal disagreements over the policy manifested well before the public announcement. Some advisers predicted serious economic instability, while others advocated for a more calculated rollout with targeted tariffs. Ultimately, the administration paused some of the tariffs for 90 days after financial markets reacted negatively.</p>
