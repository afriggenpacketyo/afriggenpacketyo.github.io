            <p>The Australian government has controversially resorted to shooting koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park due to starvation and suffering caused by bushfires and habitat loss. While officials claim this is to end the koalas' suffering, animal welfare advocates are alarmed by the indiscriminate nature of the cull. The underlying issue is the destruction of koala habitats due to logging and development, exacerbated by climate change-induced bushfires. Experts emphasize the need for extensive, connected forests and better management of eucalyptus plantations to support koala populations.</p>

            <p>The Pentagon is experiencing internal turmoil as a leak investigation leads to the suspension of three top aides to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Accusations of unauthorized disclosures, potentially involving classified information, are being investigated, with tensions reportedly exacerbated by personal conflicts within Hegseth's inner circle. While officials deny that foreign policy views are the reason for the suspensions, the situation highlights the intense pressures and potential for internal strife within high-level government positions. The aides are civilian political appointees, meaning they could be fired at-will regardless of the investigation.</p>

            <p>Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that the “concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man.” By unanimous decision, the five justices hearing the case decreed that the terms man, woman, and sex used there “refer to biological sex.” They also stressed that their ruling applied only to interpreting anti-discrimination law, and was not a wider judgment on the validity of transgender identities. The ruling shows that society can separate out the distinct forms of discrimination faced by biological females and trans women, without denying that either group has a valid claim to protection under the law.</p>

            <p>As Iran and the United States prepare for a second round of nuclear talks in Rome, hopes for de-escalation are tempered by military threats and mixed messages. While both sides described the first round of talks as constructive, Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who is leading the US negotiating team, posted on X on Tuesday: "Any final arrangement must set a framework for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East - meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization programme.". The website of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Iran had agreed to talks only because the US limited its demands strictly to nuclear issues - not out of fear of US and Israeli strikes.</p>

The state Board of State and Community Corrections ordered Los Padrinos shut down in December 2024, finding the department did not have enough staff to safely operate.</p>
