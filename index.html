          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public feud with President Donald Trump after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill. The conflict sent Tesla shares plummeting, erasing billions in market value and damaging a once-close relationship. Ire from the Trump administration could impact Tesla through future regulation, investigations, and government support, especially regarding tariff exemptions. Tesla was already facing declining revenue and increased competition, and the company is now facing boycotts due to Musk's political activities, and the company's board is facing scrutiny for failing to rein in Musk's behavior.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing sex trafficking trial against Sean "Diddy" Combs, his former girlfriend, identified as "Jane," testified about feeling pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while Combs watched, despite her discomfort. She claimed that a network of employees facilitated these encounters, referred to as "hotel nights" or "freak-offs," and procured drugs for them. Prosecutors aim to demonstrate that Combs ran a criminal enterprise, while the defense argues the encounters were consensual. Jane also testified about a financial agreement, a "love contract," where Combs provided her with a $10,000 monthly allowance, which she alleges he threatened to withhold if she resisted the "hotel nights".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is struggling to decrease the amount of foreign aid allocated to cover hotel expenses for asylum seekers in the UK, with projections indicating a marginal reduction in spending compared to the previous year. This diversion of funds from overseas development assistance (ODA) has led to significant cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development initiatives worldwide. Critics argue that the Home Office lacks incentive to reduce ODA spending, as the funds are not drawn from its own budget. While the Home Office aims to expedite asylum decisions and introduce stricter financial eligibility checks, concerns persist regarding the impact on international aid commitments.

          <p>Former Steeler Ryan Clark has voiced his disapproval of the Pittsburgh Steelers' decision to sign Aaron Rodgers, asserting that it will only perpetuate the team's mediocrity. Clark acknowledges that Rodgers improves the quarterback position but doubts it will lead to championship contention. The Steelers signed the 41-year-old Rodgers to a one-year deal after his tenure with the New York Jets ended in disappointment. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, will work with a new offense and hopes to lead the Steelers to a playoff position.</p>

Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's secret services used only domestically produced weapons for the attack, avoiding the deployment of equipment from allied nations.

Abrego Garcia now faces federal charges for human trafficking, and the administration will attempt to prove his alleged ties to MS-13. By bringing him back, the administration can address concerns about due-process rights and present evidence to support their claims. The decision marks a reversal from previous statements and actions by Trump administration officials.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's public feud with President Donald Trump has sparked concerns about the potential impact on his businesses, particularly Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict, stemming from policy disagreements and personal attacks, has already led to a drop in Tesla's share price. Some analysts argue that the problems for Musk's businesses run deeper than this spat, including challenges in the autonomous vehicle market and a grassroots social media campaign against Tesla. Musk's actions have raised questions about his focus and motivation, and it remains to be seen whether the falling out with Trump will help or harm his companies in the long run.</p>

The parasite spreads through direct contact with animals or surfaces contaminated with animal feces, posing a particular risk to young children, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems.

Some credit poor farmers using cheese as a meat substitute, while others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves said rarebit was associated with Welshness, with cheese being a vital part of European diets, and the name Welsh rarebit appeared much later. Despite the uncertainty, the dish remains a nostalgic comfort food enjoyed worldwide.</p>
