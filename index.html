          <p>Actor Freddie Prinze Jr. shared his perspective on his 23-year marriage to Sarah Michelle Gellar, attributing their success to being friends first and putting in continuous effort. He emphasized that marriage is hard work regardless of one's profession and that mutual respect is crucial, even during disagreements. Gellar echoed these sentiments, suggesting modern society's disposable attitude often extends to relationships, and humorously added that separate bathrooms might also be a key to their enduring union. The couple, who met in 1997, prioritize their family life with their two children.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, despite her claim it was a tragic accident. Her defense, dubbed the "Bugs Bunny defense," argued she believed the gun was unloaded after a playful exchange mimicking the cartoon character Elmer Fudd saying "no more buwwets." Prosecutors successfully argued she intentionally shot her sleeping husband twice in the head. After an initial mistrial where the jury deadlocked, a second jury found her guilty, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity contract killing in Cardiff, his sister is publicly appealing to the fugitive suspect, Mohammed Ali Ege. Aamir was stabbed to death at his home by two hitmen who went to the wrong address, intending to kill a businessman over a property dispute. Nishat Siddiqi urged Ege, who escaped custody in India in 2011 and is one of Europe's most wanted men, to surrender. She stated he is not truly free while living a life on the run and that his family is also suffering.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Wipha has forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people in southern China as it prepared to make landfall in Guangdong province. The China Meteorological Administration issued an orange alert, its second-highest warning level, for the powerful storm. With wind speeds exceeding 150 km/h (93 mph), the typhoon has already brought heavy rain and strong winds to the region, including Hong Kong, after battering Taiwan and the Philippines. Authorities evacuated over 278,000 people as a precaution against severe downpours and potential flooding.</p>

          <p>In a complex Wisconsin murder case, 21st-century technology played a pivotal role in both exonerating an initial suspect and convicting the killer. When Nicole Vander Heyden was murdered in 2016, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was first arrested but later cleared by data from his Fitbit, which corroborated his alibi. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Steven Burch. Data from his phone's Google Dashboard tracked his movements to the crime scene, where the body was found, and back to his home, securing his conviction for the murder.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece by Simon Tisdall suggests that the pursuit of peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine is failing not just for political reasons, but due to a global crisis of morality. The article argues that a shared, universal moral order has fractured, leading to moral relativism where atrocities are justified by different groups, making impartial mediation nearly impossible. This breakdown is mirrored in the collapse of the international rules-based order, allowing conflicts to persist with routine targeting of civilians. The author contends that ending these wars requires a collective reaffirmation of universal ethical standards.</p>
