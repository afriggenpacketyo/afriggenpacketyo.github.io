          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 03:43:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia is set to resume selling its H20 AI chips to China after a U.S. export ban was eased, a move initially seen as a major win. However, analysts predict the company's market share in China will significantly decline, potentially from 66% to 54% by 2025. This erosion is driven by the rise of competitive domestic chipmakers like Huawei, which gained prominence during the U.S. restrictions. Beijing is also signaling intentions to favor homegrown technology, creating further regulatory and competitive hurdles for Nvidia's long-term dominance in the crucial Chinese market.

The workers, who build military aircraft, rejected a four-year contract offer from the company despite it including a proposed 40% average wage growth. The union stated the walkout is a stand for "respect and dignity," signaling that the company's offer did not adequately address their core concerns. Boeing has activated a contingency plan to continue operations with non-striking employees to support its customers.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, columnist Timothy Garton Ash argues that the Democratic party made a catastrophic error by not encouraging President Biden to step aside before the election. He contends it was obvious to most Americans that Biden was too old for a second term, a fact the political establishment and liberal media were slow to acknowledge. The article suggests a combination of fear of losing access, party tribalism, and deference to the presidency led to a collective failure to act. The author concludes that the party must learn from this mistake and empower a new generation of leaders.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season tour under new manager Ruben Amorim shows promising signs, but it remains uncertain if this marks a genuine recovery or another false dawn. Amorim has introduced a new culture emphasizing player responsibility and a more relaxed environment, alongside tactical shifts like a three-man defense. While the team has looked better and sports science data is positive, weaknesses in midfield persist. The article concludes that the true test of this new approach will only be revealed when the competitive Premier League season begins against Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a controversial new congressional map. The proposed map, championed by Governor Greg Abbott, is designed to significantly increase the GOP's majority in the U.S. House. Democrats argue Republicans are using a special session, initially meant for disaster relief, to push through a "Trump gerrymander." Governor Abbott has threatened to remove the absent lawmakers from their positions, setting up a high-stakes political showdown over voting rights and representation in the state.</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 157 migrants, mostly Ethiopian nationals, sank off the coast of Yemen's Abyan province due to bad weather, resulting in at least 68 deaths. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), only twelve people have been rescued, with dozens still missing. The incident highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, where smugglers often use unseaworthy vessels. The IOM has called for enhanced legal pathways for migration to prevent such tragedies, which have claimed thousands of lives in recent years.</p>

          <p>BYD, China's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, reported its first monthly delivery decline of the year, signaling the impact of a fierce price war reshaping the market. While BYD's shipments fell, competitors like Xpeng hit record numbers, and others like Xiaomi and Leapmotor saw growth, illustrating a shifting competitive landscape. The intense discounting, initiated by BYD itself, has drawn concern from Chinese policymakers who have warned against excessive competition.

Due to Ong's poor health from a rare bone marrow cancer, prosecutors have recommended a fine instead of a jail sentence, citing the need for "judicial mercy."

The article suggests this hiring indicates Guardiola is preparing for a tactical evolution towards a more direct, high-octane style of play, mirroring the "modern football" he sees in teams like Liverpool and Newcastle. This is supported by recent player signings who excel at dribbling and fast transitions. This strategic pivot could see City move away from its traditional possession-based "positional play" to embrace a more dynamic approach.</p>

          <p>A new report from the UK-China Transparency think tank suggests that some Chinese students in the UK are being pressured by their government to spy on peers and report on discussions of sensitive topics. The survey of academics also revealed instances of Chinese officials warning lecturers to avoid subjects like Xinjiang or the origins of Covid. This raises serious concerns about academic freedom and free speech on UK campuses, which a new law aims to protect. The Chinese embassy has dismissed the report as "groundless," but the allegations highlight growing fears of foreign interference in higher education.</p>

          <p>A third child, 10-year-old Ari Buchman, has died from injuries sustained after a summer camp sailboat collided with a barge in Biscayne Bay. The crash, which occurred last Monday, had already claimed the lives of a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl. The children were part of a sailing camp operated by the Miami Yacht Club when their vessel was struck and dragged under the barge.

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to become profitable in 2025, a significant milestone for the country's maturing biotech sector. According to analysts, this marks a turning point where innovative domestic firms no longer need to rely solely on investor funding for survival. Innovent, in particular, is expected to see a major revenue boost from its newly launched weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which could contribute a sixth of its total sales this year. This success demonstrates the growing value and competitiveness of Chinese pharmaceutical companies. (not investment advice)</p>
