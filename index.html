          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett outlines three categories of investments, distinguishing between currency-denominated assets, non-productive assets like gold, and productive assets such as farms or businesses. He argues that gold's value relies solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future, as it produces nothing on its own. Buffett emphasizes his preference for investing in businesses and assets that generate tangible returns over time, making their intrinsic value the basis for investment rather than market speculation.

          <p>Cities across the globe, including New York and London, are undergoing a transformation by redesigning streets to prioritize cyclists over cars. This movement involves creating protected bike lanes, safer intersections, and tweaking traffic signals to make cycling a safer and more appealing mode of transport for all ages. The shift towards two wheels offers numerous benefits, including reduced carbon emissions, less noise pollution, significant cost savings for residents, and improved public health. While challenges like e-bike safety and driver resistance exist, the overall trend points toward more livable and sustainable urban centers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece contends that the Supreme Court should affirm President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. The author argues that the Fourteenth Amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction" clause was not intended to apply to the children of illegal immigrants, drawing parallels to historical rulings concerning Native Americans. The article asserts that the current interpretation incentivizes dangerous border crossings and that changing the policy is a matter of national sovereignty. It frames the issue as a necessary step to address the ongoing immigration crisis and restore the original meaning of the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Marissa Coreno, diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer at age 27, is sharing her experience to highlight the increasing incidence of the disease in younger women. Initially dismissing a lump in her armpit, she was urged by colleagues to get it checked, leading to the life-altering diagnosis despite having no family history. Medical experts note that while still rare, diagnoses in women under 40 are becoming more common, often involving more aggressive tumors. Coreno, now cancer-free after extensive treatment, emphasizes the importance of self-advocacy and seeking medical attention for any unusual health signs, regardless of age.</p>

          <p>A significant political gender gap has emerged among Generation Z in the United States, with young women identifying as leftist at a much higher rate than their male counterparts. This trend is attributed to their direct proximity to issues like reproductive rights, economic instability, and the perceived failures of both major political parties to address their concerns. Many young women feel that the term "liberal" no longer represents their anti-capitalist or more socially active stances. The article suggests that for these women, politics is not an abstract concept but a matter of self-defense in a world they see as increasingly precarious.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is expected to confirm Douglas Troutman, a chemical industry lobbyist, to lead the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. His nomination has alarmed environmental and public health advocates, who point out that the top four positions in the office will now be held by former industry insiders. Critics highlight Troutman's past efforts to repeal a California law requiring the disclosure of chemicals in cleaning products as evidence that he will prioritize corporate interests over public safety. This appointment is seen as part of a broader trend of deregulation and the weakening of protections against toxic substances.</p>

          <p>North Korea has showcased a new, powerful strategic missile during a recent military parade attended by Russian and Vietnamese officials. The existence of this weapon system was only recently disclosed, with Pyongyang describing it as its "most powerful nuclear strategic weapon." While the missile remains untested, North Korea did test a new solid-fuel rocket engine last month intended for future intercontinental ballistic missiles. This display of advancing military capability is seen as a potential move by Pyongyang to push Beijing towards more openly acknowledging North Korea's status as a nuclear power.</p>

Despite these tensions and a slow disengagement, the economic interdependence between the two nations, dubbed "Chimerica," remains significant, particularly in sectors like aerospace and high-performance semiconductors.

          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that two-thirds of Americans who get divorced eventually remarry. The study shows that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and remarried households often achieve a higher median net worth compared to those of divorced, single adults. This trend indicates that divorce, while a significant life event, is often a transitional phase rather than a permanent state for many. However, experts also caution that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce, particularly among older adults in what are termed "gray divorces."</p>

          <p>A network of progressive organizations is expecting millions of demonstrators to participate in "No Kings" marches across the United States this Saturday. The protests are a response to what organizers describe as President Trump's monarchical behavior and anti-democratic policies, citing concerns over immigration raids, environmental deregulation, and education cuts. This is the second major mobilization by the movement, following large-scale protests in June. While organizers emphasize a commitment to peaceful protest, some Republican governors have mobilized their National Guards in preparation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has labeled the event a "hate America rally."</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent suggestion that he might send federal forces to San Francisco to address crime has been met with widespread condemnation from the city's residents and political leaders. While acknowledging that the city faces challenges with homelessness and public safety, locals interviewed rejected the idea of military intervention as inappropriate and alarming. State and city officials, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and Dist. Atty. Brooke Jenkins, called the proposal an unnecessary, vindictive, and potentially illegal power play against a politically liberal city. The White House defended such deployments, citing crime reductions in other cities where they have occurred.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is reportedly preparing to run for Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat in 2026, a move that signals a potential end to an era in San Francisco politics. The decision ignites a high-profile race and raises questions about whether the 85-year-old Pelosi will seek another term. Wiener's undeclared campaign is likely motivated by the need to fundraise against a wealthy progressive challenger, Saikat Chakrabarti, who has already entered the race. This development brings the national Democratic debate about generational change to one of the party's most iconic districts.</p>

          <p>Native American tribes in California's Owens Valley are intensifying their fight to reclaim water rights from the city of Los Angeles, which has been pumping groundwater from the region for decades. Tribal leaders argue that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's extensive pumping has desiccated their ancestral homeland, drying up springs and meadows and harming the ecosystem. While L.A. officials maintain they are managing the groundwater sustainably, the tribes are seeking legal recognition of their water rights and additional lands for their reservations. This conflict highlights a long history of resource extraction and the ongoing struggle for tribal sovereignty.</p>

Police uncovered the scheme through phone location data and a recorded call where one twin noted their resemblance would prevent detection.
