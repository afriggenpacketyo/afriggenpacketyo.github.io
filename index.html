          <h2>Trump Urges Fed to Lower Rates Following Positive Jobs Report</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to decrease interest rates after the April jobs report exceeded expectations, citing the absence of inflation and the potential for further economic growth. In a Truth Social post, Trump emphasized the need for lower rates to benefit consumers and stimulate the economy, while also scaling back criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 in April, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate, leading to a rise in stock futures. Trump's continued efforts to influence the Fed's decision-making process highlight the ongoing tension between the executive branch and the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>A Reuters photographer captured an image of Michael Waltz's phone screen during a White House cabinet meeting, revealing conversations with top Trump administration officials on a modified version of the Signal messaging app. The screen showed communications with Vice President JD Vance, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, raising concerns about handling sensitive information. The White House confirmed that Signal is an approved app for government phones, but the incident has prompted scrutiny given Waltz's previous Signal-related security lapse where he accidentally included a journalist in a group chat discussing military operations in Yemen. Waltz has since been nominated to be ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence service has classified the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as an extremist party, granting authorities greater surveillance powers. The classification follows a 1,100-page report detailing the AfD's advocacy of an ethnic concept of the people that discriminates against entire population groups and treats citizens with a migrant background as second-class Germans. This decision has sparked debate about banning the party, which some polls show as the most popular in the country, and the AfD has dismissed the classification as a political move. The party, known for leaders trivializing the Holocaust and denigrating foreigners, still garnered an endorsement from Elon Musk during the campaign before elections in February.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his appeal in a U.K. court regarding the downgrading of his official security detail following his decision to step down as a working member of the royal family and relocate to the United States. Harry argued that private bodyguards are insufficient due to their inability to carry guns or access government security networks. He stated that the U.K. is his home and central to his children's heritage, but safety concerns prevent them from feeling at home there. The court upheld the previous ruling that allowed the British government to scale back his close protection detail.</p>

The Conservatives lost the mayoralty in Cambridgeshire & Peterborough to Labour, and Reform UK is making significant gains in council seats across England, with a vote share of approximately 35%.

          <p>Vietnam is implementing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and centralize political power under the Communist Party. Spearheaded by new party chief To Lam, the reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating 100,000 public sector jobs. The government also plans to reduce provinces and municipalities from 63 to 34, streamlining local governance and replicating this two-tier system within the Party, military, and judiciary. These changes aim to address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign and prepare Vietnam for economic challenges, with the goal of achieving high-income status by 2045.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that his administration will revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating the ongoing conflict with the Ivy League school. This action follows the freezing of $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts after Harvard rejected demands to discontinue diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and change hiring practices. Trump has accused Harvard of abusing its tax-exempt status, while the university argues that the designation supports its educational mission, enabling scholarships, research, and technological advancements. The IRS was reportedly considering this move prior to Trump's public statements, and Harvard is expected to challenge the decision legally.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently higher than they have been in years, providing an opportunity for savers to earn a return that outpaces inflation. National average CD rates vary by term, with one-year CDs yielding around 2.01% APY, while top online banks offer rates as high as 4.50% APY for six-month CDs. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and opting for short-term CDs, which currently offer higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by purchasing CDs with varying terms, is one approach to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

However, government data revealed an increase in Americans filing for unemployment benefits, and the nation's gross domestic product shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter.

          <p>As of May 2, 2025, the price of gold is $3,249.68 per ounce, influenced by factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge, with its price inversely proportional to interest rates. Economic uncertainty and political instability tend to drive up gold prices, while fluctuations in the U.S. dollar's strength can also impact its value. Investors should monitor these factors to make informed decisions regarding gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order seeking to cut federal funding for NPR and PBS, accusing the news outlets of biased coverage and “left-wing propaganda.” The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to end federal funding for the broadcasters, although the immediate impact remains unclear due to the corporation's funding structure. The White House has criticized the outlets' coverage of various topics, and the order also aims to cut indirect funding by forbidding public radio and television broadcasters from using federal funds for NPR or PBS programs. NPR and PBS have defended their editorial independence and emphasized the devastating impact that eliminating funding would have on communities relying on public media.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the closure of 25 U.S. Geological Service (USGS) water science centers that monitor water levels for flooding and drought. These centers play a critical role in protecting human life, property, and water supplies by tracking ground and surface water quality.

The PAF's decision to showcase these weapons highlights the ongoing military buildup in the region and the strategic alliance between Pakistan and China.

          <p>South Africa faces the dual challenges of rising sea levels and drought due to climate change, with research indicating that parts of the country are slowly lifting out of the ocean due to water loss. Coastal cities like Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth experience erosion, flooding, and habitat loss, while drought-induced water loss causes land uplift of about two millimeters per year. While this uplift may appear to buffer against rising seas, it comes at the expense of water scarcity, requiring integrated climate and ocean policies to address the complex challenges.</p>
