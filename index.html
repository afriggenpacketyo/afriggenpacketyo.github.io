          <p>An Israeli airstrike on the Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced families, resulted in the deaths of at least 35 people, with reports indicating that many bodies, including those of children, were severely burned. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed to have targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control center in the area, accusing Hamas of using the Gazan population as human shields. The IDF stated that the targeted area was being used by terrorists to plan attacks against Israeli civilians and troops, while video footage showed large fires consuming parts of the school, with graphic images of victims. This attack is part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in northern Gaza over the past week.</p>

He expressed his determination to retain his title, stating that he risked his life for the win, while the women's race was won by Ava Sender Logan, who ran in support of the Refugee Community Kitchen. The annual event, dating back centuries, attracts thousands of spectators and competitors, though it was officially scrapped in 2010 due to safety concerns.</p>

          <p>FBI deputy director Dan Bongino announced that the agency is reopening or increasing resources for investigations into three high-profile cases: the 2021 D.C. pipe bombings, the 2022 leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, and the 2023 discovery of cocaine at the White House. Bongino stated that he and the Director evaluated cases of potential public corruption that have garnered public interest and decided to re-open or push additional resources to these cases, and he has requested weekly updates. The earliest case that Bongino announced was being reexamined occurred when pipe bombs were discovered by a passerby around 1 p.m. Jan. 6, 2021, at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and near the Republican National Committee headquarters as Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election results.</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from New York City and the last surviving member of the "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94, according to a statement from his family. Rangel served in the House of Representatives for 46 years and was a Korean War veteran and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout his career, Rangel fought for affordable housing, urban revitalization, fair tax policies, and equal opportunities, and he was the first Black chair of the House's Ways and Means Committee. He faced ethics violations in 2008, leading to a censure in 2010, but remained a respected figure in Harlem.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump accused Harvard University of being "very slow" in providing information on foreign students, suggesting this was to conceal radicalized individuals who should not be allowed back into the country. He also stated he was considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard to trade schools across the U.S., which he believes would be a better investment. These statements follow a temporary restraining order granted to Harvard by a judge, preventing the government from revoking the university's certification to host international students. The Department of Homeland Security had previously informed Harvard that it lost its privilege of enrolling foreign students due to non-compliance with requests for information and perpetuating an unsafe environment for Jewish students.</p>

Trump said Putin is killing a lot of people and that he doesn't know what happened to Putin, stating that he has always gotten along with him but that he doesn't like the Russian leader sending rockets into cities and killing people. He also stated that he would consider more sanctions on Russia, and the Ukrainian Air Force said the Russian attack was the largest aerial assault of the war. The Kremlin played down Trump's remarks, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggesting Trump's comments could be blamed on "emotional overload."</p>

The White House defended Trump's actions, asserting the administration's right to control immigration and national security policies, and the Trump administration also aims to exert control over the university's policies, including halting Harvard's diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>

          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a "true rate" of unemployment is much higher, standing at 24.3% in April. LISEP's measure includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time employment but unable to find it, and individuals in poverty-wage jobs. This indicator seeks to capture nuances missed by traditional economic data, revealing that millions of households struggle to maintain a minimal quality of life. The "true rate" of unemployment also highlights disparities among racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers facing greater challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats are reportedly shifting away from using jargon favored by activists in an effort to win back voters who supported Donald Trump. Party figures have expressed concern that phrases like "Latinx" and an emphasis on issues such as pronouns have alienated ordinary voters. Some Democrats believe that using simpler language can help them connect with a broader range of people, as not everyone is familiar with the latest terminology. The shift comes after criticisms of figures like Kamala Harris for using "word salad" responses during interviews and a perception that Democrats are out of touch with regular people.</p>

          <p>Taylor Fritz and Emma Navarro, two of the top American seeds, experienced significant upsets in the first round of the French Open. Taylor Fritz, the runner-up at the previous year's US Open, was defeated by Daniel Altmaier, while Emma Navarro was quickly eliminated by Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. The losses mark a setback for both players, with Fritz being the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since 2007, and Navarro having previously reached the fourth round in Paris. This is not Altmaier’s first big win at the French Open, as he beat No 8 seed Matteo Berrettini there in 2020, and Sinner in 2023.</p>

          <p>Peter Magyar, Hungary's opposition leader, walked from Budapest to northwestern Romania to gain support from ethnic Hungarians, a vital voter group in Hungarian elections. Magyar's walk, part of a series of political actions, aimed to address the concerns of Hungarians and signal the end of Viktor Orban's era, and Orban has accused Magyar and his party of working for the Ukrainian secret service and being traitors. Recent polls suggest Magyar and his Tisza Party could defeat Orban's Fidesz in the next election, due in 2026, because he denounces corruption and the state of public infrastructure, and he is widening his political strategy by focusing on ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries.</p>

The other tombs date back to the 18th Dynasty and include one belonging to Baki, who served as a supervisor of the grain silo, and another containing the burial of an individual named “S,” who held multiple roles.

Trump initially called for a 50% tariff on EU goods, accusing the bloc of being "very difficult to deal with," but he later agreed to delay the tariffs to July 9 following a call from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest he may favor a world order where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their own sphere of influence. This vision, reminiscent of 19th-century imperialism, involves the U.S. exerting control in the Western Hemisphere while potentially diminishing its global military presence, which could benefit Russia and China. While some analysts dismiss this as a strategic vision, Trump's pursuit of territorial expansion and his praise of leaders like Putin and Xi suggest a desire to reshape the global order. However, challenges persist in establishing spheres of influence in the post-imperial age, as evidenced by resistance from countries like Canada and Greenland.</p>
