          <p>Apple has raised the monthly subscription price for its Apple TV+ streaming service to $12.99 in the U.S. and other markets, marking the third increase in three years. The new price applies immediately to new subscribers, while current subscribers will see the change after their next renewal date. This move follows similar price hikes by competitors like Netflix and Peacock, as streaming companies aim to fund new content and improve profitability. Despite its popularity, the service has reportedly been operating at a significant financial loss for the company.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Schmid has indicated hesitation regarding a widely anticipated interest rate cut in September, stating that policymakers need more definitive data on inflation. Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid pushed back against market expectations, suggesting the Fed still has work to do to reach its 2% inflation target. His comments introduce a note of uncertainty into monetary policy, contrasting with pressure from the White House for lower rates to stimulate the economy. Schmid is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), has been placed under government control following a compulsory winding-up order from insolvency courts. This action creates an uncertain future for nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. The company, part of Sanjeev Gupta's metals empire, collapsed under hundreds of millions of pounds in debt. The government has committed to covering the plant's ongoing wages and costs while it actively seeks a new buyer to secure the facility's future.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the monetary penalty of over $500 million imposed on President Donald Trump and other defendants in his civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the fine was excessive and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, had resulted in a judge finding Trump liable for fraudulently overvaluing his assets. While the financial penalty was struck down, the court upheld the non-monetary injunctive relief measures designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has backed down from imposing high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union as part of a new trade agreement. Previously, these sectors faced potential tariffs of up to 250%, but they will now be limited to 15%, aligning with most other goods in the deal. In return, the EU has agreed to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods. This development provides significant relief to European exporters, particularly Ireland's major pharmaceutical industry, and brings more stability to the transatlantic trade relationship after months of intense negotiations.</p>

          <p>Rising country singer Gavin Adcock has publicly criticized fellow artist Zach Bryan, questioning his character and the authenticity of his public image. Adcock condemned Bryan for an allegedly rude response to a 14-year-old fan and suggested that Bryan “puts on a big mask” and sometimes shows his “true colors.” The criticism stems from a reported incident where Bryan dismissed a young fan seeking an autograph after a concert. Adcock's comments add to a public feud, as he had previously called out Bryan on social media for the same issue, highlighting the importance of artists respecting their fanbase.</p>

          <p>Walmart has raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook, driven by strong e-commerce growth and resilient consumer spending, though it noted that costs from tariffs are increasing. The retailer's U.S. comparable sales grew by 4.6% in the second quarter, exceeding expectations, with its online business expanding by 26%. Despite this strong performance, the company's shares fell as its adjusted earnings per share missed Wall Street estimates due to one-time expenses. Walmart's report offers a key insight into the U.S. economy, showing that consumers continue to spend even as the company navigates the financial impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study examining wolf management in the Western U.S. suggests that public wolf hunting has a negligible impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Research conducted in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington found that killing a wolf saved only a tiny fraction of a single cow, meaning about 14 wolves would need to be killed to prevent one livestock death. The findings challenge the long-held assumption that reducing wolf populations directly curtails depredation. Researchers emphasize that the study is not about the ethics of hunting but aims to identify effective management tools to mitigate human-wildlife conflict and support ranchers.</p>

This desire for personal acclaim may prevent a complete sellout of Ukrainian interests, as a deal requires the willing participation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders to be considered legitimate by the Nobel committee. The article argues that historical comparisons to Munich or Yalta are misplaced, as Russia is in a weaker position and Ukraine, with strong European support, has more leverage than those historical precedents suggest.</p>

A key factor in the decision was Eze's childhood connection to Arsenal, where he played in the academy, making the choice to join the Gunners an easy one.

          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, financial experts suggest that a home equity loan can be a strategic tool for homeowners to save money. These loans can be particularly effective for consolidating high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, by converting variable-rate debt into a lower, fixed-rate payment. Another beneficial use is financing home improvements that increase a property's value, as the interest on such loans may be tax-deductible. However, experts caution against using home equity for luxury purchases or daily expenses and stress the importance of having stable income and sufficient equity before borrowing.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who have been imprisoned for over three decades for the 1989 murders of their parents, are scheduled for parole hearings this week. The brothers, convicted in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole, have long maintained they acted in self-defense after years of severe abuse. Their sentences were recently reduced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The hearings come amid renewed public interest and new evidence supporting their abuse claims, though the current Los Angeles District Attorney opposes their release. A decision on their freedom is expected shortly after each hearing.</p>

          <p>A rural football academy in northern Bangladesh is playing a crucial role in the recent rise of the nation's women's teams, which have qualified for continental championships for the first time. Founded in 2014 by a former teacher, the Rangatungi United Women's Football Academy has overcome social and religious conservatism to provide opportunities for girls in a low-income region. The academy has produced several national players, including 17-year-old star Mosammat Sagorika, helping to change local attitudes toward women in sports. Despite financial challenges, the academy's success highlights the potential for grassroots development to elevate sports on a national level.</p>

          <p>Tesco has raised the price of its lunchtime meal deal, citing rising food costs in the UK. For customers with a Clubcard, the price of a main, snack, and drink will increase from £3.60 to £3.85, while non-members will see a rise from £4 to £4.25. This follows a price hike in 2022, which ended a decade of the deal being priced at £3. The move reflects broader food price inflation and the increasing use of loyalty card schemes by supermarkets to compete for customers by offering tiered pricing. Tesco stated that the deal continues to offer great value.</p>

          <p>Israel has given final approval for a contentious settlement project known as E1, located in the occupied West Bank. Critics, including Palestinians and international rights groups, warn that the development would effectively sever the northern West Bank from the south, undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state. The project, which includes around 3,500 new housing units, had been frozen for years due to international pressure. Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich framed the approval as a direct response to countries that have recently moved to recognize a Palestinian state, vowing to continue settlement expansion.</p>

          <p>Author and professor Walter Isaacson has described President Donald Trump's recent dealings with chipmakers Intel and Nvidia as a "scattershot method of crony capitalism." Isaacson argued that such state capitalism, where the government favors specific companies, is a recipe for corruption and economic inefficiency. His comments refer to the administration's push for a stake in Intel after Trump publicly criticized its CEO, and a recent agreement requiring Nvidia and AMD to pay the U.S. government a percentage of their China revenues for export licenses. Isaacson contends this approach will not successfully revive American manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

Different grades of staff, including engineers, station staff, and train operators, will walk out at different times throughout the week. TfL has urged the RMT to accept its pay offer and continue discussions, but maintains that a reduction in the contractual 35-hour work week is not feasible.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate on a five-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%, dipping below the 5% threshold for the first time since May 2023. This milestone, along with a recent drop in two-year fixed rates, signals a trend of steadily falling borrowing costs and increased competition among lenders. While the immediate financial savings for borrowers may be modest, such symbolic turning points can boost buyer confidence in the housing market. Experts note that despite this positive news, the prospect of higher-for-longer central bank rates may limit how much further mortgage rates can fall in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

Her case and sentence have sparked a debate on free speech and proportionality, with critics like Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch arguing her punishment was harsher than that given to those who physically rioted.

However, experts point to Beijing's historical precedent of avoiding such binding commitments and its resource constraints as major obstacles. It remains unclear what form of "guarantee" was discussed, but China is not expected to take a high-profile, formal role in ensuring Ukraine's future security.</p>

          <p>The recent termination of a 24-year-old Texas law that granted in-state tuition to undocumented students is causing confusion and forcing many to alter their college plans. The policy was ended after state and federal officials argued it discriminated against out-of-state U.S. citizens. Now, students like Ximena, who has attended U.S. schools since kindergarten, face tuition costs more than doubling, making four-year universities unaffordable. Immigration advocates worry that the abrupt change will not only harm students but also negatively impact the state's future workforce by creating barriers to higher education for long-term Texas residents.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a decline. The rise is attributed to a slight dip in mortgage rates during the period when these contracts were likely signed.

While some preliminary data suggests a possible decline from a peak in early 2025, the sample sizes are small and have wide margins of error.

Guevara, a Salvadoran immigrant who founded the social media-based MG News, has been in detention for nearly two months despite having local charges against him dropped. The ACLU contends his imprisonment is intended to silence his reporting on ICE activities, which is popular with his Spanish-speaking audience, and violates his First and Fifth Amendment rights. An immigration judge had previously granted Guevara bond, but ICE appealed the decision, keeping him detained.</p>
