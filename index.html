          <p>Faustin Nsabumukunzi, a Rwandan beekeeper living in the Hamptons, has been charged with immigration fraud for allegedly concealing his participation in the Rwandan genocide. Prosecutors claim Nsabumukunzi directed Hutus to kill Tutsis, personally attacked Tutsis, and ordered the disposal of Tutsi bodies, all while lying about his involvement when seeking refugee status and citizenship in the United States. He faces up to 30 years in prison and potential deportation to Rwanda, where he has been wanted for nearly two decades. The case highlights the long reach of justice and the complexities of immigration and accountability for past atrocities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funds to sanctuary cities and counties that limit cooperation with U.S. immigration officials. The judge declared portions of Trump's executive orders unconstitutional, citing irreparable harm to these jurisdictions through budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust with their communities. This ruling echoes a similar challenge during Trump's first term and underscores the ongoing legal battles over immigration policy and federal overreach. The decision reaffirms the principle that local governments can maintain their missions and community trust without being forced to participate in federal deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, has advocated for a "coalition" of countries to confront the tariff policies implemented by the US President. Speaking in Beijing, Cassis emphasized that these tariffs have created uncertainty for all nations, including those traditionally aligned with the United States. He highlighted China's role as a crucial partner in promoting a multilateral world and noted the significant impact of the tariffs on Switzerland's small, open economy. Cassis stressed the need for international cooperation to mitigate the negative effects of protectionist measures.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that China could enhance its soft power in Africa by adopting a non-governmental organization (NGO) model for its foreign engagement. While China has heavily invested in infrastructure projects, these initiatives often lack grassroots engagement and community involvement. The author argues that emulating Western nations' vibrant NGO ecosystems could improve China's public image and foster stronger human connections across the continent. This approach could address criticisms of China as a neocolonial power and promote more sustainable and inclusive development.</p>

          <p>Supported housing, which provides independent living assistance to vulnerable individuals, is facing a severe crisis due to funding cuts, according to an open letter signed by over 170 organizations. One in three providers in England had to shut down services last year, leading to a shortfall of approximately 325,000 places. The letter, addressed to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, blames cuts to council funding and rising costs, warning that another third of providers may close without increased government support. The crisis threatens essential services for young care leavers, veterans, and those escaping homelessness and domestic abuse.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may not yield the promised savings due to incurred costs. While Musk initially pledged significant savings, the actual amount is likely to be far less, potentially around $150 billion. Firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave for thousands of workers are estimated to cost upwards of $135 billion this fiscal year, potentially erasing any savings achieved through DOGE's initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is dismantling the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a foreign aid agency established during the George W.

The agency, which focuses on promoting economic growth in low-to-middle-income countries through private sector investments, faces major staff cuts and termination of existing grants. The move contrasts with the agency's bipartisan support and its reputation for transparency and effectiveness. Critics argue that dismantling MCC would undermine a successful model of foreign aid and damage the U.S.'s reputation as a reliable partner.</p>
