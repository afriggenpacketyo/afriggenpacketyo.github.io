          <p>Jim Cramer discussed stocks favored by younger investors, focusing on those often overlooked by Wall Street analysts.

          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, shifting production of two Mexican-produced vehicles to the U.S. plants. The investment is seen as a response to President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. GM will add assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox to U.S. plants and convert an idled plant in Michigan to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks. The move will enable GM to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
