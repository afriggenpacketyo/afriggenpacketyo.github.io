          <p>Vice President JD Vance traveled to Los Angeles to assess the federal response to recent protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. Vance toured a Federal Joint Operations Center and a mobile command center, engaging with law enforcement and Marines deployed to protect federal property. The deployment follows President Trump's decision to federalize thousands of California National Guard troops and prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles, leading to widespread demonstrations. A federal appeals court has allowed President Trump to maintain control over the National Guard troops despite objections from California's governor. The optimism score is reasonably calculated based on the author's reflection of the events described.</p>

The incident was captured by a Ring doorbell camera, which alerted Flynn's daughter, who witnessed the attack remotely. The judge described the attack as savage, ferocious, and merciless, highlighting the horrific nature of the crime.

          <p>As the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda prepare to sign a US-mediated peace agreement, concerns are rising among civic organizations about the lack of emphasis on justice for crimes committed by armed groups. Analysts caution that including clauses for amnesty in such deals could embolden militia groups and perpetuate a cycle of violence. The agreement aims to end fighting in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have made significant advances, but the details remain largely undisclosed to the Congolese public. The US hopes this agreement will bring economic opportunities to the mineral-rich region, with a potential minerals exchange deal worth around $2 trillion for US companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller's suggestion of a potential interest rate cut as early as July has sparked debate amid concerns about inflation and labor market weakness. Waller's argument that tariffs would only cause a one-time price increase is being challenged by rising oil prices and a declining dollar, which could lead to more lasting inflationary pressures. Additionally, the rising unemployment rate among recent college graduates, potentially due to technological advancements like AI, raises questions about the effectiveness of interest rate reductions. The article suggests a cautious approach, highlighting lessons from Fed history and the need to consider various economic factors before implementing rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to legalize assisted dying, passing the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill by a margin of 23 votes. The bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, now moves to the House of Lords for further scrutiny. The proposed law would allow terminally ill individuals meeting specific criteria to end their lives with medical assistance. Key conditions include being over 18, living in England or Wales, having a terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less, and satisfying two independent doctors of their eligibility.</p>

          <p>A study analyzing nearly two billion words from various online sources has found that Americans swear more frequently than other English-speaking groups. Linguists from the University of Queensland assessed online news stories, company websites, blogs, and other web sources across 20 English-speaking regions. The study suggests that the anonymity of the internet may contribute to the higher rate of vulgarity among Americans online. The British ranked second in the use of vulgar language, followed by Australians, Singaporeans, and New Zealanders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles. The court's decision overturns a lower court ruling, allowing oil and gas companies to argue that California's waiver to set tougher standards than federal rules causes financial harm. California has a goal to only allow the sale of zero-emission cars by 2035, and other states are allowed to copy California's stricter standards. Environmentalists and California's Democratic leadership have defended the waiver, arguing that it promotes vehicle innovation and reduces greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with the first driverless trip from the factory to a customer's house anticipated on June 28.

Elon Musk has been promoting the driverless robotaxi concept for years, and analysts believe it could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization. The service will launch with a limited number of vehicles, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco later.</p>

While some locals recognize the need for improved traffic management, others find the size of the box junction "ridiculous" and hope it might become a tourist attraction.

The music feels unshackled, with the songs exploring a purely internal, self-directed struggle. The narrators of these songs don't worry about betraying an oath or straying from a traditional role; friends and family figure in only as concerned characters wondering whether their newly single buddy is okay.</p>
