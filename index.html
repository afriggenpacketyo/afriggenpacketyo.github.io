          <p>This article from DW discusses the dangers of thrombosis, a condition where blood clots form in blood vessels, blocking blood flow, even for top athletes like basketball superstar Victor Wembanyama and tennis icon Serena Williams, who have had to deal with it. Sports physician Pascal Bauer explains that athletes are not immune to the condition and that repetitive arm movements in sports like ice hockey, handball, basketball, volleyball, baseball, and tennis can increase the risk. The article also highlights the importance of preventive sports examinations, good training hygiene, and staying hydrated to reduce the risk of thrombosis, and it also mentions the use of blood-thinning medication as a treatment.</p>

Analysts suggest that China may also be seeking to restore ties with neighboring countries, including South Korea, through cultural diplomacy, and the reintroduction of K-pop could foster regional goodwill and the approval for K-pop group Epex's concert is a "policy test case" that could pave the way for larger acts.</p>
