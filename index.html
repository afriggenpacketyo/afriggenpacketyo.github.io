          <p>A fire has erupted in the cargo hold of a bulk carrier ship named Altay, which was docked at Albert Dock in Hull and carrying scrap metal. Emergency services, including four fire engines and the coastguard, are on the scene, and all crew members have been accounted for safely. Due to a large plume of foul-smelling smoke drifting towards the city center, local authorities have closed several roads and shops as a precaution. A nearby children's literary festival was also evacuated to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>Amid a shifting economic landscape where inflation has cooled, this article explores the potential returns of investing in a three-year certificate of deposit (CD). With current rates for such CDs ranging between 4.00% and 4.15%, a $10,000 deposit could yield between $1,248 and $1,297 in interest over 36 months. The article highlights the benefit of locking in these fixed rates, providing a predictable and guaranteed return in an uncertain interest rate environment. It contrasts this stability with the variable rates of money market accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

Average rates for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.87%, while a 15-year mortgage is near 6.06%, with similar figures for refinancing. The article suggests that while rates are higher than in previous years, there are strategies to secure a better deal, such as improving one's credit score and shopping around with different lenders.

The summary acknowledges CEO Bob Iger's successful turnaround efforts, which have improved profitability and restored Wall Street's confidence in the entertainment giant.

          <p>A team of researchers in China has discovered a "genetic switch" that could enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically limited to animals like salamanders. Their study, published in the journal *Science*, found that mammals' inability to regenerate stems from a failure to produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound derived from vitamin A. By reactivating the specific DNA pathway responsible for this acid's production, the scientists were able to successfully trigger ear tissue regeneration in mice. This breakthrough could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in humans.</p>

          <p>The potential inclusion of alternative investments like cryptocurrency and private equity in 401(k) plans is generating controversy. Following the Labor Department's rescission of cautionary guidance on crypto and reported White House interest in private equity access, a debate has emerged over the risks and rewards for everyday retirement savers. Proponents, like BlackRock's CEO, argue it "democratizes" access to high-return assets, but investor advocates warn these options are volatile, expensive, and lack transparency. Critics argue such complex and illiquid assets are inappropriate for the core, long-term savings of average workers. (not investment advice)</p>

Adams, who is now running as an independent, contrasted his own background of overcoming struggle with what he characterized as Mamdani's privileged upbringing.

          <p>Habibur Masum has been found guilty of murdering his wife, Kulsuma Akter, in a brutal knife attack in Bradford city center. Masum stabbed the 27-year-old more than 25 times while she was pushing their infant son in a pram, who was unharmed. The court heard that Ms. Akter had been living in a women's refuge after Masum had previously threatened her, and he had stalked her and tracked her location before the attack. Despite pleading guilty to manslaughter, the jury convicted him of murder, and he is scheduled for sentencing in July.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced the United States will withdraw from Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. This article strongly criticizes the decision, arguing it will have disastrous consequences for global child mortality. Gavi is credited with saving millions of lives by providing vaccines in lower-income countries, and the US has historically been a major funder. The author contends that pulling out, based on what they describe as unfounded vaccine skepticism, will lead to over a million preventable child deaths and endanger global health.</p>

          <p>Researchers believe they may have found the oldest rocks on Earth, dating back 4.16 billion years, within Canada's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in Quebec.
