The effort faces resistance from both conservative hardliners and moderate members who are displeased with changes made to the bill in the Senate. As the vote stretched late into the night, several GOP defections threatened to derail the bill's passage, despite intense public pressure from Trump for his party to unite and approve the measure.</p>

The government was forced to make last-minute concessions to its proposals to overhaul disability benefits to avoid a humiliating defeat from a large-scale rebellion within its own ranks. Starmer took responsibility for the tumultuous episode, stating he "did not get that process right" amid questions about his authority.</p>

          <p>Senior United Nations officials have issued a stark warning that Haiti's gangs now exert "near-total control" over the capital, Port-au-Prince, with state authority rapidly shrinking. An estimated 90% of the city is dominated by criminal groups who are expanding their influence, paralyzing legal commerce, and establishing parallel governance structures in the absence of public services. The UN cautioned that without greater international action, a total collapse of the state's presence in the capital is a very real possibility.</p>

The author contrasts Kershaw's enduring flame of a career with Koufax's brilliant but shorter meteor-like peak to make the case for his unparalleled greatness.</p>

Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, a tie in the House means the question or measure being voted on is defeated. The rule states that a tied question "shall be lost." This mechanism has become particularly relevant given the razor-thin Republican majority, where even a few defections can endanger the passage of key legislation.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has seen a dramatic resurgence, with fundraising volumes jumping eightfold to $14 billion in the first half of this year compared to 2024. This boom is primarily driven by a wave of mainland Chinese companies seeking to list in the city, a trend supported by favorable policies from Beijing, ample market liquidity, and strong investor confidence. The renewed activity positions Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>
