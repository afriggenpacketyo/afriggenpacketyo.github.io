          <p>In Leeds, West Yorkshire Police responded to a concerning incident where two women sustained serious injuries from a crossbow and firearm attack. The incident occurred in the Headingley area, leading to road closures in the Otley Road area as authorities investigated. A 38-year-old man, believed to be the attacker, was arrested after suffering a self-inflicted injury and was subsequently hospitalized. Both women are also receiving treatment in the hospital, and the police are continuing their investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the attack.</p>

          <p>Russia claims to have regained full control over the Kursk region from Ukrainian forces, stating that the last village held by Ukrainian troops has been recaptured after months of fighting. This claim is disputed by Ukraine, which insists its troops are still conducting operations in the region. The Russian military also acknowledged the involvement of North Korean troops in their counter-offensive. Amidst these conflicting reports, the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) indicates that Russian forces have recently advanced near the international border in Kursk Oblast, while fighting continues in the Belgorod region.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns' decision to draft Shedeur Sanders in the NFL Draft has sparked debate, with some fans questioning the team's enthusiasm for the player based on the lukewarm reactions of head coach Kevin Stefanski and general manager Andrew Berry. Despite Berry's later explanation that drafting Sanders was not necessarily the plan, some observers interpreted the initial reactions as a lack of genuine excitement about the pick. Adding to the intrigue, Deion Sanders, Shedeur's father, had previously suggested that young quarterbacks should avoid playing for Cleveland, creating a complex backdrop to the team's selection of the quarterback.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing the apprehension of an undocumented immigrant has sparked concerns about the Trump administration's potential intimidation of the judiciary. Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments implying that judges who anger the administration will be prosecuted have fueled these fears. Critics argue that such actions undermine the independence of the judiciary and could chill judges' willingness to make impartial decisions. This situation raises questions about the separation of powers and the potential for executive overreach in the legal system.</p>

The surveys reveal concerns about Trump's focus on the right priorities and his handling of the economy, trade, and immigration, indicating a growing dissatisfaction among voters.

          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as the first-ever vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a move seen as designating a successor. Al-Sheikh, a veteran leader of Abbas' Fatah movement, is now the frontrunner to succeed the 89-year-old Abbas. The appointment is unlikely to improve the image of Fatah among Palestinians, many of whom view the party as corrupt and out of touch. Abbas has been under pressure from Western and Arab allies to reform the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on how organizations should interpret the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex in law.

It also states that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use.

The arrest stems from allegations that Dugan helped a man evade U.S. immigration officers at her courthouse.
