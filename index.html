          <p>Citing fire safety concerns, Southwest Airlines is introducing a new policy for travelers with lithium-powered wheelchairs and scooters. Effective September 25, passengers must remove detachable lithium batteries from their devices and carry them into the cabin. The airline stated that these batteries have become a common source of smoke and fire incidents on aircraft, emphasizing that quick access is crucial for safety. By 2026, a size restriction of 300 watt-hours will also be enforced, making Southwest one of the first U.S. carriers to adopt such standards.</p>

The ruling found that Khalil had misrepresented his background on his green card application, and the judge denied a waiver, citing a lack of candor. Khalil's lawyers argue the decision is retaliation from the Trump administration for his free speech and plan to appeal. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that advocating for violence and harassing others revokes the privilege of residing in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely, following pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, civil rights groups, and Hollywood figures. The suspension came after Kimmel's monologue about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Critics are framing the network's action as a dangerous capitulation to government censorship and an attack on First Amendment rights. This event follows the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, fueling a broader debate about media independence under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr defended the actions leading to the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," asserting the host appeared to mislead the public about the killing of Charlie Kirk. Carr suggested the FCC might take further action against ABC's parent company, Disney, stating broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. He framed the event as part of a "massive shift" in the media ecosystem enabled by the Trump administration's election, ominously adding, "we're not done yet." His comments have intensified the debate over government influence on media content.</p>

          <p>A newly constituted vaccine advisory panel for the CDC, appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has begun debating potential changes to childhood vaccine recommendations. The committee's first major discussion centered on whether to alter guidance for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (MMRV) shot for young children due to a slightly increased risk of fever-related seizures.

          <p>The head of England and Wales's Crown Prosecution Service has stated that no "outside pressure" influenced the decision to drop spying charges against two British men accused of working for China. The case against a former parliamentary researcher and a teacher was dismissed after the CPS determined the evidence did not meet the legal threshold for trial. The prosecutor noted that under the old Official Secrets Act, a conviction would have required proving China was an "enemy." The decision has drawn significant criticism from UK government officials who expressed deep disappointment.</p>

          <p>The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has triggered calls for a public boycott against parent company Disney and major broadcast groups like Nexstar and Sinclair. Advocacy groups are framing the network's decision, which followed pressure from the FCC chairman, as an act of "state-sanctioned censorship" and are urging consumers to voice their objections. The move by Nexstar, which is currently seeking FCC approval for a merger, is seen by critics as evidence of media conglomerates capitulating to government pressure to protect their business interests.

A federal judge in Washington D.C. blocked the government from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, sharply criticizing the administration's unsubstantiated claim that the children's parents wanted them returned. Separately, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court's ruling that the administration had unlawfully tried to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. These judicial decisions represent a major check on the executive branch's recent aggressive deportation efforts.</p>

The administration uses these platforms to bypass traditional media, set its agenda, and reward allies, creating a "government by the podcasters, for the podcasters."

          <p>Elon Musk's fellowship in the prestigious Royal Society is under review following controversial remarks he made via video at a right-wing rally in London. Musk criticized "uncontrolled migration" and stated, "You either fight back or you die," which prompted the society's president, Sir Adrian Smith, to express concern over the "language of violence." In a letter to fellows, Smith said the matter would be discussed at the next council meeting, noting that threats to values of tolerance and respect are now real. This is not the first time Musk's position in the UK's national academy of sciences has been debated.</p>

          <p>A team of eight female athletes is preserving a rich piece of Mexican culture in California through the traditional equestrian sport of escaramuza. The performances involve synchronized, intricate maneuvers on horseback while riding sidesaddle in ornate traditional dresses, a nod to the "adelitas" or women of the Mexican Revolution. The sport requires a deep bond between rider and horse, as well as intense training and precision. For the young women on the team, participating in escaramuza is a way to stay connected to their roots, honor their heritage, and bring recognition to a culturally significant, female-driven sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Trump has announced his intention to designate Antifa as a "major terrorist organisation." Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a decentralized, leaderless movement of far-left activists who oppose fascism and other right-wing ideologies. Experts question the legality and practicality of such a designation, as Antifa is considered an ideology rather than a formal organization, and U.S. law has no mechanism for designating domestic terror groups. Critics of the movement point to its activists' willingness to use violence, while legal experts warn that such a designation could infringe on First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that the United States is actively trying to regain control of Bagram airbase, its former largest military installation in Afghanistan. During a press conference in the UK, Trump highlighted the base's strategic importance, noting its proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites. The base was surrendered during the chaotic US withdrawal in 2021, an action Trump has heavily criticized. His comments suggest a potential negotiation with the Taliban, who currently control the facility, to allow American forces to return, raising significant geopolitical questions about future US strategy in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, seeking permission to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The administration argues that the president has the authority to fire her for "cause" based on allegations that she committed mortgage fraud before her appointment, a claim Cook denies. The Justice Department asserts that the president's judgment on what constitutes cause should not be second-guessed by lower courts, which have so far blocked her removal. The case represents a significant challenge to the independence of the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis announced that the struggling carrier will slash its flight capacity by 25% in November and that more job cuts are imminent as it navigates its second bankruptcy in under a year. In a memo to employees, Davis stated the airline is optimizing its network to focus on its strongest markets and is in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors to reduce costs. The discount airline has been hit hard by high costs and shifting travel demand, and a failed merger with JetBlue left it to restructure on its own. The company is now in talks with its pilot and flight attendant unions about the impending cuts.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 22 state attorneys general and over 250 advocacy organizations has formally opposed a proposed Trump administration rule that would narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The new regulation aims to disqualify employees of organizations involved in work the administration dislikes, such as those dealing with immigration or public protests. Critics argue the rule is unconstitutional, illegal, and a betrayal of the promise made to millions of public servants who took on student debt with the expectation of future relief. They contend it weaponizes the student loan system to punish employers.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, accusing the companies of facilitating ticket scalping by brokers. The suit alleges that Ticketmaster knowingly ignored brokers who violated ticket purchasing limits, allowing them to buy large quantities of tickets for resale at inflated prices. This practice allegedly generated $3.7 billion in resale fees for Ticketmaster between 2019 and 2024. The lawsuit, which follows intense scrutiny after the botched sale of Taylor Swift concert tickets, accuses the live entertainment giant of violating consumer protection laws.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has changed its martial law policy to permit men aged 18 to 22 to travel abroad and return freely. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the move is intended to keep more young men in the country by offering them freedom of movement, insisting it will not harm Ukraine's defense capabilities. The decision has sparked debate, with some supporting it as a positive step for youth and others deeming it unfair to older men subject to mobilization. The new rule provides young Ukrainians with opportunities for short-term work, study, or travel amid the ongoing war.</p>
