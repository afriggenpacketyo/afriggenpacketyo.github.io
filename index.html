          <p>A SpaceX capsule carrying the four astronauts of NASA's Crew-10 mission has successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding a nearly five-month stay on the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two NASA astronauts, one JAXA astronaut, and a Roscosmos cosmonaut, conducted over 200 science experiments aimed at preparing for future deep-space exploration. This mission was the 12th crewed flight by SpaceX for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which continues to provide U.S. access to the station. Their replacements, the Crew-11 mission, had already arrived at the ISS a week prior.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea dismantling some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the inter-Korean border, signaling a potential de-escalation of tensions. This action follows South Korea's own removal of speakers earlier in the week, a move initiated by the new liberal government in Seoul to improve relations. The two nations had been engaged in a Cold War-style psychological warfare campaign, with the South broadcasting K-pop and news and the North responding with disruptive sounds. This recent thaw comes after a period of heightened animosity under South Korea's previous conservative administration.</p>

          <p>Roland Mehrez Beainy, a co-owner of the "Trump Burger" restaurant chain, is facing deportation after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) alleged he is in the country illegally. Federal officials claim the Lebanese national overstayed his visitor visa and engaged in fraudulent marriages to secure his status. ICE stated that enforcement actions apply regardless of an individual's political beliefs, highlighting the case amid the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown. Beainy, who has denied the allegations, is also involved in separate business disputes related to his restaurant brand.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any peace deal that involves ceding territory, stating that Ukrainians will not give their land to occupiers. His comments came after U.S. President Trump announced a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump suggested a deal could involve "some swapping of territories." Zelenskyy emphasized that any decisions made without Ukraine's direct involvement would be considered "dead solutions" and counterproductive to achieving a just and lasting peace, underscoring Kyiv's anxiety about being marginalized in negotiations.</p>

          <p>In a significant strategic shift, the Democratic party is embracing more combative tactics to fight what they describe as authoritarian moves by Republicans, particularly concerning gerrymandering. Spurred by President Trump's push to redraw congressional maps in states like Texas to favor the GOP, Democratic governors and legislators are threatening retaliatory redistricting in their own states. Figures like former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a proponent of independent commissions, now argue that Democrats must "take up arms" to counter the threat to democracy. This new, pugnacious approach signals a departure from the party's previous, more restrained political mottoes.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, has been redeveloped into a luxury apartment building called The Hartby at a cost of over $104 million. The former site of St. John's College, which had been deteriorating for decades, was converted into a 205-unit complex featuring studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments. Developers preserved original architectural elements like exposed brick and arched windows while adding modern amenities. A portion of the units are designated for affordable housing, and the project has been embraced by the local community for revitalizing the historic landmark.</p>

          <p>Several German cities have offered to take in and treat seriously ill or traumatized children from Gaza, but the initiative has stalled due to the federal government's reluctance. The Interior and Foreign Ministries have cited security concerns and stated their focus remains on providing aid locally within the region. This hesitation has drawn criticism, with some conservative politicians suggesting the cities' offers are politically motivated ahead of local elections. The debate highlights Germany's internal conflict over humanitarian intervention versus fears of encouraging a new wave of immigration, contrasting with other European nations that have already evacuated children.</p>

Bengen argues that many retirees are overly conservative and could be spending more to enjoy their retirement, suggesting that with proper strategy, a rate around 5.25% to 5.5% could be appropriate for current retirees, a significant increase from his original guideline.

This view is supported by institutions like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and Lloyd's of London.

          <p>Challenging the conventional notion that a "beach read" must be a light and frivolous book, this article from The Atlantic's newsletter suggests that a vacation read can be anything a reader desires. The piece argues that a break can be the perfect time to either escape with something fun or finally tackle a more dense and complex work. To help readers decide, the article curates several lists of recommended books for the summer. The recommendations are categorized to help people find books to redirect their attention, get lost in, or navigate new phases of life.</p>

          <h2>American Shopping Malls See Revival by Replacing Anchor Stores with Unconventional Tenants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 08:30:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are finding new life by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, bowling alleys, and large bookstores. The Dayton Mall in Ohio, for example, sold its former Sears space to a local church, which has drawn thousands of new visitors who then patronize other mall businesses. Industry experts note this trend of subdividing large retail spaces for niche and experiential businesses is boosting foot traffic and creating a "cross-shopping" effect. This diversification is helping enclosed malls, once thought to be dying, to rebound and reposition themselves as community hubs.</p>

          <p>A preseason NFL game between the Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons was suspended early after Lions safety Morice Norris sustained a serious injury while making a tackle. Medical staff attended to Norris on the field for approximately 20 minutes before he was taken to a hospital in an ambulance. The Lions later reported that he was in stable condition with feeling and movement in all his extremities. Following the lengthy delay, the coaches of both teams mutually agreed to end the game, a decision praised as a class act and the right thing to do.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to roll back protections and expand oil and gas drilling in the 23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska has drawn over a quarter of a million public comments in opposition. Critics, including conservation groups and Alaska Native communities, fear the plan will devastate Arctic wildlife, undermine subsistence rights, and accelerate climate change in one of the world's fastest-warming regions. The move is seen as an "erasure of years of work" to protect ecologically sensitive areas like Teshekpuk Lake, prioritizing industrialization over environmental and community health.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising concert ticket prices, a significant number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are using buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to afford live events. A LendingTree survey found 23% of adults have used BNPL for concert costs, with the figure rising to 37% for Gen Z. While BNPL offers interest-free installments, credit analyst Matt Schulz advises a more fiscally sound approach. He suggests that if concerts are a priority, consumers should budget for them specifically by creating a dedicated savings fund, which he dubs a "Beyoncé fund" or "Taylor Swift fund."

          <p>After a concussion from football, a New Jersey teenager named Logan Coleridge experienced months of debilitating headaches, dizziness, and memory problems that therapies could not resolve. When a specialist finally ordered an MRI, doctors discovered the true cause was not the concussion but a rare, underlying condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain. Logan underwent successful surgery to remove the AVM and has since recovered, with his family now advocating for more thorough testing after head injuries. His life has returned to normal, and he is preparing to return to football.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing tons of gold as a byproduct of generating nuclear fusion energy. The theory suggests that neutrons produced during the fusion process could be used to transmute other elements, like mercury, into gold. This would create a valuable revenue stream to help offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion power. While the idea is scientifically plausible and has intrigued physicists, it remains speculative, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist, making this a long-term and ambitious vision.</p>

          <p>Despite California enacting a landmark heat safety law 20 years ago, farmworkers continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses, an issue advocates attribute to a lack of enforcement. A recent state audit criticized Cal/OSHA for failing to take proper action and being understaffed. Many farmworkers, a large number of whom are undocumented, are hesitant to complain about unsafe conditions for fear of retaliation. As temperatures rise due to climate change, advocates and some lawmakers argue that the system intended to protect these essential workers is failing, putting them at greater risk than ever.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece remembers the life and work of Sandra Grimes, the CIA analyst who died at age 79 and was instrumental in unmasking notorious Soviet spy Aldrich Ames. In 1991, Grimes agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing, discovering they were being executed. Through meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs, she connected Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, to large cash deposits made after meetings with a Soviet official. Her crucial work led to Ames's 1994 arrest, stopping a spy who caused immense damage to U.S. national security.</p>
