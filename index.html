          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than a quarter-million 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential side curtain airbag issue. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted that improperly sealed seams could prevent the airbags from holding enough pressure during deployment in certain crashes, increasing injury risk. While the company is unaware of any related accidents or injuries, it is urging owners to comply with the recall notices. Dealers will inspect and replace the faulty airbags free of charge to ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>India's Smriti Mandhana delivered a masterful performance, scoring her first T20 international hundred with 112 runs from 62 balls. Her stunning century powered India to a total of 210-5, their second-highest in the format, setting the stage for a commanding 97-run victory over England at Trent Bridge. England's chase faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with debutante spinner Shree Charani taking four wickets.

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in Budapest's 30th annual Pride march, defying a government ban and risking significant fines. The event was a direct challenge to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's administration, which recently passed a law outlawing events that "promote" homosexuality to minors. Despite the threat of police intervention, the march proceeded with the support of Budapest's mayor and was seen as a major demonstration for LGBTQ+ rights and broader democratic freedoms in Hungary. The massive turnout is considered a significant rebuke to Orbán's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, has labeled the expanded 32-team Club World Cup as "the worst idea ever implemented in football." He expressed serious fears over player welfare, highlighting the lack of adequate recovery time due to an increasingly congested fixture calendar. Klopp warned that the relentless schedule could lead to unprecedented injuries and diminish the quality of the sport. His comments echo concerns from the global players' union, Fifpro, which has also advocated for mandatory off-season breaks for players.</p>

          <p>An employee at a St. George, Utah, auto center foiled a sophisticated auto theft scheme by noticing a "suspicious" Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on a pickup truck. The dealership was about to pay $51,000 for the 2023 Chevrolet truck when the employee discovered the VIN had been altered. The real VIN revealed the vehicle was stolen, prompting the dealer to contact law enforcement, who set up a sting operation. The arrest of three suspects also uncovered a second stolen truck they had sold to another dealer for $44,000, preventing a total loss of $95,000.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has signaled that the United States will halt its funding pledge to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. In a recorded address to a Gavi summit, Kennedy accused the organization of ignoring vaccine safety science and suppressing dissenting views, confirming the Trump administration's anti-vaccine stance is now guiding foreign policy. Gavi, which uses its purchasing power to provide low-cost vaccines to developing nations, estimates it has saved 19 million lives. Critics warn that the U.S. withdrawing its $1.2 billion pledge could result in over a million preventable child deaths.</p>

          <p>Germany is preparing to establish a commission to investigate its government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review comes as former Health Minister Jens Spahn faces criticism for procuring overpriced face masks, a decision that could cost the government billions in lawsuits. Lawmakers and scientists support the inquiry, hoping to rebuild public trust and learn lessons for future crises. The commission will likely examine the scientific advice process, coordination between federal and state governments, and the societal impact of measures like lockdowns, aiming to address lingering divisions and support those still affected by the pandemic.</p>

The incident occurred when the 5-year-old beagle, Freddie, alerted his handler to the man's suitcase during a baggage inspection. The man, who was attempting to smuggle over 100 pounds of prohibited agricultural products, kicked the 25-pound dog hard enough to lift it off the ground, causing contusions. He was ordered to pay the dog's veterinary bills and was subsequently removed back to Egypt.</p>

The letter asks publishers to pledge they will not release books created by machines, use AI tools to replace employees, or use AI narration for audiobooks. The authors argue that while AI is a powerful tool, it should not replace human art and artists, citing concerns over copyright, job displacement, and the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated content.

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone operation, dubbed "Spider Web," has fundamentally challenged traditional military strategy by demonstrating the vulnerability of airbases located deep behind front lines. The strike, which used numerous smuggled drones, reportedly destroyed or damaged over 40 of Russia's strategic bombers and other key aircraft, representing a significant blow to its long-range capabilities. This tactic of using cheap, low-flying drones launched from close proximity imposes massive costs on a larger adversary, forcing them to divert resources to base defense. The operation serves as a blueprint for how smaller militaries can effectively counter a superior air power's deep-rear assets.</p>

Starmer positioned Labour as the party protecting workers' rights and national security, contrasting it with Reform UK, which he accused of being divisive.
