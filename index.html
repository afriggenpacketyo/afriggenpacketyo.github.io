        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The war in Ukraine appears to be weakening Russia's geopolitical influence in former Soviet states, exemplified by a recent US-mediated peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia. This shift is further evidenced by tense Russia-Azerbaijan relations following a plane crash and Azerbaijan's strengthening ties with Turkey and Central Asian nations. Analysts suggest that Russia's preoccupation with Ukraine has created a "window of opportunity" for these countries to pursue more independent, multi-vector foreign policies, with China also increasing its regional influence. The article notes this change may accelerate as a new generation of post-Soviet leaders emerges.</p>

          <p>A tour bus traveling from Niagara Falls to New York City lost control and rolled over on the New York State Thruway, resulting in the deaths of five passengers. The accident, which involved a bus carrying 54 people, occurred near Pembroke and did not involve any other vehicles. While the cause is still under investigation, authorities have ruled out mechanical failure and operator impairment. Numerous other passengers were transported to local hospitals with injuries ranging from stable to critical condition, prompting a major emergency response and road closures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will not defend a federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), aligning with a lawsuit that claims the program is unconstitutional. The Justice Department argues the funding, which requires colleges to have at least 25% Hispanic undergraduate enrollment, provides an unfair advantage based on ethnicity, citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities has moved to intervene and defend the program, arguing it helps level the playing field for institutions that serve a majority of the nation's Latino undergraduates but often receive less funding.</p>

Caldwell, whose brother was killed in a Chicago shooting in 2022, is focusing his platform on law and order, a message he believes will resonate with voters concerned about rising crime. He expressed support for President Trump's initiative to deploy federal agents and the National Guard to high-crime cities like Chicago, arguing that residents are desperate for effective solutions to the ongoing violence. His potential candidacy introduces a strong focus on crime into the upcoming Senate race.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is expected to experience a brief heatwave, with temperatures potentially reaching 30°C on the upcoming bank holiday Monday. This warm spell comes amidst one of the hottest summers on record, which has previously caused wildfires and led to hosepipe bans and concerns over a poor harvest. The pleasant weather is forecast to be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are predicted to bring cooler temperatures, wind, and rain starting from Tuesday.

          <p>An Air Canada flight en route from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport due to a disruptive passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed that the crew of Flight 1705 reported a passenger disturbance, leading to the diversion. The incident was resolved upon landing in Chicago, and no arrest was made. The flight subsequently continued to its destination, arriving in Las Vegas approximately three hours behind schedule. This event is one of over 1,000 unruly passenger incidents reported by airlines so far this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a stop to the construction of the Revolution Wind project, an offshore wind farm near Rhode Island that is already approximately 80% complete. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited unspecified national security concerns for the halt, a move that aligns with the administration's broader opposition to renewable energy. The project, a joint effort by Danish developer Orsted and Global Infrastructure Partners, was expected to power over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. State governors and environmental groups have strongly criticized the decision, calling it an arbitrary setback for clean energy goals and the regional economy.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed Lt. Gen. Jeffery Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), along with two other senior military commanders.

The Pentagon has not provided an official reason for the dismissals.

The collapse of a fjord wall sent a wave of water an estimated 1,400 feet up the opposite slope, narrowly missing tour boats and cruise ships. Scientists are investigating the increasing frequency of such events, suggesting that retreating glaciers due to climate change may be destabilizing mountainsides by removing supportive ice and thawing high-elevation permafrost.

If the retiree begins collecting Social Security benefits while working, their earnings could temporarily reduce their payments, though benefits are recalculated at full retirement age. Alternatively, delaying Social Security claims while earning consulting fees could increase future monthly benefits. The short-term work could also allow for additional contributions to retirement accounts and extended access to employer-provided health insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has significantly expanded a previous ruling, now blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement. The order from U.S. District Judge William Orrick now protects major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago from losing funding. This legal setback for the administration comes amid an escalating confrontation with Democrat-led jurisdictions, including recent threats from the Attorney General and the deployment of the National Guard to cities like Washington D.C. and Los Angeles under a law-and-order mandate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to carry their service-issued weapons, escalating the Trump administration's ongoing crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses a previous stance that the approximately 2,000 troops would be unarmed. The deployment, which has been met with significant opposition from local residents and officials, is part of a broader federal intervention that President Trump has declared a success and may expand to other cities like Chicago. The move raises questions about the evolving mission and role of the troops in the city.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been denied parole after decades in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents. Parole commissioners highlighted significant concerns beyond the original crime, focusing on the brothers' behavior while incarcerated. Both were cited for using illicit cell phones, which commissioners viewed as a serious breach of rules. Erik Menendez's case was further complicated by his association with a prison gang and other infractions. The parole board also remained troubled by the killing of their mother, Kitty Menendez, and expressed that the brothers had not fully come to terms with the gravity of their actions.</p>

Speaking from prison, Maxwell also claimed that the rumored Epstein "client list" does not exist and called allegations of Prince Andrew's sexual activity with a minor in her home "mind-blowingly not conceivable." She further alleged that a widely circulated photo of Prince Andrew with his accuser is fake. The interview was conducted shortly before Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, was moved to a new facility.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted for the 31st time since December, sending fountains of lava 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption is contained and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular display for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma accumulating in a lower chamber is periodically forced to the surface through narrow vents, creating the dramatic lava fountains. While the current pattern of episodic eruptions could continue, experts note it could also evolve into a more continuous lava flow, similar to past long-term eruptions.</p>

The legislation, which redraws the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, was approved after a heated debate and a weeks-long standoff in the House, where Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. The mid-decade redistricting effort was encouraged by President Trump to bolster Republican chances in the 2026 midterm elections.
