          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in one death and several injuries, prompting investigations by the FBI and ATF. Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills described the explosion as an intentional act of violence, noting significant damage to nearby buildings. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, confirmed the incident occurred in the parking lot, but assured that their lab and reproductive materials remained secure and undamaged. California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that the state is working with local and federal authorities, and urged people to avoid the area as the investigation continues, which aims to determine whether the incident was terrorism or an act of anti-abortion violence.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. Starmer emphasized that the scheme would be reciprocal and would not represent a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the proposal as "free movement through the back door," while Reform UK echoed these sentiments, expressing concern that it could be the beginning of unrestricted EU migration. An agreement in principle is expected at an upcoming summit, but details regarding age eligibility and potential caps on numbers remain unspecified.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Walmart after the retailer warned it would need to raise prices due to tariffs, urging the company to absorb the costs rather than pass them on to consumers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey stated that the company is trying to keep prices low despite facing significant cost increases due to tariffs. Walmart affirmed its commitment to maintaining low prices, but acknowledged the challenges posed by small retail margins. Other companies, including Microsoft, Mattel, and Ford, have also announced or warned of price increases due to tariffs, highlighting the widespread impact of trade policies on businesses and consumers.</p>

The predator was about the length of an index finger, with three eyes dotting its head and a circular mouth lined with teeth.

The calls aim to end the violent conflict in Ukraine, which Trump described as a ‚Äúbloodbath‚Äù. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reported speaking with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, emphasizing the need to end the conflict and highlighting the prisoner of war exchange agreement reached in Istanbul. However, Ukraine condemned a Russian drone strike that killed civilians, underscoring the challenges in achieving a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland's struggles at Wembley Stadium persisted as Manchester City lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace. During the match, Haaland passed up the opportunity to take a penalty, handing the ball to Omar Marmoush, who subsequently missed the spot-kick. City manager Pep Guardiola explained that the decision was based on the players' feelings in the moment. Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested that the pressure of the occasion might have affected Haaland, contrasting his behavior with that of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who would not have relinquished the penalty opportunity.</p>

Zelenskyy stated that he sent the Ukrainian delegation primarily out of respect for US President Donald Trump and Erdogan. Ivan Us, a foreign policy expert, accused the Russian delegation of propaganda, stating that the US wanted to see the negotiations take place.</p>

The Spaniard's showing was his team's best of what has so far been a difficult year and it comes as a result of a major upgrade on the car that has - at least partly - been influenced by their new managing technical partner, Adrian Newey, the design legend who joined in March. However, the 43-year-old emphasised that while he was "happy to be fifth", it was not close to his or the team's ambitions.
