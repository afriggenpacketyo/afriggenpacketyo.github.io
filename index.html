          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 mRNA vaccine projects. The canceled projects, primarily targeting COVID-19 and influenza, included proposals from major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and a previously halted bird flu vaccine contract with Moderna. Kennedy stated that the administration determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a claim strongly contested by leading infectious disease experts who argue the decision undermines pandemic preparedness and ignores the proven life-saving efficacy of mRNA vaccines. The redirected funds will reportedly support what the department calls "safer, broader vaccine platforms."</p>

The meeting at the vice president's residence will reportedly include Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and FBI Director Kash Patel. This session comes amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to provide transparency regarding Maxwell's nine-hour interview, during which sources claim she made no statements harmful to President Trump.

          <p>Firefighters in Ashcroft, British Columbia, have identified an unusual cause for a recent wildfire: a fish dropped by a bird. Investigators believe an osprey caught a fish from a nearby river and subsequently dropped it onto a power line, creating sparks that ignited the dry grass below. The department humorously speculated that the bird was either tired from the heat or perhaps wanted to try a cooked meal. While the fire required approximately 4,800 gallons of water to extinguish, the fire department confirmed that the fish was thoroughly cooked but the osprey was not injured in the incident.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In northern Nigeria, villagers are increasingly making desperate peace agreements with armed bandit groups to survive, as state security efforts have failed to protect them. These communities, particularly in states like Zamfara and Sokoto, have suffered from widespread killings, abductions, and the disruption of farming, leading to severe food shortages. While some residents see these deals as a necessary evil for survival, others find it unacceptable to make peace with groups that have murdered their families. Analysts describe this trend as a "failure of the social contract," where non-state actors gain legitimacy and create a form of parallel governance, posing a long-term threat to national security.</p>

          <p>Roy Barclay, a 56-year-old fugitive, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 25 years for the murder of Anita Rose, a 57-year-old mother. Barclay, who had been on the run from police for two years, brutally attacked Rose while she was walking her dog in Brantham, Suffolk, in July of last year. The court heard that at the time of the murder, Barclay was wanted for breaching his parole conditions from a previous sentence for a violent assault. The judge described Barclay as an "unpredictable, dangerous" man, and the victim's family shared statements detailing their immeasurable loss.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a 2.5% rise in U.S. same-store sales after two quarters of decline. The rebound was attributed to successful promotions like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in and the return of Snack Wraps, which helped the company outperform rivals in both sales and traffic. Despite the positive results, CEO Chris Kempczinski expressed ongoing concern about the economic health of low-income consumers, noting that their visits have declined by double digits. The company is exploring new affordability initiatives to re-engage this crucial customer base, signaling caution about near-term consumer stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The analysis suggests these moves, influenced by tech executives, have ceded critical leverage to China and placed vital U.S. assets at geopolitical risk.

          <p>A downbeat economic analysis from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) suggests the UK is facing a budget gap of £40-50 billion, significantly larger than previous estimates. This puts pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider substantial tax rises or spending cuts in the upcoming autumn budget. With most spending fixed and political challenges around welfare cuts, the main lever left may be tax increases, potentially through changes to VAT, pension allowances, or extending the freeze on income tax thresholds.
