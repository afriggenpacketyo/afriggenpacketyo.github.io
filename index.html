          <p>Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, a founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, has pleaded guilty to drug smuggling and conspiracy charges in New York, concluding one of organized crime's most enduring careers. The 77-year-old expressed remorse for the harm caused by illegal drugs in the U.S. and Mexico, admitting the cartel fueled corruption by paying officials. This plea follows his arrest in Texas after being reportedly ambushed by 'Los Chapitos', sons of his former ally 'El Chapo' Guzmán. Zambada is expected to receive a more lenient sentence, likely spending the rest of his life in a U.S. federal prison.</p>

This incident is among the deadliest targeting hospitals and journalists in the 22-month conflict, occurring as Israel plans to expand its offensive. Israeli officials expressed regret for the "tragic mishap" and stated an inquiry would be conducted, emphasizing their war is against Hamas, not civilians or journalists.

          <p>Google's YouTube TV announced that Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News, and Fox Sports channels might be removed from its platform if a new agreement with Fox Corporation isn't reached by Wednesday. YouTube claims Fox is demanding significantly higher payments than comparable content partners, aiming for a fair deal without passing excessive costs to subscribers. Fox, however, accuses Google of exploiting its influence with unreasonable terms. If a blackout occurs, YouTube will offer subscribers a $10 credit, with Fox content still available via Fox One streaming.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard offloaded over 38 tons of cocaine and marijuana at Port Everglades, Florida, marking the largest cocaine seizure in its history. The 76,140 pounds of narcotics, valued at $473 million, were intercepted during 19 interdictions in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Rear Admiral Adam Chamie highlighted the immense scale of the threat, stating the cocaine alone represented 23 million lethal doses, enough to fatally overdose Florida's entire population. Officials emphasized that maritime interdictions are crucial for preventing these deadly drugs from reaching communities and destroying lives.</p>

          <p>A child sexual assault victim, identified as "Zora," is pleading with Elon Musk to prevent links to images of her abuse from being shared on X (formerly Twitter). Zora, who was first abused over two decades ago, expressed outrage that material depicting her and others' abuse continues to be circulated and commodified. The BBC investigation found such material being offered for sale on X, leading to a trader in Indonesia. X claims a "zero tolerance" policy for child sexual abuse material, but critics argue social media platforms need to do more to prevent repeat offenders from re-emerging.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders targeting cashless bail policies and flag desecration, signaling a federal crackdown on crime. The order on cashless bail threatens to withhold federal funding from jurisdictions, starting with Washington D.C., that maintain such policies, which Trump claims fueled a rise in crime. Another order directs the Justice Department to investigate flag burning, despite a 1989 Supreme Court ruling protecting it as symbolic speech, with Trump advocating for a minimum one-year prison sentence. These actions also include plans to increase federal law enforcement presence in D.C. and enhance National Guard readiness for civil disturbances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food price inflation reached 4.2% this month, the highest in 18 months, primarily driven by increasing costs of chocolate, butter, and eggs. Poor cocoa harvests due to climate change and disease contributed to the rise in chocolate prices, while high demand and increased labor costs affected butter and eggs. This uptick aligns with separate data from the Office for National Statistics, showing a 4.9% rise in food and non-alcoholic beverage costs year-on-year. Consumers are advised to reassess household budgets as overall inflation also increased to 3.8% in July.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC study reveals that UK local authorities are selling off public assets like schools and care homes to manage a spiraling £122 billion debt pile. This "fire sale" is a consequence of increased borrowing, often for commercial investments, and a significant reduction in central government funding since 2010. Many councils are now granted "capitalisation directions" to sell assets or take short-term loans for day-to-day services, further exacerbating debt. Experts warn this trend erodes "public value" and is unsustainable without long-term government solutions, as one-third of councils anticipate bankruptcy within five years.</p>

The lawsuit centers on Apple's exclusive use of ChatGPT as an AI "answer engine" on the iPhone, which Musk alleges unfairly elevates ChatGPT in app store rankings and provides OpenAI with invaluable data unavailable to competitors like Grok.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has urged accelerated drone adoption, and the U.S. has proposed a "hellscape" strategy using drone swarms around Taiwan. However, the ongoing investment in crewed systems indicates a belief that human elements are indispensable for modern warfare.</p>

          <p>A late-arriving monsoonal weather pattern has brought widespread wild weather across the Western U.S., causing significant disruptions and hazards. Burning Man attendees in Nevada faced major dust storms and traffic halts, while Yosemite National Park experienced rare August rain and minor flooding. Across California's interior mountains, thunderstorms sparked over 10,000 lightning strikes, leading to several forest fires, including the 4,500-acre Garnet fire. Additionally, airports like LAX experienced ground stops due to the severe weather, which is unusual for its late arrival in the season.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is bringing back its popular Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) and other fall-inspired items on Tuesday, August 26, marking an increasingly early arrival for the seasonal menu. The PSL, introduced over 20 years ago, remains the most popular seasonal beverage, having sold hundreds of millions. This early launch, including new items like Pecan Cold Foam, aims to boost sales for the coffee giant, which has recently seen a 2% decline in U.S. sales and weakening in-store traffic. CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence that the fall program, especially the PSL, will attract many customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's potential second term is characterized by a significant expansion of federal power, described as "right-wing socialism," a departure from traditional Republican small-government ideology. This includes bullying state governments, influencing private institutions, and even taking a 10% stake in Intel, a move that surprised many conservatives. The article highlights Trump's willingness to use federal authority to dictate policy, from elections to military deployment, and his efforts to control monetary policy and media coverage. This approach, while shrinking some federal agencies, paradoxically expands government's intrusive role, creating a less effective yet more expensive and pervasive state.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump declared that China must guarantee the supply of rare earth magnets to the United States or face a 200% tariff, a measure he conceded would likely cause a breakdown in bilateral trade. Trump asserted that the U.S. possesses "tremendous power" over China through tariffs, though he expressed a reluctance to fully utilize these "incredible cards" as it would "destroy China." He also confirmed that Chinese students would continue to be allowed into the country. This statement highlights ongoing trade tensions and the strategic importance of rare earth materials.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again publicly called for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to revoke the broadcast licenses of ABC and NBC, accusing them of extreme bias against him. This latest attack follows a social media barrage where Trump claimed 97% of their stories about him were "BAD STORIES." FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who has previously supported Trump's lawsuits against networks and initiated reviews of major broadcasters, has not commented. These actions raise concerns about press freedom and the FCC's independence, as Carr's investigations could impede business deals for the networks' parent companies, Disney and Comcast.</p>

          <p>Indian garment, diamond, and jewelry factories are facing severe economic hardship due to the U.S. President Donald Trump's impending 50% tariffs, which trade experts liken to an embargo. In Tiruppur, a major textile hub, factories are pausing orders and laying off workers as U.S. buyers shift to more competitive markets like Mexico and Vietnam. Similarly, Mumbai's jewelry sector and Surat's diamond polishing industry are nervous about plummeting sales and livelihoods. These tariffs, combined with declining global demand and competition from lab-grown diamonds, are creating a dual crisis for millions of Indian workers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's plan to deport Kilmar Ábrego García, who was detained by ICE just days after his release from criminal custody. Ábrego's lawyers filed a lawsuit challenging his potential deportation to Uganda, alleging the government used it as leverage to pressure him into a guilty plea for human smuggling charges. Judge Paula Xinis ordered that Ábrego cannot be removed from the U.S. until an evidentiary hearing, expressing concern over the alleged coercion. This development follows Ábrego's wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year, which the administration admitted was an "administrative error."</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police reported "far fewer" incidents of serious violence at this year's Notting Hill Carnival compared to recent years, with 423 arrests over two days. While there were two stabbings, neither resulted in serious injury, a notable improvement from last year's eight stabbings and two deaths. Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward attributed this reduction to proactive measures like live facial recognition (LFR), metal detectors, and stop-and-search. The use of LFR remains controversial among civil liberty groups, who argue it's a mass surveillance tool and potentially less accurate for women and people of color.</p>
