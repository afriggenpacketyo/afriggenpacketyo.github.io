          <p>Norwich City has dismissed head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup following a series of defeats, appointing former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere as his replacement for the remaining two games of the season. The club's sporting director, Ben Knapper, cited recent poor results as the reason for the change, despite having initially hired Thorup with a long-term strategy in mind. Wilshere, assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley, will oversee the team's upcoming matches against Middlesbrough and Cardiff, as Norwich sits 14th in the Championship table.

          <p>The stock market experienced a downturn as a reaction to President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Trump also intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, advocating for interest rate reductions, with Trump previously stating Powell's "termination cannot come fast enough". A recent CNBC poll revealed that a majority of American adults disapprove of Trump's tariff policy and his handling of inflation and the cost of living. The tariffs and the president's comments on the Federal Reserve continue to create economic uncertainty.</p>

Policing Minister Diana Johnson counters that the plan is unworkable and would hinder the monitoring of serious antisemitism and other racist incidents. NCHIs are defined as acts perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice but do not constitute a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating increasing tariff-free rice imports from the United States as part of ongoing trade negotiations regarding tariffs imposed by Washington.

This move is intended to secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs, amidst domestic pressure for more affordable imported rice due to rising prices and supply shortages.

          <p>A decrease in air travel to the U.S., influenced by President Donald Trump's tariffs, is negatively impacting Walt Disney's theme park business. International visitors, who constitute roughly 20% of Disney's park attendance in Orlando and Anaheim, are declining. Overall U.S. airport traffic has stagnated, reflecting concerns that tariffs could slow the global economy. Increased competition from Universal's new theme park, Epic Universe, could further erode Disney's market share. These factors are causing analysts to re-evaluate Disney's earnings potential.
