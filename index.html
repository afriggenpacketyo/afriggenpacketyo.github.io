          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba traveled to Canada for the G7 summit, preparing for discussions on trade and tariffs with U.S. President Donald Trump amidst ongoing tensions and negotiations. Ishiba emphasized the importance of G7 unity in addressing global issues, including the situation in the Indo-Pacific region and the war in Ukraine. Japan aims to avoid hasty agreements that compromise national interests, especially with upcoming elections and persistent inflation impacting the public. Ishiba also plans to engage in talks with leaders from South Korea, Ukraine, and Australia during the summit to foster broader cooperation and address shared challenges. Optimism regarding a quick resolution remains tempered given the complexities of the trade negotiations. </p>

          <p>A Palestinian resident of Gaza recounts the increasingly desperate situation faced by civilians seeking humanitarian aid, highlighting incidents of violence and chaos at distribution points. The author describes how hunger has been weaponized, with aid distribution turning into a dangerous scramble for survival amid Israeli military presence. They contrast this with the more organized and dignified aid system previously run by UNRWA, where community members distributed supplies fairly. The author emphasizes the desperation of the people, who value their dignity but are driven to extreme measures by hunger and the lack of available food and condemns the current aid system as humiliating and insufficient. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams in the Yellow River estuary, China, will become more frequent due to global warming by the end of the century, impacting coastal cities. As warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart, it drifts downstream and refreezes, forming destructive ice jams. These jams can lead to flooding and damage to downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. The study emphasizes the need to consider climate projections in managing the risks associated with ice jam floods in the lower Yellow River. </p>

Jane's testimony also revealed Diddy's alleged reaction to the release of a video showing him assaulting Cassie Ventura, and a violent altercation she allegedly experienced with Diddy in June 2024. Despite the graphic details, it remains uncertain whether the testimony will be sufficient to convince the jury that Diddy's behavior was criminal. </p>

          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be exported to England daily after a landfill ban comes into effect at the end of the year. The Scottish government's ban on biodegradable municipal waste aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but faces challenges due to insufficient incinerator capacity. This capacity gap may result in waste being transported to landfills in England, raising concerns about increased emissions from transportation. While the long-term strategy involves increasing recycling rates, domestic recycling rates have seen minimal improvement, necessitating a shift towards energy-from-waste incinerators. </p>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation reveals concerns about safety at funfairs and amusement parks in England, Scotland, and Wales, highlighting thousands of injuries over the past decade. The report focuses on the regulation of inspections and accidents linked to one inspector in particular, raising questions about industry oversight. Jade Harrison, who was seriously injured at Hull Fair in 2019, shares her experience, noting that the same ride had a fatality in Australia prior to being sold to a UK owner. The investigation underscores the need for improved safety measures and more stringent regulation to protect the public. </p>

          <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) will launch a nationwide operation to target and imprison predators involved in child sexual assault as part of grooming gangs. This initiative aims to provide justice for victims whose cases have not progressed through the criminal justice system and prevent further abuse. The operation seeks to improve how local police forces investigate such crimes and end the culture of denial within local services and authorities. This action comes ahead of a report by Baroness Louise Casey on group-based child sexual assault and follows the announcement of a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs. </p>

          <p>An analyst argues that Israel's recent actions, including the attacks on Iran, are an attempt to restore its reputation following the fallout from the Gaza conflict. The author suggests that Israel's actions are driven by a desire to regain international support and shift the narrative back to its historical role as a victim. By engaging a new enemy, Israel hopes to reset the terms of its relationship with allies and divert attention from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The author raises concerns about the potential for escalation and the lack of a clear endgame for these actions. </p>

          <p>Analysts caution that Donald Trump's proposed "revenge tax" could threaten foreign investment into the U.S. The provision, within the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would allow the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions with "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. individuals and companies. This could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe-haven status, as many European countries could fall under this category. Goldman Sachs suggests UK companies with significant U.S. revenue exposure might consider relisting in New York to avoid the tax. </p>
