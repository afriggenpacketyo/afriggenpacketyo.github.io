          <h2>Iran Denounces US Nuclear Demands as Excessive Amidst Ongoing Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the United States' demands in nuclear talks, deeming them 'outrageous' for insisting Iran halt uranium enrichment. Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi echoed this sentiment, suggesting talks would fail if the US maintains its stance. The US views enrichment as a step toward nuclear weapons development, while Iran insists its program is peaceful. These discussions, mediated by Oman, mark the highest-level contact since the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear accord, leading to sanctions and increased Iranian enrichment. Trump warned of potential negative consequences if Iran does not act quickly towards a deal.</p>

          <p>Northeastern Minnesota is grappling with three major wildfires, compounded by colossal fires in neighboring Canadian provinces. The Minnesota fires, now spanning approximately 30,000 acres, are being fought by multiple agencies.

Donations are being accepted through organizations like the Head of the Lakes United Way and the United Way Northeastern Minnesota, aiding those affected in Lake and St. Louis Counties.

          <p>The Maine Coast Fishermanâ€™s Association has voiced its support for Jordon Hudson, who advocated for Maine's commercial fishermen during the Miss Maine USA pageant. Hudson has been a champion for the fishing community, acknowledging Senator Susan Collins and the Trump administration for their work on Maine Sea Grant funding. During the pageant, Hudson expressed her desire to advocate for these communities to prevent further decline in the fishing industry, drawing from her family's history with a fishing business that went bankrupt due to regulatory constraints. The Association highlighted that advocacy can take many forms, praising Hudson for bringing attention to Maine fishing communities.</p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with Juan Soto regarding his effort running out of the batter's box, following an incident where Soto watched a potential home run bounce off the Green Monster for a single. This comes after a similar play where Soto was slow out of the box on a ground ball during a game against the Yankees. Despite signing a significant contract with the Mets, Soto's performance has been mixed, though his OPS remains second-best among qualified Mets players. Mendoza emphasized the need for Soto to hustle, especially in a ballpark like Fenway Park.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff reduction, a survey by Allianz Trade reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters plan to increase exports to markets outside the U.S. The U.S.-China 'decoupling' remains a likely scenario, with Chinese exporters seeking alternatives and American firms shifting production out of China. Many firms expect a decrease in export turnover due to U.S. tariffs, which remain significantly higher than pre-Trump administration levels. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is a popular choice for companies seeking to move production overseas, while perceptions of Vietnam are mixed due to rising costs.</p>

He will also propose a new trade framework following the potential end of the Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).

This contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, missing earnings expectations but beating sales estimates.

          <p>Shipments of smartphones made in China to the United States, including Apple's iPhone, experienced a sharp decline in April, reaching their lowest levels since 2011. This drop underscores the impact of U.S. tariffs on trade between the two countries. Smartphone exports decreased by 72% to just under US$700 million last month, significantly outpacing an overall 21% drop in Chinese shipments to the U.S. This disruption to tech supply chains is a result of the Trump administration's tariffs campaign, with levies reaching as high as 145% on Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, removing their protection from deportation and work authorization in the United States.

Lawyers representing TPS holders expressed shock at the Court's decision, calling it the largest single action stripping non-citizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history.

          <p>A Mexican naval ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members, after suddenly accelerating in the wrong direction. According to federal transportation officials, the ship was moving at six knots when its masts struck the bridge. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the cause of the sudden acceleration, with officials working with Mexican counterparts to access the ship and interview crew members. The incident occurred shortly after the ship departed from a Lower Manhattan pier, en route to Iceland.</p>

Mosura was a member of radiodonts, an extinct group including Anomalocaris canadensis.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that the ancestor of animals and plants was a hydrogen-metabolizing cell existing before the Great Oxidation Event. The study, published in Nature, suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes, characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus, are the foundation of complex life, including animals, plants, and fungi. These findings support the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes and could provide insights into the evolution of life and the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

Through the Viviendo con Felinos program, ranchers are paid for photos of wild cats taken on their land, incentivizing them to protect jaguars and their prey. This initiative has expanded the protected area for jaguars and fostered a cultural shift, with ranchers increasingly valuing the presence of these animals. The success of this program offers hope for restoring jaguars to their historic range in the US, dependent on maintaining openings in the border wall and a healthy population in Mexico.</p>
