          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States conducted strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, asserting that the facilities were "completely and totally obliterated" in what he called a "spectacular military success." B-2 bombers dropped Massive Ordnance Penetrators on the Fordow site, while Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from a U.S. Navy submarine at Natanz and Isfahan. Trump addressed the nation following the strikes, warning of further attacks if Iran does not "make peace" and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to speak from the Pentagon later in the day to provide more details about the attacks, which mark a major escalation in tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) voiced his support for President Donald Trump's decision to attack three fortified underground nuclear sites in Iran, amidst rising tensions in the Middle East. Fetterman stated on X that it was the "correct move" and emphasized that Iran, as a leading sponsor of terrorism, should not possess nuclear capabilities. Trump announced the operation as a "very successful attack" targeting key nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, and called for de-escalation following the strikes, which involved bunker buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles.</p>

The US says it hit nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan, with MOPs (Massive Ordnance Penetrators) believed to have been used due to the depth of Fordo's tunnels, and there are conflicting reports regarding the extent of the damage and potential casualties.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, describing the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites as a "spectacular military success" and warning of more attacks if Iran does not "make peace." He claimed the strikes "completely and totally obliterated" the targeted sites and reiterated that the objective was to end the nuclear threat posed by Iran. The strikes targeted facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with Trump thanking U.S. service members and the Israeli military, while Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes but stated they would not halt Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Newsmax (NMAX) executed a volatile IPO in 2025, reaching unsustainable valuations driven by its association with President Trump and meme stock dynamics. The company's net loss widened in 2024 due to payments to Smartmatic and infrastructure expansion, offsetting revenue gains from advertising, cable licensing, and subscriptions. Despite reaching 40 million people through its channels, Newsmax faces challenges, including legal battles with Dominion, potential carriage disputes with pay TV providers, and significant dilution from earlier investors selling shares, and analysts are mixed on the long-term potential of Newsmax stock.

          <p>An analysis of historical resistance to Nazism offers insights for the American left, emphasizing the importance of creating tangible change rather than focusing on spectacle or moral grandstanding. Effective resistance involves self-scrutiny, empathy, and a focus on improving the lives of others, as demonstrated by figures like Emmi Bonhoeffer and Sebastian Haffner. The author argues that the US left should be ready to embrace those who may eventually realize they have been misled by far-right leaders, working towards a better future for everyone.</p>

While there are indications of a shift in the Republican Party, skepticism remains about whether the party's DNA has truly changed and whether it can genuinely help working-class people.</p>
