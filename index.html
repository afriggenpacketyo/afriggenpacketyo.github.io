          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new $175 billion missile defense shield called "Golden Dome," led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, aiming for operational status within three years. The system, intended to intercept missiles from any location, echoes President Reagan's "Star Wars" program but relies on technological advancements. Experts note the current US system primarily targets intercontinental ballistic missiles from rogue states, needing better protection against drones, cruise missiles, and hypersonic weapons. While Republicans seem supportive, Democrats question the steep cost without a clear plan, raising concerns about potentially siphoning funds from other vital programs.</p>

          <p>An animal refuge in Culiacan, Mexico, is relocating its 700 animals, including lions and elephants, due to escalating cartel violence. A power struggle between rival Sinaloa Cartel factions has led to armed attacks, death threats, and supply shortages for the Ostok Sanctuary. The sanctuary's director stated that the animals are scared by the sounds of gunshots and helicopters, and staff members have received threats for rescuing abandoned "narco pets." The organization hopes to find safety for the animals in Mazatlan, though concerns remain about the widespread nature of cartel violence.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the complexities of prostate cancer screening, prompted by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s recent diagnosis. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70 due to the risk of false positives and unnecessary treatment, but many men continue screening in consultation with their doctors. The article highlights that even with regular screening, aggressive prostate cancers can develop undetected. Experts emphasize that the PSA test is not perfect and fast-growing cancers can arise between screenings, making early detection challenging even with access to high-quality medical care.</p>

Google also announced plans for augmented reality glasses and a subscription AI tool. Analysts suggest the chatbot will minimize the number of web pages users need to browse and enable more complex queries, potentially impacting Google's revenue model as it becomes more efficient at answering questions but less efficient at generating clicks.</p>

This decision means many healthy Americans may not have access to updated shots. The FDA's new leadership aims to balance rapid access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence for those at average or low risk.

          <p>A spokesperson for former President Joe Biden stated that his last prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test was in 2014, aligning with medical recommendations for men over 70. Current guidelines suggest men aged 55 to 69 should discuss PSA tests with their doctor, while those 70 and older generally should not receive them due to the risk of false positives. The article emphasizes that a PSA screening is not a perfect test, and medical experts debate its appropriate use. This information was released after Biden announced he had an aggressive form of prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>The FDA announced it will limit access to seasonal COVID-19 boosters for healthy Americans under 65 without clear evidence of clinical benefit. The agency will make boosters available for Americans over 65 and those with at least one condition that increases their risk of severe COVID-19.

Additionally, the MAGA accounts come with complex rules, such as restrictions on withdrawals before age 25 and automatic disbursement at 31, making them potentially less attractive for most families.
