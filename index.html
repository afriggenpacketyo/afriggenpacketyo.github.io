          <p>Miguel Uribe Turbay, a 39-year-old Colombian senator and presidential candidate, has died more than two months after being shot at a campaign rally in Bogota. He sustained critical gunshot wounds to his head and leg on June 7 and had been in intensive care since. Authorities have arrested several suspects, including the alleged mastermind, but the motive remains under investigation. The assassination has intensified concerns about political violence in Colombia, a country with a history of such attacks against political figures.</p>

          <p>Chinese aerospace engineers have unveiled a new "stealth" launcher designed to capture space debris using a net. The device operates without producing smoke, light, or significant vibration, allowing for precise targeting without disturbing the launch platform. This is achieved through a closed-gas, energy-absorbing mechanism that contains the force of the launch. While its stated purpose is for clearing orbital debris, the technology's stealth characteristics have raised concerns about its potential dual-use as a space weapon.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has ordered authorities in New Delhi to remove 5,000 stray dogs from high-risk areas within eight weeks due to a surge in dog bite incidents, reportedly reaching 2,000 per day. The dogs are to be sterilized and moved to shelters. The ruling comes as India accounts for over a third of global rabies deaths, making the issue a serious public health concern. However, animal welfare advocates have criticized the order as impractical and unscientific, questioning the availability of shelters and advocating for mass vaccination and sterilization instead.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Gaza City has killed Anas al-Sharif, a well-known Al Jazeera journalist, along with four of his colleagues. The attack occurred at a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital, killing a total of seven people. The Israel Defense Forces admitted to the strike, claiming al-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, a charge that rights advocates say lacks evidence and that he was targeted for his reporting. The incident has drawn condemnation and highlights the extreme dangers faced by journalists covering the conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals are heard, adding 15 new countries including Canada, India, and Australia to the scheme. This "deport now, appeal later" system allows the government to remove foreign nationals convicted of crimes, who can then participate in their appeal hearings via video link from their home country. The government states the measure aims to prevent criminals from exploiting the immigration system and to help ease overcrowding in prisons. The expansion brings the total number of countries in the scheme to 23.</p>

          <p>Workers in India's jewelry, textile, and auto parts industries are expressing anxiety over new US tariffs, which could total 50% on certain goods. The tariffs, a response to India's continued purchases of Russian oil, threaten a significant part of India's $87 billion export economy with the US. Diamond polishers in Surat and textile workers in Tiruppur fear job losses and reduced hours as Indian goods become more expensive for American buyers. Industry leaders warn that the steep tariffs could devastate these sectors, which are already grappling with an economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

The authors, who helped lead responses to past outbreaks like Ebola, argue that these systems were crucial for containing threats at their source.

Instead of a binary "is it AGI or not?" framework, Altman suggests it is more productive to think in terms of continuous progress and different levels of AI capability.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that consumers should carefully re-evaluate their travel credit cards as many issuers increase annual fees while reducing perks. For instance, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card increased its fee by 45% to $795, and both Capital One and American Express have tightened rules for free airport lounge access for guests. Analysts warn that these premium cards are becoming harder to maximize and are only worthwhile if the benefits are fully used. They emphasize that carrying a balance on these high-interest cards will quickly negate the value of any rewards earned. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace Football Club has lost its appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and will be demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League for the upcoming season. The demotion, which confirms Nottingham Forest's place in the Europa League, was a punishment from UEFA for breaching multi-club ownership rules. The breach was related to the stake held by American businessman John Textor, who is also the majority owner of fellow Europa League qualifier Lyon. Palace had missed a deadline to provide proof of restructuring their ownership to comply with UEFA regulations.</p>

The author, who witnessed the riots as a teenager, notes that Watts still suffers from high rates of poverty and unemployment, and a lack of essential services. While civil rights advancements have allowed many Black individuals to achieve success, a generation remains in underserved communities like Watts. The piece concludes that while some advocacy groups are making efforts, too little has changed.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen issues were glaringly exposed in a recent 5-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, where they surrendered three home runs in the final two innings. The loss has intensified criticism of the team's front office for not acquiring a standout relief pitcher at the trade deadline. The team is currently relying on a patchwork of recovering and inconsistent pitchers for high-leverage situations. While the offense has been potent, the bullpen's inability to secure leads is becoming a major concern for the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>Media mogul Byron Allen is re-entering late-night television as the genre faces significant economic pressures, highlighted by CBS's decision to end "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." Allen's show, "Comics Unleashed," will take over the 12:30 a.m. slot with a low-cost production model where his company buys the airtime and sells most of the ads. This approach is attractive to networks as they cut costs on expensive traditional talk shows, which are seeing declining viewership and ad revenue.

The center aims to streamline the work of various government agencies and nonprofits that were previously acting independently, leading to service gaps and overlaps. By centralizing requests for encampment cleanups, healthcare, and housing, the ECRC can better manage the deployment of over 150 outreach teams and connect individuals with available resources more quickly. The initiative is part of a broader effort to reform the county's approach to its growing homelessness crisis.</p>

The federal actions are based on allegations of antisemitism, illegal use of race in admissions, and policies on transgender athletes. Newsom called the move "extortion" and an attack on academic freedom. The escalating conflict brings the national battle over higher education to the country's largest public university system, with a UC Regents emergency meeting and a federal court hearing scheduled this week.</p>
