        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 12% revenue increase in the third quarter of 2025, ending two consecutive periods of decline. Despite this growth, the company's earnings per share fell short of analyst expectations, leading to a 2% drop in its stock during extended trading. The profit decrease was attributed to lower electric vehicle prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly due to investments in AI and other R&D projects. Additionally, the expiration of federal EV tax credits influenced sales, pulling them forward into the quarter, and the article notes ongoing sales struggles in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fifth episode of Celebrity Traitors saw the faithfuls, including David Olusoga and Kate Garraway, express frustration over their inability to identify the traitors, following another murder. Presenter Claudia Winkleman admonished the celebrities for losing seven faithfuls. Cracks began to show within the traitor trio—Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, and Cat Burns—with Burns turning on Ross, who also drew suspicion from other contestants and social media. The episode concluded with a tie at the roundtable, leaving the outcome uncertain until the next broadcast.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military conducted its eighth strike on an alleged drug vessel since September 2, this time in international waters off Colombia, resulting in two fatalities. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the strike was directed by President Trump, targeting a vessel operated by a designated terrorist organization involved in narco-trafficking. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly raised concerns about the legal and constitutional rationale for these strikes, noting that fentanyl, a primary concern, is typically transported differently. At least 34 people have died in these U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats, with the administration asserting a "non-international armed conflict" with cartels.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees from its artificial intelligence unit as part of an effort to reduce redundancy and enhance agility. These cuts, announced by Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, impact various AI infrastructure and product-related roles, but spare top-tier hires in TBD Labs, signaling CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategic focus on new talent. The AI unit was reportedly "bloated," with teams competing for resources, prompting this restructuring to solidify Wang's leadership and accelerate Meta's AI ambitions against rivals. The company is investing billions in AI infrastructure and recruitment, despite anticipating increased expenses for 2026.</p>

          <p>Jim Gamble, a prominent child abuse expert and former head of CEOP, has withdrawn from the UK's grooming gang inquiry, citing a "highly charged and toxic environment" due to political "point-scoring."

However, two other survivors have chosen to remain on the panel, advocating for a broader scope that includes other forms of sexual abuse. The controversy highlights deep divisions over the inquiry's leadership and focus, raising concerns about its effectiveness for victims.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized U.S. cattle ranchers, stating they "don't understand" the benefits of his tariffs, after they opposed his plan to import Argentine beef to lower consumer prices. Trump asserted that his 50% tariff on Brazilian beef imports was the sole reason for their recent success, urging them to reduce their prices for consumers. This proposal has drawn swift rebukes from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and Republican senators, who warn that government intervention and Argentine imports would harm American producers. The financial relationship with Argentina has also faced scrutiny following a $20 billion currency swap deal.</p>

For investors, this downturn is presented as a potential opportunity to adjust or add to positions through dollar-cost averaging, emphasizing the importance of diversification with physical gold or ETFs.

          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to jump 40% to $1.32 per pound this Thanksgiving, a significant increase from the previous year. This surge is primarily attributed to a reduction in turkey supply, stemming from slightly weakened demand and severe avian flu outbreaks that have impacted over 3 million turkeys this year. Despite the wholesale price hike, retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering competitive deals, aiming to attract budget-conscious consumers with meal packages under $4 per person. Experts anticipate that while consumer prices may see some increase, it will likely be less drastic than the wholesale surge due to retailers using turkeys as "loss leaders."</p>

          <p>A study by Oxford Economics predicts that many Americans will receive larger tax refunds next year when filing their 2025 tax returns, potentially totaling an additional $50 billion in taxpayer savings. This "windfall" is attributed to new retroactive provisions within the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act, signed by President Trump in July, which extended tax reductions and introduced new breaks like eliminating taxes on some overtime income. The IRS has not yet updated withholding tables, meaning many taxpayers will have overpaid throughout the year. The analysis notes that a disproportionate share of these benefits will accrue to higher-income households. (not investment advice)</p>
