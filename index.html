        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As conflict escalated between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration grew concerned about the potential for nuclear war, according to this New York Times article. Vice President JD Vance initially downplayed the conflict, but the administration quickly intervened after Pakistani and Indian air forces engaged in dogfights and explosions hit a key Pakistani air base near Islamabad. Vance contacted Prime Minister Modi, while Marco Rubio spoke with General Munir of the Pakistani army, urging de-escalation. President Trump announced a cease-fire, with Pakistan acknowledging US involvement while India remained silent. The intervention was credited with pulling the two sides back from the brink of war.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin called for direct talks with Ukraine to begin as early as May 15 in Istanbul, aiming to remove the root causes of the conflict and move towards a lasting peace. This announcement came hours after European leaders, including the UK Prime Minister and French President, visited Ukraine, urging Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and threatening new sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not comply. Kyiv has not yet responded to the invitation, and the Kremlin has warned that trying to pressure Russia is useless. Putin stated that the talks could result in new ceasefires and truces.</p>

          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona spoke at a town hall in Pennsylvania, advocating for the Democratic party to embrace a more inclusive approach and avoid alienating potential supporters.

Gallego emphasized the importance of empathizing with voters' concerns about the economy and communicating a message of support.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan voiced concerns about cutting the consumption tax as a measure to alleviate inflation, citing potential strain on state finances. While opposition parties support a consumption tax cut before the upcoming election, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative support methods for those in need. He also stated that Japan would continue to seek the complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports during tariff negotiations with the United States. The Prime Minister clarified that Japan would not sacrifice agricultural products for cars in trade negotiations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>An 89-year-old Florida man and his dog were killed by a black bear in Jerome, marking the first fatal black bear attack in Florida's recorded history.

Three adult male bears were killed in response, and necropsy results confirmed that one bear had consumed partial remains of the victim. The incident occurred in an area with a significant bear population, and while bear attacks are rare in Florida, officials emphasize caution, especially when cubs, food, or dogs are present.</p>

          <p>A Maryland oral surgeon, Dr. James Ryan, was convicted of depraved-heart murder in the overdose death of his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, after Rachel Harris found text messages on Sarah's laptop. The prosecution argued that Ryan, who had a history of providing Sarah with dangerous anesthetics like ketamine and propofol, recklessly disregarded her life. Despite the defense's argument that Sarah was struggling with mental illness and may have overdosed intentionally, the jury found Ryan guilty, sentencing him to 45 years in prison. This article provides an overview of the investigation, trial, and emotional impact on Sarah's family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global uncertainties increase, China is diversifying its food import sources, with Southeast Asian nations becoming more viable suppliers due to overseas investments and cooperative farming. Yunnan, a Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a key role in this regional agricultural cooperation. Yunnan's involvement dates back decades to an "alternative crop cultivation programme" aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology and promoting sustainable economic alternatives. With China's growing demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, this overseas cooperation is an effective way to support the country's food security.</p>

Wood emphasizes that her services are fully clothed, platonic, and nurturing, with strict boundaries and consent protocols. While some experts stress the importance of familiarity for touch to be beneficial, Wood's clients report feeling stress relief, relaxation, and a deeper sense of connection through her sessions.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the US-Canada border are experiencing economic strain due to the trade war and tariffs imposed by President Trump, leading to a decline in cross-border travel and trade. Border crossings between the US and Canada have decreased significantly, affecting local businesses that rely on Canadian customers. Duty-free shops have seen substantial sales declines, and residents are increasingly choosing to "Buy Canadian" in response to the strained relationship. These towns are facing a second economic hit, following the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Experts discuss the key elements for winning the Eurovision Song Contest, emphasizing the importance of a soulful ballad or a cheesy extravaganza with eye-popping staging. Bennett suggests that successful songs often fall under themes of love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history, or music-making. Thomas Stengaard highlights the value of simple and effective staging, while Carrie Grant notes that minor-key songs are increasingly dominant, though Remember Monday is attempting to buck that trend with a major-key song. A surprise twist, like a costume change, can also help a song stick in the mind.</p>
