          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. According to a joint statement, both countries will suspend their respective tariffs for 90 days while they negotiate. The United States will reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from its current 145 percent, while China will lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. Global markets responded positively to the news, with stock futures and benchmark indexes in Hong Kong and Europe surging. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that both sides have a shared interest in balanced trade and neither side wanted a decoupling.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. This decision follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the organization to disarm and dissolve itself. The move could reshape Turkish politics and potentially influence other Kurdish militias in neighboring countries, particularly in Syria. President Erdogan may benefit from the PKK’s dissolution, potentially expanding his support among Kurds and strengthening his position for future elections, according to analysts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Royal experts suggest that Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal stems from learning from Princess Diana's experiences, particularly by avoiding rushing into royal life and maintaining a focus on duty. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age and faced intense media scrutiny, Kate was more mature and had a longer courtship with Prince William. According to author Edward White, Kate's approach is more reminiscent of older generations of royal figures, emphasizing duty and avoiding unnecessary attention. With a supportive family and spouse, Kate has navigated royal life with ease, contrasting Diana's struggles with royal bureaucracy and press intrusion.</p>

          <p>Opening statements are expected to begin in the trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, where he faces racketeering and sex trafficking charges. The formal jury selection is expected to be completed on Monday, May 12, 2025. Combs' lawyers plan to argue that while he may have committed domestic violence in his relationships, his behavior did not amount to coercion. Witnesses may also begin taking the stand as the trial progresses, though the proceedings are not televised. Combs faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted, with the possibility of life imprisonment.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Warn of the Dangers of Sugar Addiction and Overconsumption</h2>

          <p>Health experts are warning about the dangers of sugar addiction and overconsumption, citing its links to various health problems including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. While it's debated whether sugar is truly addictive, studies show that chronic sugar overconsumption can alter neuronal pathways in the brain. Emotional stress and challenging early life experiences can also contribute to sugar cravings. Strategies to quit sugar addiction include behavioral interventions, nutritional strategies, and government regulations like sugar taxes to deter people from buying sugary products. Long-term sugar overconsumption is considered extremely dangerous for health, regardless of weight gain.</p>

          <p>Kenbishi, Japan's oldest sake brand, remains committed to traditional brewing methods despite declining domestic consumption in the sake industry. Brewing always takes place during the winter season. Starting in October, 60 brewers stay onsite for six months, eating together in the dining room. The company prioritizes using traditional wooden equipment, such as dakidaru, to maintain the taste of its sake, even though it is more costly. President Masataka Shirakashi believes preserving these methods is essential to protecting the brand's heritage. Kenbishi also produces traditional wooden equipment for other industries, including soy sauce and vinegar makers.</p>
