          <p>During an emotional public hearing, Texas lawmakers and flood survivors criticized the disorganized and delayed response of local officials to the deadly July 4 floods. Key Kerr County officials, including the emergency coordinator and sheriff, admitted they were asleep or unavailable as the disaster unfolded. Survivors shared harrowing stories of loss, including one woman who lost her parents and 11-year-old daughter, pleading for better warning systems. The hearing highlighted systemic failures in communication and emergency preparedness in the region that saw the most fatalities.</p>

          <p>The gunman who killed four people in a Manhattan office building had a valid concealed carry permit from Nevada, despite a documented history of mental health incidents. The 27-year-old legally purchased a handgun with the permit and acquired an AR-15-style rifle in a private sale from his supervisor. The incident highlights the complexities and loopholes in state-by-state gun regulations, as New York's stricter laws could not prevent the shooter from transporting the weapons into the city. This has renewed calls from officials for a national assault weapon ban.</p>

The approximately $200 million cost will be covered by the president and other private donors, with construction set to begin in September. The new venue is intended to host large state functions for up to 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents on the White House grounds. The administration stated the design will respect the architectural heritage of the existing building.</p>

The visit coincided with plans for a U.S. special envoy to inspect aid distribution in Gaza and growing diplomatic tensions, including an Israeli minister accusing Germany of supporting Nazism.</p>

          <p>Following a Los Angeles Times investigation, a city councilmember has filed a motion to compel Los Angeles to comply with a 2019 state law requiring a public analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The law was enacted after the deadly 2018 Camp fire, but the city has so far failed to include the required safety analysis in its general plan. The motion demands a report on the capacity, viability, and potential bottlenecks of routes in high-risk areas, especially in the context of wildfires and tsunamis.</p>

Sales in China also rebounded, growing 4% after previous declines, and the services division continued its steady expansion.

The author argues that this could create a significant funding gap, potentially preventing many working-class students from pursuing these careers and exacerbating existing shortages of health professionals and public interest lawyers.</p>

          <p>The emergency management coordinator for Kerr County, Texas, testified that he was sick and asleep when catastrophic flash floods struck the region on July 4, killing at least 135 people. His admission came during a state hearing where officials faced intense scrutiny over their preparedness and response. Survivors also gave harrowing testimony, including a woman whose daughter and parents were killed, describing how the river they loved so much had turned deadly and how her daughter's body was identified only by a charm bracelet.</p>

          <p>President Trump has sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Eli Lilly, demanding they take steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. In the letters, he threatened to "deploy every tool in our arsenal" to combat what he termed "abusive drug pricing practices" if the companies fail to comply by September 29. The move is part of his administration's ongoing effort to tie U.S. prescription drug costs to the much lower prices paid in other developed nations.</p>

          <p>A researcher at Texas A&M University, who is a legal permanent resident, was detained by immigration authorities for over a week at the San Francisco airport and is now facing deportation. The 40-year-old man, who has lived in the U.S. since age five, was returning from his brother's wedding in South Korea when he was detained, reportedly due to a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge from 2011. His attorneys argue that holding him at the airport denied him due process under the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement campaign.</p>

The proposed league, spearheaded by James's business partner Maverick Carter, would feature a touring format similar to LIV Golf and Formula One. A key feature of the new venture is that it aims to offer players equity stakes, something currently prohibited for active athletes under NBA rules, potentially creating an attractive alternative for top talent.</p>

Announcing the revival alongside famous athletes, Trump framed it as an important part of his mission to "make America healthy again."

          <p>A new study published in the journal *Cell* has solved a long-standing mystery about the origin of the potato, revealing it evolved from a tomato ancestor. Researchers found that around 9 million years ago, a hybridization event occurred between an ancient tomato and a wild potato species from Chile. This interbreeding combined a gene from the tomato parent that tells the plant to form tubers with a gene from the wild potato that controls their growth, resulting in the starchy vegetable known today.</p>
