            <p>Danish shoppers are increasingly boycotting U.S. products in response to President Trump's trade policies and his interest in Greenland. Retailers are making it easier to identify European-owned brands, and consumers are expressing a preference for European goods over American ones. This boycott reflects a broader shift in consumer sentiment, with some travelers also avoiding trips to the U.S. due to trade tensions and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The situation highlights the potential economic consequences of political disputes on consumer behavior and international trade dynamics.</p>

            <p>Major League Baseball (MLB) is increasingly attracting private equity investors due to major shifts in player salaries and media rights. MLB does not have a salary cap for its players — unlike the National Football League, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League — which has led to some of the biggest contracts in sports and major pay disparities. Institutional investors aren't going to commit and risk their capital when all it means is it's helping to fund an arms race of talent. The league is also recalibrating its media rights strategy as regional sports networks continue to suffer. (not investment advice)</p>

Less than a week later, on April 6, 1917, the U.S. declared war on Germany. It would be another four months to the day before Arthur Zimmermann stepped down as foreign minister.</p>

This rapid growth takes an enormous toll on the chickens’ bodies, with many in pain due to lameness, or difficulty walking.</p>
