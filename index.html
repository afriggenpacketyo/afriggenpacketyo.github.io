          <p>President Trump is pressuring Senate Republicans to quickly unite behind a sweeping policy bill that encompasses his domestic agenda. However, the measure faces opposition, including from Elon Musk, who has emerged as a powerful new adversary. The bill's future hinges on whether Trump can rally enough support within his own party to overcome these challenges. The outcome of this legislative battle will significantly impact Trump's ability to deliver on his promises and shape domestic policy. Optimism around this bill is waning due to internal and external opposition.</p>

          <p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have declared roads leading to aid distribution centers in Gaza as "combat zones," prompting the closure of these sites for a day. This decision follows an incident where at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near a distribution center. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US and Israel-backed aid network, has also temporarily closed its sites for organizational improvements. Humanitarian organizations continue to warn of insufficient access to food and water for Palestinians in Gaza, while the GHF aims to replace the UN-led aid distribution network amid accusations of hijacked supplies by Hamas. This situation highlights the dire conditions and challenges in delivering aid to Gaza civilians.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Arkansas have released a new possible headshot of Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," who escaped from prison last week. The updated image shows Hardin with facial hair and a slimmer appearance, contrasting with his previous mugshot. The search for Hardin is focused in north central Arkansas, and investigators are relying on tips from the public. The reward for information leading to his capture has increased to $25,000, and an investigation is ongoing to determine how he obtained a corrections officer uniform to aid his escape. The public is urged to contact the FBI with any information.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The levy remains at 25% for the UK, contingent on the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) from May 8. However, the order stipulates that the UK levy could rise to 50% if it fails to comply with the terms of the EPD by July 9. A UK government spokesperson affirmed the commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel, as part of their plan for change. This decision highlights the complex trade relationships and negotiations between the US and its allies.</p>

          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is considering Michael Boren, an investment consultant and ranch owner, to lead the U.S. Forest Service, despite his history of conflicts with the agency.

During the confirmation hearing, Boren acknowledged the disputes but expressed his commitment to making forest management more resilient and healthy, emphasizing the importance of timber production on federal lands.

          <p>Middle and major powers in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, using trade, investment, and technology as tools of influence. This strategy involves balancing and maneuvering between two other powers to build leverage and reduce dependency.

The approach is prominent in a world where post-war institutions are declining and multilateral commitments are being reassessed.

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has lifted the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a punishment for past misdeeds. The removal of the growth restriction reflects the bank's progress in addressing its deficiencies and fulfilling the conditions required for its termination. The asset cap had prevented Wells Fargo from growing key lines of its business for years, but now it can increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division. Wells Fargo shares rose more than 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering longstanding U.S. immigration policy. The proposal would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe difficult to meet given existing backlogs. Even if the processing average is reached, asylum-seekers would have to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit. Advocates fear this could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and drive them to work illegally.

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with fines and legal action over policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports. This follows a transgender athlete winning two statewide high school track-and-field events. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division called California Interscholastic Foundation (CIF) policies "unconstitutional," alleging they deprive female students of athletic opportunities. President Trump singled out the athlete on social media and said that "large scale fines" will be imposed on the state. California's Attorney General's office is reviewing the letter and monitoring the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is considering renaming multiple naval ships named after civil rights leaders, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named after the slain gay rights leader. Documents show proposed timelines for the name change, which coincides with Pride Month. Other vessels on the Navy's renaming "recommended list" include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman. The memo said the renaming of naval ships was to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture."</p>
