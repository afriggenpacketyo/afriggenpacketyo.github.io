          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 09:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's praise for Coca-Cola's plan to offer a cane sugar version, health experts are weighing in on the nutritional differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. While there are minor chemical and metabolic distinctions, with some concern over corn syrup's higher fructose content, dietitians largely agree that both are empty calories with similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. The American Heart Association recommends limiting intake of all added sugars, including both cane sugar and corn syrup. Experts emphasize that moderation is the most important factor for health, as both sweeteners contribute to inflammation and dental issues.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified his position on the Federal Reserve, stating that Chair Jerome Powell should not resign despite calls from President Trump. Bessent reiterated his belief that the central bank needs an internal review of its non-monetary policy operations, which he feels have grown without sufficient oversight. He suggested that leading such a review could be a positive legacy for Powell, allowing him to "right-size" the Fed's functions. This stance contrasts with the White House's direct pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates and criticism of its building renovation project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent financial updates from major European auto manufacturers reveal the substantial negative impact of U.S. tariffs on foreign-made vehicles and parts. Stellantis reported an initial hit of around 300 million euros, with a potential full-year impact of up to 1.5 billion euros, while Volvo Cars saw a sharp decline in its second-quarter operating profit. In response, some companies like Volvo are shifting production to their U.S. plants to mitigate costs. The article highlights the auto industry's vulnerability to these trade policies due to its highly globalized supply chains and the looming threat of further tariff increases.

Other innovative ideas being tested include allowing pets as passengers on certain routes. These measures are a response to a dramatic drop in passenger volume since 2019, as commuters increasingly turn to subways, bike-sharing, and ride-hailing services, leaving bus operators in financial distress.</p>

          <p>Howard Phillips, a 65-year-old man from Essex, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia under the UK's National Security Act. Phillips offered to provide personal information about former Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian agents, who were actually undercover British intelligence officers. Prosecutors stated he applied for a job with the UK Border Force as part of his plan and offered his "100% loyalty and dedication" to a foreign power in exchange for payment. His ex-wife testified that he was infatuated with espionage and dreamed of being like James Bond.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union, caught between U.S. tariff threats and China's economic influence, has an opportunity to strengthen its negotiating position. With the U.S. threatening steep tariffs, the EU could engage more pragmatically with China to gain leverage. The piece suggests the EU should reconsider its alignment with U.S. tech restrictions against China, especially as the U.S. itself relaxes some controls. By re-evaluating its stance, the EU could potentially secure better trade terms with both superpowers and use its relationship with China to influence geopolitical issues like the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives remains at a standstill for the second consecutive week as a dispute over the Jeffrey Epstein files has paralyzed the Rules Committee. Republicans recessed a meeting to avoid a vote on a bipartisan amendment, pushed by Democrats, that would compel the release of the files. This stalemate has prevented several other bills, including one on immigration, from reaching the House floor for a vote. Majority Leader Steve Scalise indicated it was unlikely the committee would reconvene this week, leaving key legislation in limbo before the upcoming August recess.</p>

          <p>A French court has sentenced three individuals to prison for human trafficking, finding them guilty of exploiting undocumented migrant workers during the 2023 champagne harvest. The director of a servicing company and two recruiters housed over 50 workers from West Africa in squalid, unhygienic conditions, with victims describing the treatment as being "like slaves." The case has drawn scrutiny to labor practices in the renowned Champagne region, which is also facing another inquiry into the use of Ukrainian workers.

          <p>This article provides a snapshot of average mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates as of late July 2025, noting the challenging market for homebuyers due to high rates and limited housing inventory. As of July 21, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.75%, while a 15-year was 5.95%. The piece advises that borrowers with strong credit scores in the mid-to-high 700s are most likely to secure the best rates. It also suggests that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring some relief to borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

The company posted adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share on revenue of $12.62 billion.

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Boston Red Sox in a bizarre walk-off victory decided by a catcher's interference call with the bases loaded in the 10th inning. Phillies batter Edmundo Sosa's swing made contact with the glove of Red Sox catcher Carlos Narvaez, automatically awarding him first base and allowing the winning run to score. This marked the first time a Major League Baseball game has ended on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1971. The unusual ending concluded a tight game, giving the Phillies a 3-2 victory without putting a ball in play during the final inning.</p>

          <p>The cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by an average of £221 per month over the last three years, creating significant financial pressure on tenants. According to property portal Zoopla, some renters are being forced to turn down jobs or move to more affordable areas, while others rely on financial help from their parents. The sharp increase is attributed to high demand and a shortage of available rental properties. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, the overall cost remains a major burden for many, making home ownership seem unattainable.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece uses the viral story of a couple caught on a Coldplay concert's 'kiss cam' to critique modern surveillance culture and the internet's appetite for public shaming. The author notes how quickly internet sleuths identified the individuals, who were colleagues, leading to a media frenzy that upended their lives and subjected an innocent spouse to online harassment. The article argues that while we may be entertained by such stories, they reflect a sinister reality where personal privacy has been cheaply sold for digital convenience. It contrasts the public's lack of privacy with the heavily guarded secrecy of tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

          <p>The United States and Taiwan are exploring a collaboration on a spaceport focused on suborbital flights, a technology that could dramatically reduce travel times. According to the American Institute in Taiwan, such flights could shorten the journey between Houston and Taipei from 14.5 hours to as little as 2.5 hours. The proposed cooperation would leverage Houston's Ellington Airport, which already has a spaceport license. While still in an experimental phase, suborbital transport is being developed for tourism and ultra-fast cargo delivery, representing a potential revolution in long-distance travel.</p>

          <p>Public health officials are warning that the Trump administration's withholding of up to $140 million in funding for the CDC could severely hamper efforts to combat the overdose crisis. The Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program, which funds crucial surveillance and prevention strategies, faces significant cuts that could take effect as soon as September. Experts argue this is a major step backward, as the data collected through OD2A is vital for understanding drug supply changes and implementing effective interventions. The funding uncertainty is forcing local health departments to consider scaling back essential services, potentially reversing recent progress in reducing overdose deaths.</p>
