          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and substantially enlarge Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island off the coast of California. Trump stated that this action is necessary to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders and would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice." Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, was once home to notorious gangsters like Al Capone. The decision has been met with criticism, with some calling it an impractical and politically motivated move.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a proposal to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing a national security threat. He authorized the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of taxing foreign-produced films, claiming it's a concerted effort by other nations. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment, while industry experts questioned the scope and impact of the proposed tariff. The move could affect Hollywood's reliance on foreign locales for filming due to tax incentives and lower labor costs, potentially impacting thousands of middle-class film workers in the United States.</p>

Roses are one of the most cultivated ornamental flowers in the world and have become a symbol of love and beauty across the world.</p>

They warn that China's growing dominance in these areas could lead to a future where Chinese technology stacks become the global standard.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, best known for his starring role as the comically genteel sheriff Tom Brewster in the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94. Hutchins's character was known for his aversion to violence and preference for cherry soda over whiskey. After his success on "Sugarfoot," Hutchins found work in situation comedies and films, and later became a traveling clown. In his later years, he reflected on his experiences in show business on the website Western Clippings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced that the oil well blowout off the coast of Louisiana, which began on April 26, has been controlled. The well had been leaking oil and natural gas, contaminating nearby marshland and prompting a large-scale emergency response. Cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing, involving multiple agencies and private contractors. The incident has raised concerns about the growing problem of orphaned and aging oil wells and the capacity of federal agencies to respond to such emergencies.</p>

          <p>A U.S. tax loophole is ending, and it is forcing apparel makers that sell to America to consider alternative markets or cheaper locations in and outside China. The tariffs have made it impossible for one factory owner to continue selling on Amazon, where he previously made about $1 on every garment but now just 50 cents. As trade tensions force the worldâ€™s two largest economies apart, many businesses in Guangzhou are facing a tipping point. Some owners said they could possibly move to countries like Vietnam, where many Chinese factories have set up to avoid potential new tariffs as high as those already set on Chinaâ€™s exports.</p>

          <p>As sky-high tariffs kill U.S. orders for Chinese goods, the country has been striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market â€” a move that threatens to drive the world's second-largest economy into deeper deflation. The side effect is a ferocious price war among Chinese firms. JD.com, for instance, has pledged 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) to help exporters and has set up a dedicated section on its platform for goods originally intended for U.S. buyers, with discounts of up to 55%.</p>

He said that Hollywood was being "devastated" by the number of filmmakers and studios working overseas. If his administration follows through on the presidentâ€™s remarks, it would be the first time that a Trump tariff is imposed on services rather than manufactured goods. Trump has been using national emergencies as an enabling device to rapidly push through policies that undercut US norms and traditions, an approach that is increasingly facing legal challenges.</p>

Aside from improving the quality of care for people in need, the report found that investment in the system could also help drive economic growth. The committee also highlighted a lack of available data into the system, and called for the government to publish annual assessments of the level of unmet care needs for adults.</p>
