          <p>Indonesia and Russia have solidified their bilateral relations by signing a strategic partnership agreement during a meeting between President Prabowo Subianto and President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg. The agreement coincides with Indonesia's entry into the BRICS grouping, for which Prabowo expressed gratitude to Putin for his support. Both leaders emphasized the strengthening ties in economics, technology, trade, investment, and agriculture, with Putin highlighting Indonesia as a key partner in the Asia Pacific region. A $2.29 billion investment fund was also agreed upon between Danantara Indonesia and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, showing a commitment to further economic cooperation. Despite concerns from Western allies, Indonesia maintains a non-aligned foreign policy, seeking close ties with various countries, and recently upgraded its relationship with the US to a comprehensive strategic partnership, as well. The optimism score for this event is reasonably high, reflecting stability in international relations and economic cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering military action against Iran, specifically targeting the Fordo nuclear site, due to concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities. He has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of such a strike, with some sources indicating he believes disabling the site is necessary. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision has not been made, pending potential negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear program. The UK is engaging in active diplomacy to find a resolution, with foreign ministers from several countries planning to meet with Iranian officials. Given the volatile nature of the situation and the potential for escalation, the optimism score reflects the uncertainty and risk associated with the possible military action.</p>

President Trump is considering a U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear program, with a decision expected within two weeks. JPMorgan has warned that regime change in Iran, a major oil producer, could lead to significantly higher oil prices, with supply losses being challenging to recover quickly (not investment advice).

The video-sharing app faces a potential ban unless it is sold by ByteDance, as lawmakers fear the Chinese government could access US user data. Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law for the third time, expressing his desire to keep the app online for its 170 million US users. A deal for the sale of TikTok in the US by ByteDance must now be reached by September 17, with authorities in Beijing needing to approve any sale.

Carroll was awarded $83.3 million in damages after a New York jury found Trump liable for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her accusation of sexual assault.

          <p>The principal of Dundee University and two senior members of its governing body have resigned following a damning report into the financial collapse that led to a Â£22m government bailout. The independent report cited poor financial judgment from university bosses and weak governance from the university court as the main causes. It found that almost Â£40m of ringfenced money had been spent elsewhere and there had been a lack of real action to address an Â£8m hole due to a fall in international student recruitment. The report criticized a lack of openness and challenge at all levels, with a former principal described as having an overbearing leadership style.

          <p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is now requiring lawmakers to provide 72 hours of notice before visiting detention centers, a move that has sparked outrage. This new guidance follows a series of tense visits from Democratic lawmakers to detention centers amid Donald Trump's crackdowns on immigrant communities.

          <p>Roberto Minervini's "The Damned" offers a unique perspective on the Civil War, focusing on the dazed souls and gnawing uncertainties of the soldiers rather than large-scale combat. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army in 1862, emphasizing their everyday lives and internal struggles. Minervini's naturalistic style and collaboration with his cast create an intimate atmosphere, exploring themes of economic inequality, senseless brutality, and thwarted masculinity. While the film has limitations due to its overdetermined nature, it serves as a perceptive exploration of an America still in conflict. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the film's artistic merit and its commentary on enduring societal issues.</p>
