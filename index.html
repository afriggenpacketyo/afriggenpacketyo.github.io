          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at an airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law, Seo, was hired despite lacking experience in the aviation industry, in exchange for the airline's CEO leading a state-funded agency. The indictment comes amid a series of prosecutions against officials in Moon's administration, with his Democratic Party condemning the prosecution as politically motivated.

The company expects AI server demand to remain relatively unaffected by tariffs, while demand from consumer electronics is expected to benefit from new AI-enabled products.

          <p>Chinese robot manufacturers remain confident despite escalating US tariffs, citing their unique product offerings and limited international competition. At the Canton Fair, Dolphin Robot Technology's automated cafe garnered significant interest and orders, despite the US-China trade war. The company is not absorbing the tariff costs or lowering prices, as US customers have strong demand and comparable products from other countries are more expensive. The company's fifth-generation robotic cafe, boasting nearly 100 patents, faces little competition.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive actions aimed at reshaping higher education and K-12 schools, including efforts to rein in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. One action targets college accreditors, alleging they have abused their authority by imposing discriminatory DEI-based standards. Another action promises new discipline guidance for K-12 schools, aiming to ensure policies are based on objective behavior rather than DEI. The orders seek to cement Trump's conservative agenda in education, rolling back policies from the Biden administration and bolstering workforce training.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, accusing him of harming peace negotiations. Trump claimed a deal to end the war was 'very close' but Zelenskyy's stance would prolong the conflict. Vice-President JD Vance outlined a US vision for a deal that would freeze territorial lines near their current positions. Ukraine has consistently stated it will not concede Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.</p>

Trading Standards officers are finding illegal vapes hidden in various locations, and the health risks to consumers are significant.

While Japanese law imposes penalties for overstaying, some argue that those who do so due to unavoidable circumstances should be given another chance. The article also notes that Japan lags behind other countries in adopting more neutral terms for undocumented immigrants.</p>

One of the mammals was a eutherian, and the other was a gobiconodontid, a group known to include Repenomamus, which previously had dinosaur bones found in its stomach.

The bill, proposed by Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, a former Edison executive, would limit the energy credits to 10 years and end incentives if the house is sold. Supporters argue it will alleviate the financial burden on non-solar ratepayers, while opponents claim it will undermine the state's commitment to renewable energy and harm those who invested in solar systems. Environmental groups and the solar industry are uniting to oppose the bill.</p>
