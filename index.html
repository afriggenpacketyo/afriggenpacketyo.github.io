          <h2>US Announces Plans for 35% Tariff on Canadian Imports Starting August 1</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 23:38:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump cited Canada's failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. as a primary justification for the new levy. The announcement warns that the tariff rate could increase further if Canada chooses to retaliate with its own duties, escalating the ongoing trade dispute between the two closely linked economies. This move is part of a broader strategy that includes raising tariffs on other global trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off around 1,800 domestic employees following a Supreme Court decision that permits the Trump administration's plan to reduce the federal workforce. The move is part of a broader reorganization effort initiated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline operations and eliminate what the department considers redundant offices. Deputy Secretary Michael Rigas informed staff that affected employees would be notified shortly, marking the final stage of a restructuring plan first unveiled in April. The administration has framed these cuts as a necessary measure to make the department more efficient and functional.</p>

The discussion is expected to cover a range of contentious issues, including trade disputes, the status of Taiwan, and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.

          <p>As China prepares to release its economic performance data for the first half of the year, analysts are closely watching for signs that may necessitate further fiscal stimulus. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% target, concerns persist about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and the impact of U.S. trade policies. Economists are increasingly advocating for more robust government support to counteract external pressures and ensure the full-year growth objectives are met. The upcoming data will be critical in determining whether Beijing needs to implement more forceful and targeted measures to stabilize its economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a significant boom in the sales of electric-powered heavy trucks, a trend that is increasingly displacing diesel consumption and impacting oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and a rapidly expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged by 175% in the first half of the year. This rapid adoption, primarily for short-haul routes in industrial areas, has led analysts to revise down their forecasts for diesel demand and accelerate predictions for when China's overall oil consumption will peak. The shift is seen as a key factor in the country's transition towards cleaner energy in the transport sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey of travelers in Southeast Asia reveals a significant decline in the appeal of the United States as a travel destination. Respondents cited concerns over potential discrimination, the actions of the Trump administration, and gun violence as more significant deterrents than travel costs. According to the survey, nearly 80% of Southeast Asian travelers feel the U.S. is losing its allure, with one in four reporting their interest has waned in the past six months. This trend reflects a broader shift in global perceptions, although interest remains higher among travelers from countries with large diasporas in the U.S., such as the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>

The court also ordered the three men to complete a 40-hour sexual violence treatment program. Taeil's management agency, SM Entertainment, had removed him from the group in August 2024 after the allegations surfaced, acknowledging the seriousness of the criminal case. The incident involved the assault of a foreign tourist who had been drinking with the men.</p>

          <h2>An Analysis of the Formula Behind Effective Political Slogans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for creating the perfect political slogan by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages. The research suggests that eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—resonate most effectively with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. These words act as "emotional shortcuts," helping to build memorable and impactful messages like "Putting People First" or "It's Time." While not a guarantee of victory, the analysis provides insight into the linguistic building blocks of successful political communication in an era of increasingly sophisticated, AI-driven messaging.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Trainspotting" author Irvine Welsh reflected on his career, his new novel "Men in Love," and his concerns about modern society. Welsh argues that the internet and social media have become controlling forces that are causing human intellect to atrophy, leading to a "post-culture society" of "natural stupidity." He expressed nostalgia for the 1990s, an era he feels people "had lives" before being constantly tethered to devices. The author, whose work often explores social decay, believes society is in a massive transformation where economic precarity is becoming the norm for nearly everyone.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, an opinion piece by Australian minister Ed Husic reflects on the international community's pattern of inaction in the face of mass atrocities. The article shares the story of a Srebrenica survivor and questions why the declaration of "never again" is so frequently repeated yet rarely heeded, citing the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide as prior examples. The author draws a direct and poignant parallel to the current suffering in Gaza, asking when the world will move beyond being inert spectators and take decisive action to prevent such tragedies. The piece is a powerful call to break the cycle of witnessing, belatedly condemning, and ultimately failing to prevent mass human suffering.</p>

          <p>With the UK experiencing its third heatwave of the year after a record-warm spring, analysis shows that such extreme weather is becoming more frequent due to human-influenced climate change. Scientists warn that global warming disproportionately increases the intensity of heatwaves, making them 3-4°C warmer in the UK than they would be otherwise. While many compare current heat to the legendary summer of 1976, data shows that 2025 has been hotter on average and that such events are no longer isolated occurrences. Projections indicate that hot spells will become an even more regular feature of UK summers, especially in the southeast.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea, the country with the world's lowest birth rate, is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. This trend is attributed to a generational shift, with more people choosing to delay parenthood for social and financial reasons and then turning to medical technology like IVF to start families later in life. While the nation's demographic crisis remains severe, the growing demand for fertility services offers a sign that the desire for children persists among many South Koreans.</p>

The research, published in Nature Geoscience, warns that the most extreme and rarest heat events are changing the fastest, underscoring an urgent need for adaptation strategies. In Southern California, these longer heat waves are expected to increase wildfire danger, threaten agriculture, and pose greater risks to human health and infrastructure.</p>
