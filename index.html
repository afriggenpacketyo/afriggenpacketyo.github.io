          <p>Vance Boelter faces charges for the murder of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the attempted murder of Senator John Hoffman and his wife. The FBI revealed that Boelter also targeted the homes of other lawmakers on the same night, conducting surveillance and researching his victims beforehand. According to Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson, Boelter disguised himself as a police officer and carefully planned his attacks, making this a political assassination. The investigation uncovered a list of names and addresses of other public officials in Boelter's vehicle, indicating a larger planned attack that was thwarted by law enforcement. The charges include stalking, murder, and firearms offenses, and Boelter's next court hearing is set for June 27, 2025.</p>

The conflict's ripple effects could involve Hezbollah, Iraqi Shiite militias, and Houthi rebels, leading to maritime disruption and increased control in the South China Sea.

Judge Allison Burroughs is considering arguments for a preliminary injunction, with Harvard's lawyers arguing that the proclamation violates its First Amendment rights. The government argued that it does not trust Harvard to monitor foreigners and raised concerns about the university's foreign entanglements with the Chinese government.

          <p>Roksana Lecka, a 22-year-old nursery worker from Hounslow, west London, has been convicted of abusing 21 babies, including kicking one in the face and stepping on another's shoulder. Lecka admitted to seven counts of cruelty to a person under the age of 16 and was found guilty of another 14 by a jury at Kingston Crown Court. Her crimes were discovered after she was sent home for pinching children, and CCTV footage revealed her pinching, scratching, pushing, and even kicking the children in her care. The incidents occurred at two nurseries between October 2023 and June 2024, and Lecka will be sentenced on September 26.</p>
