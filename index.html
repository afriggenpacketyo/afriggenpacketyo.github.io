          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government stepped in to halt a strike by 10,000 flight attendants that had stranded over 100,000 travelers. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the union and the airline into binding arbitration, citing the need to protect the economy and supply chains. While the airline plans to restore its schedule over the next week, the union has criticized the government's intervention as a violation of workers' rights. The core of the dispute remains unresolved, with flight attendants seeking higher pay and compensation for on-the-ground work, which they argue the airline's latest offer failed to adequately address.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's refusal to accept a ceasefire is complicating peace negotiations, just before his scheduled meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Following a summit in Alaska, Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected without robust security guarantees. Zelenskyy emphasized that stopping the violence is a prerequisite for any meaningful peace talks and plans to coordinate with U.S. and European partners, including the leaders of Germany and the European Commission, who will join the White House meeting. Meanwhile, Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine continue across the country.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has lodged a formal complaint with Japan after several Japanese cabinet members and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba made offerings to the Yasukuni Shrine. The shrine honors Japan's war dead, including convicted war criminals from World War II, making such visits highly controversial among neighboring countries. China's foreign ministry condemned the act as a "blatant provocation against historical justice," urging Japan to reflect on its history of aggression. While the Prime Minister sent a ritual offering rather than visiting in person, other high-profile politicians, including the Finance Minister, paid their respects at the shrine.</p>

          <p>Demonstrators across Israel participated in widespread protests and a general strike, calling on their government to secure a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza and to end the war. In Tel Aviv, protesters blocked major highways and unfurled a large flag with portraits of the remaining captives. The protests reflect growing public pressure and fear that continued military operations could further endanger the hostages. The demonstrations were condemned by some far-right members of the Israeli government, who argue that such pressure undermines national security and pushes Israel toward surrender.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party venue and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the historic building in 2017 for £555,000 and spent nearly five years and a significant sum overcoming immense logistical challenges, including installing running water and electricity. Originally built in the 1850s to defend against French naval attacks, the fort is now equipped with 40 beds and a nightclub, ready for a new owner to define its future as a private retreat or tourist attraction.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but continues to churn over the ocean with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. While the storm is not currently forecast to impact the U.S. mainland, a tropical storm warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Heavy rain and swells are expected to affect Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as the storm moves west-northwest. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center noted the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which can cause temporary weakening before potential re-intensification.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa program, potentially preventing around 300 Russians and Belarusians who are fleeing persecution from entering the country. The decision, part of a broader move by the new government to tighten migration policy, affects individuals whose visas had already been approved by the Foreign Office but not yet issued by the Interior Ministry. Human rights organizations express concern that this leaves dissidents, including critics of the war in Ukraine, vulnerable in former Soviet countries where they risk extradition or abduction. The Interior Ministry stated the program is under review and visas will not be issued except in urgent cases.</p>

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the Social Democrats has proposed making voluntary military service more attractive, a plan that includes higher salaries and modernized training.

          <p>A 46-year-old man was dramatically rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced climber, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong current pushed him off his lines and behind the cascade. After an extensive search involving aircraft and a drone that located him, a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being reunited with his family, concluding what the sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision to end race-based affirmative action, some advocates are promoting class-based preferences as a legal alternative to foster diversity in higher education. This approach would give an admissions advantage to economically disadvantaged students of all races. However, there is growing concern that the Trump administration may oppose this method as well, viewing it as a proxy for achieving racial diversity. The administration's recent demand for detailed admissions data from universities is seen as a move to scrutinize for any policies that result in racially diverse outcomes, potentially challenging both race- and class-based systems.</p>

This high-stakes political gamble could potentially shift control of Congress but requires approval from both the state legislature and voters, who have previously supported independent redistricting.

The movie's protagonist, a matchmaker, treats relationships like a market, appraising clients' value to find a suitable match. The commentary argues this mirrors reality, where dating apps have fostered a consumerist logic and economic pressures have made a partner's financial stability a critical consideration for many. This has led to what sociologist Eva Illouz calls "emotional capitalism," where romantic decisions follow the logic of economic exchange, blurring the lines between love and financial security.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, has returned to the top of the world rankings for the first time in four years after defeating Argentina 41-24 in their Rugby Championship opener. The All Blacks established a strong lead in the first half, but had to withstand a spirited second-half comeback from the Pumas. Two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho ultimately sealed the victory for New Zealand in Cordoba. The win, combined with South Africa's loss to Australia, was enough to propel the All Blacks back to the number one spot.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led states of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced they are sending hundreds of National Guard members to Washington, D.C. This deployment is in support of the Trump administration's federal intervention in the city, which aims to address crime and homelessness by federalizing local police forces. The move represents a significant escalation of federal control over the capital and has been met with protests from residents who decry it as a "fascist takeover" and military occupation. City officials have noted that violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Reflects on How Life Experience Deepens Appreciation for Renaissance Art</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 03:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores how a person's perception of art, particularly Renaissance masterpieces, can evolve dramatically with life experience. The author recounts her own journey from being a cynical student who found such art unrelatable to someone who, after experiencing trauma and motherhood, found profound emotional resonance in the works of artists like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo. The piece connects the timeless themes of motherhood, grief, and love in these historical works to contemporary art, such as a Jenny Saville exhibition, and to the shared human condition, suggesting that an openness to art reflects an openness to life.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the undercover operation that led to the capture of Bryan Patrick Miller, the man responsible for the infamous "canal murders" in Phoenix in the early 1990s. In 2015, a cold case detective met with Miller, a person of interest, at a Chili's restaurant under the pretext of a casual conversation. The real purpose was to covertly collect his DNA from a water glass. The sample was a perfect match to DNA found on the victims, leading to the arrest and eventual death penalty conviction of Miller, who was known locally for dressing as a character called the "Zombie Hunter."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift, the Trump administration has brokered a deal allowing companies like Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for sharing 15% of their revenue with the U.S. government. President Trump presented the arrangement as a personally negotiated deal to benefit the country, reversing an earlier block on the chips' export. However, trade experts have raised serious concerns, suggesting the policy sets a "dangerous precedent" that export controls are for sale and questioning the legality of what is effectively an export tax.

          <p>The National Museum of China is hosting a major exhibition of works by the 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, which has been curated to emphasize the artist's "Russianness." The exhibition, organized with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, focuses on Repin's connection to St. Petersburg and Russian culture. This presentation comes at a time of geopolitical significance, as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition highlights how cultural figures can become part of broader diplomatic and national identity contests.</p>
