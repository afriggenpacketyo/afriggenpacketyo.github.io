          <p>President Trump, following a Middle East ceasefire deal, affirmed Hamas's commitment to disarm, stating the U.S. would enforce it if necessary, potentially with violence. He emphasized rebuilding Gaza, devastated by two years of conflict, estimating costs upwards of $70 billion. However, the article notes Trump deferred specific visions for Palestinian statehood and Gaza's governance to later discussions. The initial phase of the peace plan saw the return of living Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, though disputes arose over the return of deceased hostages' remains, highlighting the agreement's fragility.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in the case of Pedro Hernandez, convicted of murdering Etan Patz. A federal appeals court ordered a retrial or release for Hernandez due to a trial judge's error regarding the voluntariness of his confessions. Prosecutors are seeking 90 days to decide on a new trial, while defense attorneys argue for a shorter 30-day period.

Key bills include SB 243, requiring AI chatbots to have guardrails against promoting self-harm and sexually explicit content, and AB 316, which removes a civil legal defense for AI developers regarding harm caused by their products. AB 621 increases penalties for creating nonconsensual 'deepfake' AI pornography.

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, poised to become Japan's first female prime minister, faces a more challenging route to power after coalition partner Komeito abruptly withdrew. This departure left Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) with a smaller minority in the Diet, opening the door for a potential opposition unity candidate. The article notes that while the LDP remains the largest bloc, a united opposition could surpass its seat count, particularly in a runoff vote for prime minister. Analysts offer mixed views, with some suggesting the coalition's collapse might free the LDP to pursue long-delayed policy goals.</p>

          <p>A major three-year study has found that specially designed group singing classes are clinically effective in treating new mothers experiencing postnatal depression. The research, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, showed that participants in singing groups experienced sustained symptom reduction for up to six months post-intervention, outperforming traditional support methods. This article highlights how the classes foster social connection and provide a safe space, with early results also indicating a decline in stress hormone levels.

This article notes that OpenAI has since made improvements, allowing for accurate representation of Smith's disability. However, other individuals with disabilities, like Naomi Bowman, still encounter AI altering their features.
