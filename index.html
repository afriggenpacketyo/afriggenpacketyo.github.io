          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife are being sued by four Hispanic women, former housekeepers, who allege sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and workplace violations, seeking $50 million in damages. The women claim Robinson repeatedly sexually assaulted them, with some claims dating back to 2007, and that his wife failed to prevent these acts despite prior knowledge of similar cases. The Robinsons' attorney denies the allegations, calling it an extortion attempt and asserting the evidence will show the claims are false. The defense plans to ask the court to dismiss the lawsuit, with Robinson expected to respond personally in the future.</p>

          <p>Slovakia and Hungary are among the eastern European nations strongly opposing the European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by 2027, viewing it as "economic suicide" that threatens the region's energy security. These countries, which have maintained close ties with Moscow, argue that banning Russian energy supplies will lead to higher energy prices for consumers. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico stated that while Slovakia is ready to reduce energy dependence on third countries, completely cutting off Russian energy imports is an extreme measure that could harm the region's economy. The EU's plan aims to ensure full energy independence from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking his first such deal since imposing tariffs. Specifics of the agreement are unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm products, and taxes on U.S. tech companies. The announcement's timing is notable given the upcoming UK-EU summit and Trump's recent comments downplaying the need for trade deals. The agreement may initially focus on tariff relief in specific sectors.</p>

          <p>The British film and television industry is expressing concern over President Trump's suggestion to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands," fearing it could devastate the industry already recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes. With a significant portion of film and TV production spending in Britain coming from the United States, the industry worries that uncertainty about tariffs could halt its progress. The British government is in discussions with the U.S. administration, and experts question how such tariffs could be enforced given the international nature of film production.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the late Agatha Christie is "teaching" an online writing course, reanimated using AI and her own words, leading to ethical questions about the use of AI to resurrect the dead. The course, offered by BBC Maestro, uses a digital prosthetic built with AI and a script based on Christie's writings, with the approval of her family. While some argue it's a harmless way to share her craft, others raise concerns about consent, authenticity, and the potential for blurring boundaries between fact and fiction.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are employing powerful Earth-based radar, including the world's largest radio telescope, to search for water ice at the moon's south pole. A recent study suggests that lunar ice is fragmented, scattered, and buried deep beneath the surface, making detection and extraction challenging. These findings will help in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of the proposed China-led research base on the moon. The results align with previous impact experiment findings and provide new evidence that water ice exists on the moon.</p>
