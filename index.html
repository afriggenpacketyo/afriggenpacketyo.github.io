          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is scheduled to visit the Philippines to enhance security cooperation, including a General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). This agreement aims to improve regional surveillance of China's activities in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait by enabling the protected exchange of classified military information and defense technologies between the two US allies. Analysts suggest that China views this strengthening US-Japan-Philippines security alignment as a potential confrontational bloc near its borders. The GSOMIA will combine Japan's reconnaissance capabilities with the Philippines' strategic geographical advantage.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's domestic security agency Shin Bet, of lying to the Supreme Court. This accusation is the latest development in a legal battle surrounding Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss Bar, citing a lack of trust. Bar has alleged that Netanyahu's decision to remove him was motivated by a desire for personal loyalty rather than professional considerations, leading to an exchange of accusations in court affidavits. The case was brought by Israeli watchdog organizations and opposition parties challenging Netanyahu's decision to oust Bar.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict have provided a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians, who are wary of a US-brokered peace plan perceived as favorable to Moscow. After meeting with President Zelensky, Trump questioned why President Putin would continue the war if the United States is trying to broker peace talks. Trump suggested that Putin may need to be dealt with more firmly, potentially through increased sanctions. This stance signals a possible shift from the Trump administration's previous stance, which Ukraine rejected as a lopsided peace deal.</p>

          <p>U.S. airstrikes in Yemen's capital have reportedly killed at least eight people, according to Houthi rebels, amidst an ongoing American military campaign that has carried out over 800 individual strikes in the past month. The U.S. military's Central Command stated that "Operation Roughrider" has killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders, targeting missile and drone programs. The U.S. asserts that these strikes are necessary to counter Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and to deter Iran's support for the Houthis. The strikes have drawn criticism due to the lack of transparency regarding targets and civilian casualties, with activists warning that civilians have likely been killed.</p>

These include the right to be paid for all work-related activities, including meetings and training, the legality of discussing salaries with coworkers, and the fact that company policies do not supersede labor laws. The discussion also touched on the possibility of claiming unemployment while still employed if hours are significantly reduced, the financial capacity of companies to pay higher salaries, and the potential for employees to complete their work in less than 40 hours a week. The thread also mentioned the value employees bring to a company, the definition of wage theft, and the role of HR. </p>

          <p>Despite challenges posed by the Trump administration's policies, the aging wind energy industry in America is undergoing a "repowering" era, creating new business opportunities for key players. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from the need to upgrade or replace older turbines. Repowering existing wind farms offers economic advantages, such as avoiding the need to acquire new property and increasing electricity output. The U.S. currently has approximately 1,500 onshore wind farms, with a growing number of turbines nearing the end of their lifecycle, driving the repowering trend.</p>

          <p>The BBC has identified members of Kenya's security forces who fatally shot anti-tax protesters at the country's parliament in June 2024. An analysis of over 5,000 images revealed that the victims were unarmed and posed no threat. Despite a parliamentary committee ordering an investigation, no report has been issued and no one has been held accountable. The BBC's investigation traced fatal shots back to specific rifles used by a police officer and a soldier, highlighting the events of the protest and the response from security forces.</p>
