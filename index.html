        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, revealing deep divisions in the country. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist path under Nawrocki's leadership, succeeding Andrzej Duda. While most day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president influences foreign policy and can veto legislation, hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill promises to reverse laws politicizing the court system. Nawrocki, endorsed by Trump, has echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine, promising continued support but criticizing President Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers by creating the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS). This initiative aims to redesign flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago, allowing planes to climb and descend more smoothly. Aviation Minister Mike Kane said that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a sustainable future. The changes would be the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, accommodating the significant increase in flights over the years.</p>

          <p>Opposition party leader Lee Jae Myung is projected to win South Korea's snap presidential election, triggered by the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, holds a sizable lead in opinion polls, and is expected to contend with reviving South Korea's economy and completing a tariff agreement with the U.S. While both Lee and his rival share goals like economic growth and housing affordability, they differ on economic policy platforms. Goldman Sachs notes that fiscal policy under Lee is likely to be more expansionary, while monetary policy by the Bank of Korea will likely offset the gap.</p>

The decision comes amid uncertainty surrounding the future of his scandal-hit Miyagino stable, which has been closed since April 2024 due to a protege's physical abuse of junior wrestlers. Hakuho, now known as elder Miyagino, plans to return from Mongolia and hold a press conference on his retirement day.

          <p>Investigative journalist Christo Grozev, known for unmasking Russian spies and exposing the 2020 poisoning of Aleksei Navalny, became a target of President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin enlisted a disgraced finance executive, who had been recruited by Russian intelligence, to track and assassinate Grozev. However, the plot was foiled, and the team involved is now imprisoned, though the financier lives freely in Moscow. The trial of the Bulgarian nationals involved marked a rare successful prosecution of Russian agents operating on British soil, highlighting the ongoing threat posed by the Kremlin to silence its opponents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a "Gold Card" program, offering wealthy foreigners a fast track to U.S. residency for a $5 million fee. This proposal has sparked interest among wealthy individuals seeking easier access to the U.S., though some experts consider the price underpriced given the potential time and hassle saved. While the administration touts potential benefits like reduced taxation on foreign earnings and VIP perks, details remain unclear.

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Istanbul for another round of U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending the ongoing conflict. Despite previous attempts, negotiations have failed to achieve a sustained ceasefire, with both sides maintaining firm positions on key issues. The talks occur after Ukraine launched a surprise drone attack on strategic bomber bases inside Russia, prompting retaliatory strikes. While diplomatic efforts continue, the situation remains tense, with accusations of deception and sabotage from both sides.</p>

Studies suggest that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, possibly due to increased parental attention. Sibling influence can be powerful, spurring individuals to pursue different paths or emulate specific interests. While birth order archetypes are often simplistic, siblings act as vivid mirrors, challenging flaws and providing a unique perspective on oneself.</p>
