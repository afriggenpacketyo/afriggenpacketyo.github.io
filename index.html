          <p>After weeks of tensions following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India and Pakistan have engaged in a dangerous escalation involving missile strikes and drone warfare. Pakistan accused India of initiating the conflict by targeting its air bases with air-to-surface missiles, prompting a retaliatory response targeting Indian air bases and a missile storage site. The exchanges have intensified despite diplomatic pressure and warnings from international bodies, raising concerns about regional stability and the potential for further escalation. The article highlights the use of drones as a new tool of war and the fears of residents caught in the crossfire, with both sides mobilizing troops and suspending cricket leagues due to safety concerns. The conflict underscores the deep-seated animosity between the two nations, which have fought three wars over Kashmir.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility while protesting the opening of a private immigration detention center in Newark. Baraka, along with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation, argued that the facility was dangerous and illegal, alleging it lacked proper permits and inspections. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security denies these allegations, claiming the facility detains dangerous individuals. Baraka was charged with trespassing and later released, with Governor Murphy expressing outrage over the arrest, and members of congress alleging the arrest was meant to intimidate.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's armed forces reported retaliatory strikes on military sites inside India, responding to earlier Indian missile attacks on three Pakistani air bases.

The escalation follows a deadly attack in India-controlled Kashmir that India blames on Pakistan, an accusation Islamabad denies. Pakistan's military spokesman condemned the Indian actions as a major provocation.

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus but stranded in Earth orbit since 1972, is predicted to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.

          <p>A guest essay in The New York Times argues that the ongoing military conflict between India and Pakistan marks a dangerous shift in their rivalry, eliminating diplomatic space and increasing the risk of escalation. The author, Asfandyar Mir, attributes this shift to India's rise as a geopolitical power and its growing impatience with Pakistan's actions in Kashmir. He also notes Pakistan's internal crises and its determination not to back down. The article highlights the erosion of traditional guardrails, the diminished role of the United States as a crisis manager, and the potential for nuclear conflict. The author urges international intervention to de-escalate tensions and restore equilibrium.</p>
