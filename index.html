          <p>Fitch Ratings expresses concern that Southwest Airlines' new baggage fees and other policy changes, including assigned seating and expiring flight credits, could negatively impact the airline's customer satisfaction and potentially backfire.

Exceptions exist for credit card holders and elite frequent flyers, but the overall change represents a significant shift in the airline's business model.</p>
