          <p>A prominent vaping lobbyist, Tony Abboud, is under scrutiny for his ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) while simultaneously lobbying the Trump administration to protect the flavored vaping industry. Abboud's Vapor Technology Association (VTA) has a formal partnership with the Electronic Cigarette Industry Committee of the China Electronics Chamber of Commerce (ECCC), an entity of the CCP. Critics argue that Abboud's connections prioritize Chinese companies over American interests, while supporters claim he's focused on combating the illegal e-cigarette trade and supported Trump's re-election efforts. The controversy highlights the complex intersection of politics, business, and international relations in the vaping industry.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a Republican "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if they trigger a recession. Cruz expressed concern that the tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, could harm the U.S. economy and result in job losses. While Cruz stated his desire for the administration's trade policies to succeed, he emphasized that success should involve lower tariffs both domestically and abroad, benefiting American workers and businesses.</p>

The White House's method of dividing the trade deficit by the value of imports to determine tariff rates lacks economic justification and deviates from established trade policy principles.

          <p>A finalized deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations to a new American-owned company has reportedly been stalled due to escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. After months of negotiations, the Chinese government has allegedly withheld approval of the deal until negotiations can be held regarding Trump's tariffs. The situation leaves the future of TikTok's U.S. operations uncertain and dependent on the resolution of the broader trade conflict between the two countries.</p>
