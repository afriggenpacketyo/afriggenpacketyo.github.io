          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:09:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is actively working with Jordanian authorities on plans to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This initiative comes as the government faces increasing pressure, with over a third of MPs signing a letter urging the recognition of a Palestinian state. The effort aims to alleviate the severe humanitarian crisis, though some critics describe aid drops as largely symbolic and insufficient, advocating instead for Israel to open all border crossings for comprehensive aid delivery. The move highlights the delicate balance of providing immediate relief while navigating complex regional politics.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old man, initially given less than a year to live due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has made a remarkable recovery after receiving a double-lung transplant. The dog trainer, who had no symptoms until a routine scan revealed the terminal disease, was initially hesitant about the procedure but eventually agreed. After a challenging wait and post-surgery complications, his lung capacity is now at 98%. He has returned to his life with family and is training a new therapy dog, which he has named Encore to celebrate his own second chance.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its 72-year history, the PLA Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students for its undergraduate programs. The ten students were accepted after achieving top scores on their university entrance exams, marking a significant milestone for the institution and China's military. Founded in 1953, the academy has progressively expanded its educational offerings and is now breaking new ground by including women in its submarine training, reflecting a notable shift in the country's naval recruitment policies. One incoming student expressed a desire to dedicate herself to national defense.</p>

          <p>According to his great-granddaughter, the 1930s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood at the time of his death but never lost his identity as a cowboy from Oklahoma. The article details his journey from trick-roping in a Wild West show to becoming a beloved movie star, author, and columnist with a massive following. Despite his fame and friendships with celebrities and presidents, he remained a 'common man' at heart, using his Hollywood income to fund his passions for travel and ranch life. His death in a 1935 plane crash was a moment of national mourning.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the escalating political fallout for Donald Trump as new information continues to emerge regarding his past association with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The article argues that Trump's typical distraction tactics are failing to quell public and media interest, and his furious reactions only serve to heighten suspicion that he has something to hide. It analyzes the potential political damage, noting discontent even among his base, and speculates on whether the renewed focus on the Epstein case could become a significant and lasting liability for the former president.</p>

          <p>A small but growing number of young Israeli Jews are choosing to face prison time rather than perform mandatory military service, citing moral objections to the IDF's actions in Gaza. These 'refusers' often experience significant social consequences, including being branded as traitors and losing friendships and family support. The article shares the personal stories of individuals like Itamar Greenberg, who spent six months in a military prison for his stance. While the movement remains on the fringes of Israeli society, it highlights a deep-seated ideological conflict among some of the nation's youth.</p>

The article identifies four critical stories that it claims are being overshadowed: America's accelerating national debt crisis, a resurgent global hunger crisis, the transformative challenge of global population decline, and a degrading U.S. military readiness in the face of new geopolitical threats. It posits that while the Epstein story is significant, these other long-term, systemic problems will have a far greater impact on the future.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government initiative led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is intensifying the debate over ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and their link to chronic diseases. While many snacks and sodas are considered UPFs, the category also includes foods like tofu, some cereals, and nut milks, creating a challenge for developing a clear, universal definition for policymaking. Experts suggest that while research continues, the focus should be on minimizing certain UPFs rather than targeting the entire category, as some processed foods can still be part of a healthy diet.</p>

          <p>Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's newly appointed prime minister, is already facing a wave of criticism, much of it overtly sexist, with observers dismissing her as a mere "loyalist" to President Zelensky. The article places this reception in the context of other female leaders in Eastern Europe, such as Moldova's Maia Sandu, who faced similar disparagement before proving to be effective reformers. Despite Svyrydenko's extensive experience in international negotiations and economic policy, she must contend with entrenched biases against female leadership as she takes on her new, critical role.</p>

          <p>This cultural essay grapples with the complicated legacy of Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs, once a celebrated icon of Black cool, ambition, and success. The author reflects on the profound influence Combs had on a generation during the 1990s, who saw him as a model for achieving success without compromising authenticity. This admiration has now curdled into a sense of betrayal and heartbreak, as the inspirational image of "Puffy" has been shattered by the recent, horrific revelations of his cruelty, abuse, and depravity.</p>

          <p>Intensifying summer heat waves, driven by climate change, are fundamentally altering American life by forcing people indoors for extended periods, which may be contributing to a form of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The article explores the concept of "summer SAD," where a lack of sun exposure, reduced social interaction, and disrupted routines due to extreme heat can lead to symptoms of depression. This emerging mental health challenge highlights another profound way climate change is impacting human well-being, turning a season of fun into one of avoidance and isolation.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Columbia University's recent deal with the Trump administration marks a dangerous turning point for American higher education. To restore its federal research funding, the university agreed to pay a $200 million fine and submit to federal monitoring of its admissions and academic departments. The author contends that this capitulation to what is described as a political "extortion scheme" sacrifices academic independence and sets a grim precedent, suggesting other universities will likely face similar pressure to bend to the administration's will.</p>
