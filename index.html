          <p>The United Nations World Food Programme has issued a stark warning that nearly one-third of Gaza's population is going for days without food, leading to a surge in severe malnutrition. The report highlights that 90,000 women and children are in urgent need of treatment, with the death toll from malnutrition surpassing 120. Amidst the crisis, a former U.S. security contractor has alleged witnessing war crimes, including the use of live ammunition on civilians at food distribution sites by Israeli forces and U.S. contractors. International pressure is mounting on Israel to lift restrictions on aid, with several European nations calling for an end to the humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled the design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor, marking a significant step in its nuclear energy ambitions. The gigawatt-level facility, which is now awaiting final approval, is projected to become operational after 2030 and aims to provide a more fuel-efficient power source. This development positions China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, which are also developing advanced reactor technologies. The announcement was made at an event in Fujian province, attended by key officials from China's national energy and atomic authorities.</p>

          <p>The British government has strongly condemned Hong Kong's latest offer of cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in the UK. In a joint statement, Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper labeled the move an act of "transnational repression." Hong Kong authorities are offering up to $125,000 for 19 individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law. The UK reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the rights and safety of all individuals within its borders, including the thousands of Hong Kong residents who have relocated under a special visa program.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank, California, executed a dramatic dive shortly after takeoff, dropping 300 feet in 36 seconds to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft.

          <p>In an innovative approach to improving hurricane prediction, researchers are fitting sharks with advanced sensors to gather critical ocean data. This project, led by the University of Delaware in collaboration with NOAA, uses mako and white sharks to collect information on water temperature and conductivity, which are key factors in hurricane formation and intensity. The sharks act as mobile, efficient ocean sensors, providing data from areas that are difficult for traditional robotic gliders or satellites to access. By turning these apex predators into data collectors, scientists hope to feed more accurate information into hurricane computer models and better understand seasonal storm threats.</p>

The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early butterfly sightings. While beneficial for some species and for lavender cultivation, the relative lack of rain is causing concern.

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, alleged that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents were unlawfully thwarting enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins affirmed that the decision not to participate in federal immigration enforcement is protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker both praised the decision, stating it supports public safety by allowing local police to focus on community needs.</p>

          <p>The New York Historical Society has opened a new exhibit detailing the story of the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history when entertainment professionals were persecuted for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted in 1947 for refusing to answer questions from the House Un-American Activities Committee. It explores how the anti-Communist fervor destroyed careers, compelled individuals like Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan to testify, and raised enduring questions about free speech, privacy, and democracy that remain relevant today.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores Donald Trump's multifaceted relationship with golf, portraying it not just as a pastime but as a core part of his business and political identity. The sport serves as a venue for high-stakes networking, where he has forged relationships with world leaders like Japan's Shinzo Abe and political allies. For Trump, who owns numerous courses worldwide, golf is both a prized business asset and a fiercely competitive endeavor. While critics and former partners recount his penchant for cheating, the article notes that tee time with the president remains a coveted opportunity for those seeking influence and access away from public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity, known as proffer immunity, for her recent interviews with the Department of Justice. This protection allowed her to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for approximately nine hours without her statements being used against her later. This type of immunity is commonly used when prosecutors are trying to secure cooperation, although Maxwell has already been convicted and sentenced. The development comes amid questions about President Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein and calls for greater transparency, with Maxwell's lawyer stating no deals have been made in exchange for her testimony.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to rescue the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. The disease spread from non-native animals introduced to the region. In a rescue mission, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, protected mountain range. A recent follow-up confirmed the relocated sheep have survived and are now breeding, with newborn lambs spotted, offering a sign of hope for the native species' recovery.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks has collapsed, with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff announcing the U.S. team's departure from Qatar and blaming Hamas for the breakdown. Witkoff stated Hamas's response showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire," prompting a consideration of "alternative options" to free the hostages. The negotiations have been deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war, which Israel rejects. The diplomatic failure occurs as the U.N. reports that children in Gaza are starving to death due to the ongoing blockade and aid restrictions.</p>

          <p>A feature article delves into the science and expert opinions behind popular health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, and sleeping seven to nine hours per night.

For instance, a kidney specialist suggests thirst is a reliable guide for hydration, whereas a nutritionist points to dehydration as a cause of fatigue and other symptoms. The article concludes that while benchmarks are useful, a balanced and adaptable approach to a healthy lifestyle is more practical than fixating on specific numbers.</p>

While the boxes contain high-calorie staples like pasta, lentils, and flour, specialists note serious deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, zinc, and vitamin C. An expert from the London School of Economics described the contents as a "'first aid' food basket" that provides a "full stomach but an empty diet," which could lead to hidden hunger and disease over time.
