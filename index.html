          <p>The United States is reviewing its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, known as Aukus, to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure to increase its military spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP. Some analysts suggest the review might lead to a shift in focus away from submarines, while others warn that a US withdrawal would be a victory for China, which has long criticized the deal. The agreement, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines and share cutting-edge technology.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has named eight new advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, replacing the previous 17 members. Kennedy's picks include individuals who have publicly criticized vaccine recommendations and questioned their safety, circumventing the usual CDC selection process. The selections have sparked controversy, with some health experts expressing concern about the lack of transparency and the potential for undermining public confidence in vaccines. Kennedy maintains that the appointees are committed to evidence-based medicine and will demand definitive safety data before making new recommendations.</p>

The GHF aims to distribute aid without it being diverted by Hamas, a challenge that the United Nations has struggled with.

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say alters the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons, found in Mongolia, represent the closest known ancestor to all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. This discovery reveals an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, showcasing early stages of features like strong jaws. The new species provides insights into how tyrannosaurs evolved to become dominant predators in North America and Asia.</p>
