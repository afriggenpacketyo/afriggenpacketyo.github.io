          <p>Europe's pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruptions as President Trump considers imposing tariffs on pharmaceuticals as part of his plan to reorder global trade. This move could significantly impact the flow of drugs like insulin, heart treatments, and flu vaccines from the European Union to the United States, which currently constitute the bloc's top export to America. The tariffs could affect the affordability and availability of crucial medications in the U.S. market, potentially reshaping the pharmaceutical trade landscape between the two regions.

          <p>Australia, once a welcoming destination for international students, is now considering capping their numbers due to concerns over unaffordable housing. Politicians are debating whether limiting international student intake can alleviate the housing crisis, a pressing issue for voters ahead of the upcoming election. This shift represents a significant change for Australia, where international education has been a major economic driver. Some worry that restrictive policies may damage Australia's reputation as a global education hub and could negatively impact the economy.</p>

          <p>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has faced severe criticism after deporting three American children along with their undocumented mothers to Honduras.

One of the children, suffering from metastatic cancer, was allegedly deported without medication or medical consultation, raising serious concerns about the well-being of the affected families.
