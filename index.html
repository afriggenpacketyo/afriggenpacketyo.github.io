          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell investigation. The judge criticized the DOJ's motion as "disingenuous," stating the materials would not reveal any significant new information about the crimes of Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. The ruling emphasized the long-standing principle of grand jury secrecy and suggested the government's request was more for public relations than genuine transparency.</p>

          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly supported Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following President Trump's call for his resignation. In a Financial Times piece, Moritz described the attack as "artless bullying" and urged the Intel board to show "backbone" and stand by Tan. The controversy stems from concerns raised by Trump and Senator Tom Cotton over Tan's alleged ties to China, which Tan has dismissed as misinformation.</p>

This move ensures staff will receive a share of future profits and have a say in the company's direction, preserving the business's family-oriented and ethical values. The decision was made as part of a succession plan to maintain the company's legacy rather than selling it for purely financial gain.</p>

The proposed Women and Child Protection Act aims to circumvent shield laws in other states that protect doctors who provide telemedicine abortions. This legislative effort represents a new strategy to enforce the state's strict abortion bans by targeting the logistics of medication abortion.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will hold a press conference to address violent crime in Washington, D.C., following a White House directive to increase the presence of federal law enforcement in the city. The move comes after Trump intensified his criticism of the city's leadership and threatened to federalize its police force if local officials don't act. D.C. officials have condemned the action as an overreach and an encroachment on the district's home rule.</p>

          <p>Total sales of electric vehicles in China fell by 5% in July compared to the previous month, marking the first month-on-month drop since May. The decline is attributed to automakers offering smaller discounts, which has cooled the enthusiasm of price-sensitive consumers. This follows a government warning against escalating price wars, as authorities worry that intense competition could undermine the long-term health of a key sector of the Chinese economy.</p>

          <p>Enterprise AI company C3 AI saw its stock fall by 30% after releasing disappointing preliminary first-quarter financial results and announcing a sales organization restructuring. CEO Thomas Siebel called the sales performance "completely unacceptable," attributing it to the reorganization's disruptive effect and his own ongoing health issues. The company reported a wider-than-expected operating loss, compounding concerns as it also searches for a new chief executive.</p>

          <p>According to money psychology expert Morgan Housel, a common mistake, especially among intelligent investors, is overcomplicating their investment strategy. He argues that a simple, boring approach, such as periodically investing in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund, is more effective for long-term gains. This passive investing philosophy is famously endorsed by Warren Buffett, who has long advised that it allows average investors to outperform most professionals over time. (not investment advice)</p>

While it allows the companies to access the lucrative Chinese market, it raises questions about the government's role in business and whether this "pay-to-play" tactic will be applied to other sectors. The arrangement also creates a confusing message regarding national security, which was the original justification for banning these chip sales.</p>
