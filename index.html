          <p>The Unite union has suspended UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership over her role in the ongoing Birmingham bin strikes. The decision was made during the union's conference, where it also resolved to re-evaluate its broader relationship with the Labour Party. Rayner has been publicly encouraging the striking sanitation workers to accept a deal proposed by the Labour-controlled city council to end the long-running dispute. This escalating conflict is notable as Unite is a major financial donor to the Labour Party and has previously supported Rayner directly.</p>

          <p>Two residents, a woman in her 90s and another in her 80s, have died after a car crashed into a care home in Sunderland, UK. The incident occurred following a police chase involving a stolen vehicle, which caused significant structural damage to the building and led to the evacuation of other residents. Northumbria Police have since rearrested two 21-year-old men on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the crash. The case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to the preceding pursuit.</p>

          <p>A German tourist, Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for 12 days in the remote Australian Outback. The 26-year-old was discovered by a member of the public on a forest trail in a fragile condition but without serious injuries. Her ordeal began after her van apparently became stuck in the mud in the vast Karroun Hill Nature Reserve. Police, who had located her abandoned vehicle a day earlier, described her survival in the hostile environment as a miracle and a remarkable story of endurance.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown has pleaded not guilty to two additional charges related to an assault at a London nightclub in 2023. The charges include assault causing actual bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon, specifically a bottle. This follows his earlier not guilty plea for the more serious charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to music producer Abraham Diaw. The incident, which occurred at the Tape nightclub in Mayfair, was reportedly captured on surveillance video, and Brown remains out on bail.</p>

          <p>Central Texas experienced deadly flash floods that killed over 120 people, with Kerr County being the hardest-hit area. The disaster, which also struck Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River, was caused by a convergence of storms and moisture from a former tropical storm. This weather event produced extreme rainfall in a region known as "Flash Flood Alley," which is particularly vulnerable due to its steep, rocky terrain. Pre-existing drought conditions exacerbated the flooding, as the parched ground was unable to absorb the sudden deluge of water.</p>

          <p>Police in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, have arrested a man for shooting and killing his 16-year-old daughter in a case of a so-called "honor" killing. The father allegedly murdered his daughter after she refused his demand to delete her TikTok account. Authorities reported that the family initially attempted to present the death as a suicide. This incident is part of a disturbing pattern in the country where women and girls face violence from male relatives for perceived breaches of strict social codes, including their online presence and behavior.</p>

          <p>A hosepipe ban affecting over five million households across Yorkshire is likely to remain in effect until winter, according to the water company's chief executive. The restriction, the first regional ban in the UK this year, was implemented after the area experienced its driest and warmest spring on record. Yorkshire Water stated the measure is necessary to protect reservoir levels amid forecasts of more dry weather. The company has faced public criticism over its own leakage rate, which is higher than the national average.</p>

          <p>Fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have held a ceremony in Iraqi Kurdistan to mark a significant first step toward ending their 40-year armed conflict with Turkey. Approximately 30 militants, including several commanders, symbolically destroyed their weapons by setting them on fire in a large cauldron. The event follows a call from the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the group to formally disband and disarm. The Turkish government has hailed the ceremony as a critical moment in achieving peace and stability in the region.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the AVP professional beach volleyball league is holding matches inside an NBA arena, the Intuit Dome in Inglewood. The unique venue required a massive logistical effort, including trucking in 300 tons of sand from a quarry in Palm Springs to construct a regulation court on the arena floor. The move is part of the AVP's new league model, which aims to grow the sport's exposure by bringing events to unconventional locations. The indoor setting offers a different playing experience, free from the sun and wind that typically influence outdoor matches.</p>

          <p>A sociological study of Germany's executive class reveals that social mobility at the highest corporate levels is extremely limited, challenging the notion of a meritocracy. Research by sociologist Michael Hartmann found that over 80% of Germany's economic elite originate from the top 3-4% of the population, a figure that has barely changed in a century. Even with identical academic qualifications, children of executives are 17 times more likely to join a major company's board than their working-class peers. The study suggests that social origin, personal presentation, and shared interests often outweigh merit in hiring decisions.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed maglev train prototype designed to travel at speeds of up to 600 km/h (373 mph). Developed by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), the train aims to fill the speed gap between existing high-speed rail and air travel. If put into commercial service, the train could reduce the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai from 5.5 hours to just 2.5 hours. The prototype will now undergo further testing and viability assessments before it can be deployed on the country's rail network.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister, Yusuf Tuggar, has firmly stated that his country will not yield to pressure from the Trump administration to accept Venezuelan nationals deported from the United States. Tuggar characterized the U.S. request as an attempt to strong-arm African nations, stating that Nigeria has enough of its own problems without taking in prisoners from other countries. The minister suggested the pressure campaign, which reportedly extends to other African nations, is a key factor in recent U.S. diplomatic actions, including changes to visa policies and threats of tariffs related to Nigeria's participation in the BRICS+ bloc.</p>

          <p>This article explores the public's muddled and often contradictory attitude toward plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures like Botox and filler. While such treatments have become more normalized and are often praised when the results are subtle and impressive, they are met with ridicule and moral judgment when perceived as "bad" or overly noticeable. The online reaction to reality TV stars and influencers with visible work highlights this double standard. Critics argue that society encourages women to pursue beauty at all costs but then shames them if their attempts to meet those standards are deemed unsuccessful or unnatural.</p>

Through their perseverance and the support of their coaches at Life University, they successfully advocated for rule changes at both the collegiate (NAIA) and national (USA Wrestling) levels.

While the 1985 benefit for Ethiopian famine relief united billions and set a new precedent for global charity events, it has since faced criticism for its lack of diversity and for promoting a "white savior" narrative of Africa. Organizer Bob Geldof defends the event's impact, pointing to the millions raised and the political pressure it created to cancel debt for poor nations.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 35% tariff on all imports from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump linked the new levy to cross-border fentanyl trafficking and warned of further increases if Canada were to retaliate. The move escalates trade tensions and comes with additional threats of a blanket 15% or 20% tariff on other global trading partners. The policy's future is also subject to a pending U.S. court of appeals hearing that could challenge its legality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 22 million Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace could face sharp premium increases in 2026. This is because a recent tax cut bill signed into law by President Trump did not extend the enhanced premium tax credits that have been in place since 2021. These subsidies, which are set to expire after 2025, have significantly lowered insurance costs and doubled ACA enrollment. Health policy experts warn that without an extension, average premiums could rise by over 75%, and millions could become uninsured. (not investment advice)</p>
