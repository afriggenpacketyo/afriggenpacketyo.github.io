          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left another critically injured. Fire officials described the event as an "unfathomable tragedy," noting that first responders rescued dozens of people from the building, many of whom were immobile. While the building had sprinklers, the cause of the fire is still under investigation, with officials highlighting the danger of smoke inhalation. The incident has prompted an outpouring of support and condolences, with a focus on providing mental health resources for the affected first responders and families.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo was briefly hacked, leading to the publication of antisemitic and racist messages. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the show, confirmed the breach and stated the "disgusting messages" were removed and the account has since been secured. The incident occurred amid broader concerns about the rise of hate speech on the social media platform since its acquisition by Elon Musk. The hack adds to a growing list of high-profile accounts being compromised for malicious purposes, highlighting ongoing security vulnerabilities on the platform.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee has issued a notice of intent to sue the North Carolina state board of elections if it proceeds with a plan to purge nearly 100,000 voters from the rolls. The Republican-majority board voted to require these voters to use provisional ballots if they haven't provided specific identification numbers. The DNC argues this move effectively disenfranchises registered voters and violates the National Voter Registration Act. This legal threat unfolds against the backdrop of North Carolina's status as a critical battleground state with a history of closely contested elections.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has proposed a theory that President Trump's tariff policies have not caused significant inflation because of a surge in "patriotism." He argued that Americans are choosing to buy domestic products, which has driven down demand for imports so much that it has offset any price increases from tariffs. This claim has been met with skepticism from other economists, who point to factors like importers stockpiling goods and suggest the White House's data methodology may understate the true effects of the duties.

          <p>An Australian man has been charged with "malicious mischief" after allegedly using a kilt-wearing attacker to smash the glass case holding the Stone of Destiny at Perth Museum in Scotland. The stone, an ancient and powerful symbol of Scottish nationhood, was reportedly not damaged in the incident. The 335-pound sandstone block has a long and storied history, including being used in monarch coronations for centuries. The suspect has been detained until his next court hearing.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, trading above $120,000, driven by a combination of significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and growing optimism around new U.S. crypto legislation. Lawmakers are beginning what has been dubbed "Crypto Week" to deliberate on a series of bills aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest the rally is being fueled by long-term institutional buyers who are discounting short-term market risks and showing confidence in the cryptocurrency's future.

By not winning the group, the Lionesses will face Sweden instead of eight-time champions Germany in the quarterfinals. Perhaps more importantly, they are now on the opposite side of the knockout bracket from 2023 World Cup winners Spain, meaning they cannot meet the tournament favorites until a potential final. While Sweden is a formidable opponent, the overall path to the final is now considered by many analysts to be more favorable.</p>

This marks the first recorded death from the disease in the county in 18 years. Pneumonic plague is caused by the same bacterium as bubonic plague but can be spread through airborne droplets. Health officials stated the death is not believed to be connected to a recent, large-scale die-off of prairie dogs in the area, but they have issued public guidelines for avoiding contact with wild rodents.</p>

          <p>China's export growth saw an acceleration in June, largely fueled by a rush of orders from U.S. companies seeking to import goods during a temporary tariff reprieve. While exports to the United States still fell compared to the previous year, the decline was significantly smaller than in May. This short-term boost was a result of importers trying to stock up before a looming August deadline when higher tariffs could be reinstated. However, analysts predict this growth will slow as trade tensions and high tariffs are likely to persist. (not investment advice)</p>
