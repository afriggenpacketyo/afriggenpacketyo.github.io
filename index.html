          <p>Hamas has submitted a 'positive response' to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, signaling its readiness to enter negotiations. The proposed framework reportedly includes a two-month truce, though Hamas is still insisting on guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and a permanent end to the war. While President Trump stated Israel had agreed to the terms, Israeli officials have expressed support but have not yet formally committed to the deal. This diplomatic movement occurs amidst the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>Former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey has been charged with five counts of sexual assault and one additional count of sexual assault involving three different women. The alleged offenses took place between 2021 and 2022, according to the Metropolitan Police, who began their investigation in February 2022. The 32-year-old Ghanaian international, whose contract with Arsenal recently ended, denies all charges and, according to his lawyer, 'welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name.' Partey is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in August, and both the club and football authorities have declined to comment due to the ongoing legal proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated India by five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but captain Harmanpreet Kaur was caught, ending their innings at 166-5. England's victory was anchored by a strong opening partnership, with Sophia Dunkley scoring 75 and Danni Wyatt-Hodge adding 66, although the team then suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 31 runs. A crucial bowling spell from Lauren Filer, who dismissed key Indian batters, ultimately turned the game in England's favor, setting up a vital fourth match.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding in Kerr County, Texas, has resulted in at least thirteen fatalities, with authorities confirming that about 20 children from a summer camp are also missing. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, causing catastrophic damage to property and loss of life. Rescue and evacuation efforts are ongoing as more rain is expected, with officials stating the region received several months' worth of precipitation in a few hours. Acting Governor Dan Patrick emphasized that the missing children are not confirmed lost but may be out of communication due to the disaster's scale.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the novel concept of a 'citizen' rather than a 'subject.' He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division and civil war, a complexity often overlooked but one that makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that understanding the flaws of the founders, such as their involvement in slavery, does not diminish their achievements but rather makes their stories richer and more accessible. He advocates for embracing this complex, gritty history to better understand America's present and future challenges.</p>

          <p>Health advocates and policy experts are warning that the multitude of different names for Medicaid programs across various states is causing significant confusion and leading to people unknowingly losing their health coverage. Because the program is not consistently branded as 'Medicaid,' many beneficiaries may not realize that notices about changes or termination of their state-specific plan, such as 'Husky Health' or 'MassHealth,' apply to their Medicaid benefits. This lack of awareness means individuals and families might not discover they are uninsured until they seek medical care and are denied coverage, creating a critical gap in access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's new spending bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits but instead introduces a new temporary deduction. The article clarifies that the legislation provides a 'bonus' deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 with incomes below certain thresholds, which can lower their overall taxable income. However, this is not a direct repeal of the tax on benefits, and policy experts note it will primarily benefit higher-income seniors, as many low-income recipients already pay no federal income tax.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' creates a new federal tax deduction for tipped income, a move the White House frames as a victory for the working class. The article explains that this measure creates a deduction for tips, effectively eliminating federal income tax on that portion of a worker's earnings, though it would not affect state, local, or payroll taxes. Critics, however, point out that the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and may not benefit the lowest-wage workers, as over a third of them already earn too little to have federal income tax liability.

          <p>President Donald Trump has floated the idea of hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th-anniversary celebrations next year. During a speech in Iowa, Trump suggested that an octagon could be set up to accommodate 20,000 to 25,000 spectators for the event on July 4, 2026. He mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the proposed fight. The White House has never before hosted a professional sporting event of this nature on its grounds, making the proposal a highly unusual one.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned that the project would severely harm the many protected seabird species that nest on the island. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth within 90 minutes, a potential breakthrough for military logistics. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the rocket-landing tests, according to the military publication Stars and Stripes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose 17% tariffs on all food and agricultural exports from the European Union, a move that could significantly escalate trade tensions. The warning was delivered to the EU's trade commissioner during talks in Washington and would impact a wide range of popular European products, from Irish butter to Italian olive oil. This threat is part of a broader aggressive negotiating stance as Trump's self-imposed July 9 deadline for new trade deals with over 60 countries approaches. While the EU stated that progress was made this week, it is also preparing retaliatory measures in case a trade war ensues. (not investment advice)</p>

Rescue operations are underway, but efforts to use heavy machinery are being hampered by the narrow streets of the area. Authorities believe that up to 100 people were living in the building and that more individuals may still be trapped in the rubble. Building collapses are a recurring issue in Pakistan, where lax enforcement of construction regulations and poor oversight often lead to such tragedies.

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for a record one in ten new vehicles sold in the UK during the month of June, according to new industry data. This represents a significant increase from 6% in the same month last year, driven by the rapid growth of Chinese brands like BYD and MG. This surge in the UK market is particularly notable as other G7 nations have recently imposed steep tariffs on Chinese auto imports. The trend is largely, but not exclusively, focused on electric vehicles, with analysts pointing to the UK's lack of tariffs and the popularity of EVs as key factors.</p>

          <p>High-profile left-wing MP Zarah Sultana has announced she is leaving the Labour Party to help launch a new political party with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. However, Corbyn's response suggests the project is still in its early stages, with 'discussions ongoing' about its democratic foundations. The article analyzes the potential impact of such a party, with polling suggesting it could capture 10% of the vote, primarily by drawing support from the Green Party and, to a lesser extent, Labour. While key figures from Corbyn's former shadow cabinet are not expected to join, the move highlights a perceived gap on the left of British politics.</p>
