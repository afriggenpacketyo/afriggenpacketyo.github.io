            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk's representatives, from accessing Social Security records, citing privacy concerns. Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander emphasized the need to protect citizens' sensitive information, including medical and financial records, which DOGE aimed to access for fraud detection. The judge ordered the destruction of any personally identifiable information already obtained and prohibited DOGE from installing software on SSA computers. This decision allows the Trump administration to appeal the ruling. Optimism score: 75</p>

Trump's policies, including trade wars and spending cuts, have undermined American economic performance, scientific prowess, and geopolitical influence. His tariffs have depressed consumer confidence and business investment. His administration is also undermining the rule of law. Optimism score: 25</p>
