          <p>The owners of Camp Mystic in Texas have announced plans to partially reopen next summer, one year after catastrophic floods killed 27 campers and counselors. The decision comes after the governor signed new camp safety laws, prompted by the tragedy, which include prohibiting cabins in flood zones and requiring emergency warning systems. The reopening has drawn mixed reactions from victims' families, with some criticizing the camp for moving forward while a child's body remains missing. A memorial will be built to honor those who were lost in the devastating event.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the European Union is harming its own economic and social objectives by treating China as an adversary. The author points to the EU's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which could reduce its trade deficit, and suggests a confrontational approach hinders the EU's green energy transition by limiting access to affordable Chinese clean technologies like solar panels and electric vehicles. The piece compares the EU's strategy to Don Quixote fighting imaginary giants, arguing it is a self-inflicted economic and social wound.</p>

          <p>Recent research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, including the difficult essay-based Level III. Researchers from NYU and GoodFin tested 23 large language models, finding that top-tier AIs could pass mock exams in minutes, a task that typically requires humans thousands of hours of study. While this showcases the rapid evolution of AI's analytical reasoning in finance, experts believe the technology will transform the industry rather than completely replace human analysts, who excel at understanding human context and intent.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgages in the U.S. saw minimal growth last week, with total application volume rising by only 0.6%, following a significant surge in refinancing the week prior. Despite the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate falling to its lowest level since September 2024, the market response was muted. Refinance applications increased by just 1%, while purchase applications were nearly flat. This stall in activity occurred during a volatile week where rates initially dropped before rising again following a Federal Reserve rate cut, indicating continued uncertainty in the housing finance market.

          <p>American comedian Tim Dillon has stated he was fired from the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia due to jokes he made about the country's alleged use of forced labor. In a podcast episode, Dillon said his manager informed him that organizers "didn't like" his comments about slavery. The incident has drawn attention to the broader issue of Saudi Arabia hosting major cultural events, which critics, including Human Rights Watch, describe as an effort to "whitewash" its human rights record. Several other high-profile comedians are still scheduled to perform at the festival.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, which brought powerful winds and rain to southern China, appears to have caused less damage than initially feared in Guangdong province. While cities like Shenzhen reported high wind speeds and some areas experienced power outages, the storm weakened as it made landfall and major cities began lifting restrictions by the evening. Unlike 2018's destructive Super Typhoon Mangkhut, authorities in Shenzhen reported no injuries and that the city was operating smoothly. The storm had previously caused fatalities in Taiwan and the Philippines before reaching mainland China.</p>

          <p>An independent report has found that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) engaged in unlawful surveillance practices against journalists to identify internal leaks. The review, conducted by Angus McCullough KC, revealed 21 instances of unlawful attempts to access reporters' data to find their sources, double the number previously admitted. It also criticized the practice of "washing" journalists' phone numbers through police systems to detect unauthorized contact with staff, a practice deemed not "necessary or proportionate." The PSNI Chief Constable acknowledged the need to improve processes but stated the review did not find widespread systemic surveillance.</p>

          <p>Germany is striving to become a leader in autonomous driving technology, but faces challenges including high car ownership, a strong taxi lobby, and a well-developed public transit system. While driverless vehicle projects are being tested in several cities, progress is slow compared to the U.S. and China, partly due to German manufacturers' caution about releasing immature systems. One initiative, NeMo Paderborn, is developing a "swarm" of lightweight autonomous cabs for rural and last-mile transport, aiming for a commercial rollout by 2026. Experts argue that for the technology to succeed, it must be integrated into public transit rather than just replacing private cars.</p>

          <p>A group of nearly 100 current and former doctors from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has issued a formal letter expressing urgent concerns over Trump administration policies. The physicians warn that significant staffing cuts and a rapid increase in outsourcing care to private providers are harming the nation's largest integrated healthcare system. They argue these changes threaten to divert essential resources and could lead to facility closures, forcing veterans into private systems that are ill-equipped to handle their specialized needs. The letter, protected under whistleblower law, calls on congressional leaders and the VA to address these ongoing issues.</p>

          <p>In his new book "Psychobabble," licensed psychotherapist Joe Nucci addresses harmful mental health misconceptions that have spread online due to the overuse of "therapy-speak." Nucci argues that terms like "people pleaser" and "love bombing" are often misapplied, and diagnoses should inform treatment rather than define a person's entire identity. He cautions against the belief that therapy alone can make someone "ready" for a relationship, emphasizing that real-world experience is irreplaceable. The article highlights the importance of nuance and warns that over-analyzing and self-diagnosing through social media can be counterproductive to genuine mental healing.</p>

The Tigers, who had led the division since April, are in the midst of a significant collapse, having lost seven consecutive games.

Investigators recently learned the remains were likely interred at a local cemetery.

          <p>As the Czech parliamentary election approaches, the ruling center-right Spolu coalition is campaigning on its pro-Western orientation and strong support for Ukraine. However, it is trailing the opposition ANO party, led by populist former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, by over 10 points in opinion polls. Many voters, particularly pensioners, are dissatisfied with the current government's austerity measures, despite recent positive economic indicators like lower inflation and a reduced budget deficit. Babis is campaigning on promises of a higher standard of living and is expected to potentially form a coalition with far-right, pro-Russian parties if he wins.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered survey of 1,200 senior executives reveals that a majority of multinational companies expect costs to rise due to geopolitical instability. In response, firms are accelerating their adoption of artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing to improve efficiency and offset financial pressures. Approximately 62% of respondents anticipate cost increases of 5% to 14% over the next five years, with concerns being particularly high among companies in the ASEAN region. The survey highlights that technological innovation has become as critical as trade tariffs and economic trends in shaping global supply chain strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As clear favorites to win the Women's Rugby World Cup on home soil, England's team is focused on managing the high expectations and "ignoring the noise." The Red Roses are on a 32-match winning streak and face Canada in the final, a team they have defeated in their last 13 meetings. Experts and team insiders, including defense coach Sarah Hunter who captained the team in the 2022 final loss, emphasize the importance of staying relaxed and trusting their process. The team's professional setup and a narrative focused on "unfinished business" rather than past failures are key elements in their strategy to secure the world title.</p>

          <p>Researchers have announced a major breakthrough in treating Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that runs in families. A new one-time gene therapy treatment, delivered via brain surgery, has been shown to slow the disease's clinical progression by an average of 75% in a trial involving 29 patients. The therapy works by reducing levels of the toxic protein that kills brain cells. The results have been described as "spectacular" by the research team at University College London, offering profound hope to patients and families by potentially adding decades of quality life and even preventing symptoms if administered early.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has launched an urgent review into the cost of using taxis to transport asylum seekers to appointments, following a BBC investigation. The report found that some individuals were being taken on long-distance journeys costing hundreds of pounds, such as a 250-mile trip to a GP appointment that reportedly cost £600. While asylum seekers receive a weekly bus pass, taxis are booked for other necessary travel without public transport being presented as an option. The Home Office stated it does not keep figures on total taxi expenditures, prompting criticism and calls for greater accountability.</p>

An investigation found that the federal agency held individuals for longer than the 12-hour limit stipulated in its 2011 conditional use permit on at least 25 occasions this year. The city has issued a notice of violation to the building's owner, marking an escalation in the standoff between the sanctuary city and the Trump administration.

          <p>An article written in partnership with the Prison Journalism Project details the immense challenges incarcerated women face managing their periods. With limited and poor-quality sanitary supplies, a strict cap on the number of underwear they can own, and inadequate laundry facilities, women struggle to maintain basic hygiene and dignity. The account highlights how natural bodily functions become a source of public shame in a controlled environment, exacerbated by a lack of privacy and empathy from staff, many of whom are male. The author suggests a simple change, such as providing dark-colored underwear, could be a small step toward restoring a sense of worth.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American workers are choosing to stay in their current jobs, a trend dubbed "job hugging," driven by economic anxiety and a fear of the unknown. The national quits rate has fallen to levels not seen since 2016, and hiring has slowed significantly. While low turnover might seem positive for employers, experts warn it can mask rising employee disengagement, which costs companies in lost productivity. This lack of labor market mobility also poses risks for the broader economy, potentially leading to flatter wage growth and overall stagnation as fewer workers seek out new opportunities.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the conservative and anti-vaccine movement's nostalgia for a pre-modern, "natural" past, arguing it is a dangerous fantasy. It uses figures like Robert F.

The article points out that while modern medicine has its own issues, the past was rife with deadly childhood diseases like measles and smallpox. The author concludes that relinquishing the hard-won successes of public health for a misplaced trust in nature is a lethal mistake.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's murder is being shaped to position him as the first martyr of the MAGA movement. The article draws parallels not to modern political events, but to the ancient Christian cult of martyrs, which transformed a small sect into a global religion. It posits that Kirk's specific religious identity is being intentionally blurred into a generic "Christian" who was primarily a political warrior for the cause. This process of creating a martyr, the article contends, could help the MAGA movement evolve from a personality-driven campaign into a broader, more enduring faith.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has stated that the league could begin renegotiating its massive media rights deals as early as 2026, well before the current agreement's 2029 opt-out clause. The existing 11-year, $111 billion deal is with partners like Disney, Comcast, Paramount, and Amazon. An earlier renegotiation could add billions more to the league's revenue and allow media companies to secure the highly valuable rights for an extended period. Goodell noted the rapidly changing media landscape as a reason for seeking flexibility, a move that could significantly impact team valuations and player salary caps. (not investment advice)</p>
