          <p>North Korea successfully raised a capsized 5,000-ton naval destroyer after a failed missile launch in May, according to state media. Kim Jong Un has set a deadline for the ship's complete restoration by the end of the month, viewing it as a crucial asset. An investigation into the failed launch led to the arrest of four officials, with Kim Jong Un denouncing the incident as a "criminal act." Despite the setback, North Korean media reports indicate that the damage to the warship was not severe, and it is capable of carrying various weapons, including nuclear missiles. The ship is Pyongyang's second known destroyer, potentially developed with Russian assistance in exchange for North Korean troops aiding Moscow's war in Ukraine. </p>

Japan is seeking the elimination of the higher tariffs but is also considering accepting a rate cut, though the U.S. resists a full removal of the duties. The discussions covered trade cooperation, non-tariff barriers, and economic security, as both countries aim to deepen mutual understanding. (not investment advice)</p>

Biden has denied these allegations, calling them a distraction, and the Justice Department has endorsed autopens as lawful.

The district court previously found the executives liable due to the impact of the earthquake and tsunami on the plant.

          <p>A veteran FBI agent with ties to a former official on the FBI director's "enemies list" resigned after being threatened with demotion. Two other agents were forced to move and retire, adding to the ongoing ousters within the agency. The agent's connection to a Trump critic appears to be the reason for the targeting. The situation raises concerns about potential political motivations behind personnel decisions within the FBI.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as chairman of Reform UK, citing that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time." The resignation follows Yusuf's criticism of the party's newest MP, Sarah Pochin, for calling on Sir Keir Starmer to ban the burka. Nigel Farage expressed his regret over Yusuf's departure, describing him as "enormously talented." Yusuf, who previously aimed to professionalize the party and increase its activist base, had been spearheading the "Doge" teams to cut wasteful spending in councils.</p>

The piece explores the complexities of food processing and the need for consumers to consider overall nutrition rather than solely focusing on the number of ingredients. </p>

The experiment is believed to be the start of efforts to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications that do not need encryption keys. A laser module and a phase encoding device were on board a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket that reached 2.5km during a two-minute vertical flight testing its reusability.

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention before adjudication, unlike adults who receive credit for time served. This adds months to their confinement, negatively impacting their rehabilitation and straining resources. Policy experts argue that this disparity stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to unequal application of fundamental rights. The lack of credit for time served can result in longer incarceration periods and hinder the rehabilitation process for young people.</p>

          <p>Landlords have committed $2.5 million to Andrew M. Cuomo's mayoral campaign, marking the largest example of outside spending by a single donor in the New York City mayor's race. The money will be used for campaign ads on Cuomo's behalf. This substantial contribution highlights the significant financial support Cuomo is receiving from the real estate industry. The donation is expected to have a major impact on the campaign's advertising efforts.</p>

          <h2>Rubio Sanctions ICC for Targeting US and Israel</h2>

          <p>The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has announced sanctions on four judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for "illegitimate" targeting of Israel and the US. The sanctions require all property and interests owned by the judges in the US to be blocked. The measures are in response to the ICC issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli officials and its investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan. The ICC has responded, saying it "deplores" the sanctions and that they are "a clear attempt to undermine" its independence.</p>
