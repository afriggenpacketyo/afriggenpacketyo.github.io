          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, owner of a paddleboard firm, was sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding excursion on the Western Cleddau river in Wales. Lloyd pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour in hazardous conditions. The judge criticized her "abysmal" approach to safety and noted the participants were ill-equipped and received no safety briefing. The incident occurred after heavy rain, and the group attempted to navigate a dangerous weir.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to between 50% and 65%, which would substantially reduce the duties he set at 145% earlier this month. The announcement helped lift US equities markets. Options under review include a tiered system distinguishing between strategic and non-strategic goods. A tiered structure could be phased in over five years, the Journal added. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Buprenorphine, a medication that can stop opioid cravings and reduce overdose deaths, is significantly underutilized in the United States, despite its proven effectiveness. A prevalent belief that using drugs to recover from drug use doesn't count as success contributes to this underutilization. The rise of synthetic opioids like fentanyl complicates buprenorphine use, as it can trigger severe withdrawal symptoms. America's fractured approach to recovery, prioritizing abstinence over medication-assisted treatment, hinders buprenorphine's potential to combat the opioid crisis.</p>
