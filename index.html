          <p>A former chief adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, and several others have been indicted in an alleged pay-to-play bribery scheme. The charges, announced by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, involve accusations of receiving $75,000 in bribes to steer government contracts and influence policy decisions. This development adds to the scrutiny surrounding Adams' administration, with political opponents like Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani criticizing the perceived corruption. A spokesperson for Mayor Adams has stated that the mayor himself has not been accused of any wrongdoing in this matter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with federal law enforcement and National Guard members in Washington D.C. to promote his administration's anti-crime surge in the city. During the visit, he thanked the personnel and suggested the D.C. deployment could serve as a model for other American cities like Memphis. The initiative has drawn criticism from local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called it politically motivated and unnecessary, pointing to official statistics showing a decrease in violent crime. The administration has dismissed these statistics as "phony" and continues the increased federal presence.</p>

          <p>Roborock, a leading Chinese robot vacuum company, plans to significantly reduce the price of its high-end household cleaning robots, aiming to make advanced models with AI-powered robotic arms accessible to the mass market. Company president Quan Gang predicts that such technology will become commonplace in households by 2030, driven by advances in generative AI. Despite currently high prices and mixed initial reviews for its latest model, the company is investing heavily in AI research and expanding its supply chain to Vietnam to navigate tariffs and achieve its affordability goals. This strategy is part of a larger vision where specialized AI "apps" for tasks like cleaning could be installed on various humanoid robots.</p>

          <p>Villanova University was placed on lockdown Thursday after receiving a report of an active shooter at its law school, an incident that authorities later determined to be a "cruel hoax." The false alarm triggered a large-scale response from local and federal law enforcement and caused significant panic and fear within the campus community. University President Rev. Peter Donohue confirmed that no one was injured and no firearms were found, but condemned the act for the terror it caused. The incident, known as "swatting," is being investigated by the FBI and the Delaware County District Attorney's Office to find and prosecute those responsible.</p>

          <p>First responders in New Castle County, Delaware, were reunited with a 10-year-old boy whose life they saved following a catastrophic car crash five months ago. The boy, Trey Harrison, was ejected from his mother's car after it split in half during a collision with a police vehicle.

          <p>The Kennedy Center has fired its entire dance programming team, a move confirmed by a spokesperson who stated that three individuals were terminated. This decision comes as President Trump, who recently named himself Chairman of the Center, continues to reshape the cultural institution. The firings have raised concerns among some in the arts community, with one curator noting that many have chosen to leave since the leadership change. The shake-up follows Trump's recent, surprising announcement of this year's Kennedy Center Honors recipients and a significant increase in the Center's funding through the President's "Big Beautiful Bill."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts to oust Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, following her refusal to resign amid unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. Top administration officials have publicly called for her removal, with one writing to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to dismiss her from the board, despite Powell lacking the legal authority to do so. This action represents a continued challenge to the Federal Reserve's independence by the president, who has previously demanded interest rate cuts and Powell's resignation. Cook has stated her intention to gather information to answer any legitimate questions regarding her financial history.</p>

The San Carlos Apache Tribe and other opponents are fighting the mine, arguing it will destroy a sacred religious and cultural site.

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-billion-dollar financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial. While the court upheld the finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it deemed the monetary award excessive and a potential violation of constitutional protections against severe punishment. The original ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron included a $355 million fine, which grew to over $500 million with interest. Non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York for three years, were kept in place by the appellate decision. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the ruling on the fine.</p>

This move, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a direct response to Republican-led efforts in Texas to create maps favorable to their party at the behest of President Trump. If approved by voters, the new California map could shift up to five U.S. House seats toward Democrats, effectively neutralizing potential GOP gains in Texas.

          <p>The Colorado Rapids MLS team is allowing fans to exchange jerseys of their recently traded star player, Djordje Mihailović, for a new one. This unusual move follows the club's acquisition of Paxten Aaronson as Mihailović's replacement. Mihailović requested a transfer to Toronto FC for personal reasons less than two seasons after joining the Rapids, a move that surprised the club and its supporters. The jersey swap program is being presented as a gesture of commitment to the fans and a way to mark a fresh chapter for the team as it enjoys one of its best seasons in recent years.</p>

          <p>Workday, a provider of finance and human resources software, reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations. However, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading as it issued guidance that was merely in line with estimates and highlighted challenges in specific sectors. CEO Carl Eschenbach noted that the company is facing pressure in its business with state and local governments due to funding slowdowns. He also pointed to uncertainty in the U.S. higher education sector, which is being impacted by President Trump's efforts to shut down the Department of Education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former lawyer for Donald Trump, has been serving unlawfully as the top federal prosecutor for the District of New Jersey. The judge concluded that her interim appointment had legally expired and that the Trump administration's subsequent maneuvers to keep her in the position without Senate confirmation did not comply with federal law. The ruling came in response to a challenge from defendants she was prosecuting. Habba's tenure has been marked by overt political actions, including bringing charges against a Democratic mayor and a congresswoman, which is unusual for a federal prosecutor.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coastline. While the hurricane is not expected to make a direct landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks, prompting evacuation orders and storm surge warnings. The National Hurricane Center continues to caution that the storm is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast, advising against swimming. The storm is forecast to gradually weaken over the next few days and become a post-tropical system by the weekend.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is undertaking a massive review of all 55 million foreign nationals who currently hold valid U.S. visas, searching for potential violations that could lead to revocation and deportation. The State Department confirmed that all visa holders are now subject to "continuous vetting" for any new information indicating ineligibility, such as criminal activity or overstaying. This policy is a significant expansion of the administration's immigration enforcement. It follows a recent announcement that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will also begin vetting applicants' social media for "anti-American" views as part of its screening process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining popularity among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated stocks. The process involves contributing a diversified portfolio of assets into a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before its launch in exchange for shares of that ETF. This allows the investor to avoid triggering a taxable event until they sell the new ETF shares. While the strategy can be highly effective, it has strict diversification requirements and can limit an investor's future flexibility, as their capital is then tied up in the specific ETF.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock price fell over 7% on Thursday, wiping out nearly $100 million in market value, following the company's announcement of a new logo. The redesign removes the familiar image of "Uncle Herschel," an overall-clad man leaning on a barrel, in favor of a more modern wordmark. This change is part of a broader effort by the 55-year-old chain to update its brand and menu to be more relevant. The move has drawn criticism from some conservative commentators and marketing experts, who argue the company is abandoning a core part of its well-established brand identity.
