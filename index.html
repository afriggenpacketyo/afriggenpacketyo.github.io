          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that some patients prescribed dopamine agonist drugs like Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease have developed extreme and harmful compulsive behaviors. The article details cases of gambling addiction, hypersexuality, and coercive actions, which have led to ruined finances, destroyed families, and even criminal convictions for sexual offenses. While these side effects have been known for years, the report highlights that doctors are still failing to adequately warn all patients of the devastating potential risks. The medication has been shown to tear families apart, with some patients requiring specialized care due to the dangers they pose.</p>

          <p>A labor dispute involving private waste-management company Republic Services has escalated into a multi-state strike, leaving trash piling up in numerous American cities. The Teamsters union, representing the workers, is demanding better pay and benefits, citing the high cost of living and disparities with other sanitation employees. As negotiations stall, affected municipalities are grappling with overflowing dumpsters and potential health hazards, with some suing the company for breach of contract. The strike highlights the critical role of sanitation workers and the leverage they hold when public services are disrupted.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that an explosion that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies was caused by a grenade they believed to be inert. The deputies had recovered two grenades from a garage, and one detonated at a training facility the following day. Compounding the tragedy, authorities have been unable to locate the second grenade, prompting a large-scale search and a public safety warning not to touch any discovered explosive devices. The department has since revised its policies to treat all recovered explosives as live devices.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' World Food Programme has issued a dire warning about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, stating that nearly one in three people are going for days without eating. Malnutrition is surging, with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment, and the death toll from malnutrition-related causes has surpassed 120. Israel maintains that it does not restrict aid and blames Hamas for distribution failures, while international leaders from the UK, France, and Germany have called for an immediate lifting of restrictions to avert a deeper catastrophe.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the preliminary design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. This fourth-generation technology is designed to be more fuel-efficient and represents a key part of the global competition to develop safer and more sustainable nuclear power sources. The project, located in Fujian province, is now awaiting final approval and is expected to be operational after 2030, marking a major milestone for China's atomic energy ambitions.</p>

          <p>An article explores how Donald Trump has integrated golf into his political and business life, using the sport as a venue for high-stakes networking and diplomacy. Unlike other presidents who used golf for relaxation, Trump views it as a competitive arena for forging connections with allies, world leaders, and business figures, often away from the scrutiny of the press. This approach was highlighted during his recent trip to Scotland, underscoring how he leverages his golf properties to conduct transactional meetings and build relationships in a cloistered environment.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for approximately nine hours over two days to answer questions about the sex trafficking case. Sources familiar with the meetings revealed that Maxwell was granted a limited form of proffer immunity, which prevents her statements from being used against her in court. This type of immunity is commonly used when prosecutors are seeking cooperation from an individual. Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered questions about roughly 100 different people without holding anything back.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to rescue the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. In a carefully planned operation, a team captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated mountain range. Recent follow-up observations have brought hope, revealing that the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with the birth of new lambs marking a monumental step in the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has broken down, with President Trump's special envoy stating that Hamas's response showed a "lack of desire" to reach an agreement. The diplomatic failure comes as the United Nations reports that children in Gaza are starving to death due to Israel's ongoing blockade and military offensive, which have severely restricted aid. With conflicting demands from Israel and Hamas over the release of hostages and the end of the war, the humanitarian catastrophe continues to deepen with no resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>An article delves into the science behind popular health targets, such as walking 10,000 steps, drinking eight glasses of water, and getting eight hours of sleep daily. Health and nutrition experts suggest that while these numbers serve as useful guidelines, they shouldn't be treated as rigid, all-or-nothing rules. They emphasize that individual needs vary based on factors like age, activity level, and overall health. The consensus is to focus on consistency and listen to one's body rather than stressing over hitting a specific number every single day.</p>

Wallace attributed some of his behavior to his background and a recent autism diagnosis, a defense that has drawn criticism from disability charities.

This modernizes a long-standing program, "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt," which allows patriotic or concerned citizens to give money directly to the government. While the program has collected over $67 million since 1996, it represents a tiny fraction of the nation's current $36.7 trillion debt.
