          <p>A 54-year-old man was released without charge after three people died in a house fire at a converted railway station in Rushton, near Kettering.  Northamptonshire Police stated that after a thorough investigation, no evidence of criminal wrongdoing was found.  The investigation continues to determine the cause of the fire, which caused extensive damage to the Grade II-listed building.  Potential bias: The article focuses on the police's statement and may downplay potential negligence or other factors that could have contributed to the tragedy.</p>
