        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A brief technical issue with the UK's air traffic control system caused significant travel disruptions, grounding thousands of flights and leading to numerous cancellations. The problem, which government-owned provider NATS identified as radar-related, lasted only 20 minutes but created a substantial backlog affecting major airports like Heathrow and Manchester. This marks the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting criticism from airlines and political leaders who are demanding an investigation into the recurring failures. The incident underscores vulnerabilities in critical travel infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United States is re-evaluating its energy strategy, potentially pivoting towards fossil fuels and nuclear power, which raises questions about its global leadership in the clean energy transition. This shift occurs as China solidifies its dominance in renewable technology manufacturing and control over critical minerals essential for solar panels, wind turbines, and EV batteries. Supporters of the new U.S. approach argue it is necessary for energy independence and to mitigate supply chain risks tied to Beijing. However, critics warn this could cede the competitive edge in green technology to China and negatively impact global climate goals.</p>

          <p>Meta's shares increased by over 10% following the release of its second-quarter earnings report, which surpassed analyst predictions for revenue and provided a strong third-quarter forecast. The company's sales grew 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion, driven by a significant increase in advertising revenue attributed to advancements in its AI systems. CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the company's major investments in AI, including a partnership with Scale AI, as central to its strategy for developing "personal superintelligence." Despite these gains, the Reality Labs division continued to operate at a substantial loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft's stock saw an 8% increase after the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, marking its fastest growth in over three years. The company's Intelligent Cloud division was a key driver, with revenue from its Azure platform and other cloud services growing 39% and topping $75 billion for the fiscal year. Microsoft's significant investments in artificial intelligence, including its partnership with OpenAI, have boosted sales of its commercial products like the Microsoft 365 Copilot.

          <p>A jury has found James Craig, a Colorado dentist, guilty of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela Craig, by lacing her protein shakes with poison. Prosecutors argued that Craig methodically poisoned her over several days in March 2023 with substances including cyanide, driven by a desire to escape his marriage without a divorce and collect on life insurance policies. The conviction, which carries a mandatory life sentence, came after a trial where evidence of Craig's affair and incriminating internet searches were presented. Angela Craig's family delivered emotional statements in court, remembering her as a loving mother whose life was tragically cut short.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Texas have introduced a new congressional redistricting map that could secure up to five additional seats for their party in future elections. The proposed map, drawn during a special legislative session prompted by Donald Trump, has been heavily criticized by Democrats as an extreme partisan gerrymander. The plan involves consolidating Democratic districts in urban areas like Austin and redrawing boundaries in South Texas to favor Republican candidates. Critics argue the map illegally suppresses the votes of minority communities and will face immediate legal challenges, though its fate in the conservative-leaning courts is uncertain.</p>

The company's net income more than doubled, and it saw significant growth in funded customers and total platform assets, which nearly doubled to $279 billion. This strong performance has been driven by net deposits and higher valuations in equity and cryptocurrency markets, along with growth in its Robinhood Gold subscription service. The results reflect the company's successful expansion into broader wealth management services, positioning it as a strong competitor to established brokerage firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to eliminate the "de minimis" tariff exemption for all countries, expanding a previous action that targeted China. This rule had allowed goods valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. without duties, a loophole heavily used by e-commerce shoppers on sites like Shein and Temu. The White House justified the move by stating the exemption was being exploited to evade tariffs and smuggle illicit drugs like synthetic opioids into the country.

The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Justice Alexandre de Moraes under a human rights law, a move critics call a misuse of the act.

Instead of ending the war in Ukraine, the U.S. has deepened its commitment, and recent military strikes against Iran have increased, not reduced, American entanglement in the Middle East.

This targeted approach aids domestic manufacturers of finished goods but offers little support to U.S. copper miners.

          <p>NRS Healthcare, a critical supplier of equipment for the NHS and numerous local councils in England and Northern Ireland, is reportedly on the verge of bankruptcy and could run out of cash within days. The company provides essential items like wheelchairs, hospital beds, and hoists that support patients being discharged from hospitals or living at home. Local authorities have warned that the firm's failure could have a "devastating impact" and pose a "risk to life" for vulnerable individuals. The government is now working with councils to minimize disruption and secure alternative suppliers to maintain the continuity of these vital services.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining it at a two-decade high to continue its fight against inflation. This decision comes despite persistent public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has been advocating for significant rate cuts to ease borrowing costs for consumers and the government. Fed officials are remaining cautious as inflation, while down from its peak, is still above their 2% target, and the broader economy continues to show signs of resilience. The central bank's stance highlights its independence and data-driven approach in the face of political criticism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifty years have passed since the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, the powerful and controversial Teamsters union president, yet the case remains one of America's most enduring unsolved mysteries. Hoffa vanished on July 30, 1975, after heading to a meeting with organized crime figures at a suburban Detroit restaurant, and he has not been seen since. Despite countless theories, extensive searches, and ongoing FBI investigations, what happened to him remains unknown. Hoffa's legacy is complex, remembered both as a fierce advocate for workers' rights who secured major national contracts and as a corrupt leader with deep ties to the mob.</p>
