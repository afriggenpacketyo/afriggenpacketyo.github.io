          <p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that there was no reason for Israel to launch an operation against Iran, suggesting that negotiations should be prioritized over aggressive actions regarding Iran's nuclear program. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments by expressing his desire for such matters to remain rhetorical, emphasizing Russia's stance on ensuring the security of all countries without compromising others. Putin also noted that Russia and China are not forming a new world order but are shaping it, describing the emergence of a new world order as a natural and inevitable process. Russia's perspective emphasizes diplomatic solutions and balanced security considerations in the region. The international community is closely watching these developments. </p>

          <p>Kroger's shares increased by approximately 9% following the announcement of an improved full-year sales outlook, driven by consumers seeking lower-priced store brands and alternatives to dining out. The company now anticipates identical sales, excluding fuel, to increase between 2.25% and 3.25% year-over-year. Interim CEO Ron Sargent stated that Kroger is catering to value-conscious shoppers by simplifying promotions, reducing prices on over 2,000 products, and highlighting private brands. Despite facing increased competition from Walmart and Costco, Kroger is also focusing on modernizing its business and improving the profitability of its e-commerce operations, while planning to close approximately 60 underperforming stores over the next 18 months.

          <p>A security review has been initiated across UK military bases after pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, spraying red paint on two military planes. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the incident as a "disgraceful act of vandalism." Palestine Action claimed responsibility, stating the activists evaded security and rendered air-to-air refuelling tankers "out of service," though the RAF is assessing the damage and does not expect operational impact. The Ministry of Defence is collaborating with Thames Valley Police, which is leading the investigation into the incident, which has raised concerns about national security. The activists' actions highlight ongoing tensions surrounding Britain's involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles. The ruling supports a challenge by oil and gas companies, along with Republican-led states, against a waiver that has allowed California to set tougher standards than national rules since 1967. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the government cannot target businesses through stringent regulation and then evade lawsuits by claiming the targets are unaffected bystanders. The ruling does not end California's standards but clarifies who can challenge them in court. Environmentalists argue that California's standards have been vital for cutting greenhouse gases and promoting vehicle innovation.</p>

          <p>Tesla has secured its first agreement to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, poised to be the country's largest upon completion. The project, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), involves collaboration between Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and financing firm China Kangfu International Leasing. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems are crucial for balancing electricity supply and demand, particularly with the growth of intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Tesla stated that its Shanghai factory produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter, with each Megapack capable of providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, "Far From Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C.," Senator Lisa Murkowski discusses her unique path in American politics. After losing a Republican primary in 2010, she successfully ran for re-election as a write-in candidate, which she credits to a diverse coalition of Alaskans. This victory shaped her approach as a senator, emphasizing the importance of consensus-building and prioritizing the needs of her constituents over party lines. Murkowski highlights instances where she defied party leadership, such as her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, driven by her belief in upholding the system's intended function.</p>

          <p>The conflict between Iran and Israel has prompted questions about the stability of the Islamist regime in Tehran, with some suggesting the regime's inability to protect its top officials has exposed its vulnerabilities. Exiled Iran expert Majid Golpour suggests the regime's survival depends on the emergence of a viable political alternative, while political scientist Shukriya Bradost believes a political vacuum could arise if the regime weakens significantly. The regime is attempting to use nationalist rhetoric to rally support, but public sentiment remains a mix of fear and anger over the escalating conflict. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has called for a truce, while the West remains divided on how to approach the situation in Iran.</p>

          <p>Civil society organizations are voicing concerns over the US-led peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, fearing it may overlook justice for crimes committed by armed groups. The agreement, set to be signed on June 27, lacks substantial involvement from rebel groups in eastern Congo. Analysts suggest the inclusion of amnesty clauses could undermine long-term stability and incentivize further violence. While the Congolese civil society expresses cautious optimism, they emphasize the need for careful handling to avoid repeating past failures.</p>

          <p>MPs have voted to approve Kim Leadbeater's bill on assisted dying, a significant decision regarding bodily autonomy since the legalization of abortion in Great Britain in 1967. The Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill will now move to the House of Lords for further scrutiny, with a potential return to the Commons later in the year. The government estimates it could take up to four years to establish an assisted dying service, potentially delaying its implementation until 2029 or 2030. The proposed law would allow mentally competent, terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of less than six months to request an assisted death, subject to multiple assessments and approvals.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller suggested the central bank could cut interest rates as early as July, sparking market reactions, but his optimism is tempered by potential inflationary pressures. While Waller downplays the inflationary impact of tariffs, rising crude oil prices and a declining dollar could have a more lasting effect. Additionally, rising unemployment among recent college graduates, potentially due to technological changes like AI, may not be effectively addressed by interest rate reductions. These factors raise concerns about a potential rerun of the economic challenges of the 1970s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Labour Party intends to redistribute council funding in England, allocating a greater share to more deprived areas through an overhaul of funding rules. These changes, the first in over a decade, aim to address the higher demand for council services in poorer areas. While ministers argue the current system fails to reflect these needs, rural councils have raised concerns about potential financial losses. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the changes will likely result in a significant redistribution of government funding towards deprived areas, particularly in urban regions of the North and Midlands.</p>

The study suggests that the anonymity of the screen may contribute to the higher rate of vulgarity among Americans online.
