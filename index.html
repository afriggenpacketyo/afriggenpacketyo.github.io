        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEOs of NPR and PBS, Katherine Maher and Paula Kerger, announced they are exploring options to challenge the Trump administration's executive order to cut off public funding to their organizations. Maher emphasized that these cuts would disproportionately affect local stations and their ability to cover local news, particularly in rural communities where access to news is already limited. Kerger noted that this situation is unprecedented and that they will strongly push back to protect their stations. The potential loss of federal funding could devastate local journalism and educational programming, especially in underserved areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump addressed concerns about defying the Supreme Court regarding the deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, stating that he relies on the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to determine the legality of facilitating Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador. Trump clarified that while he could ask El Salvador's president to return Abrego Garcia, the final decision rests with President Nayib Bukele. This statement comes after Trump previously indicated he "could" order Abrego Garcia's return, creating confusion about his administration's stance on the matter and the separation of powers. The situation highlights the complexities of immigration policy and the interplay between different branches of government.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised a response after a missile fired by the Houthi group in Yemen struck near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, injuring several people. The missile strike caused a temporary halt to flights and prompted major airlines to cancel flights to and from the airport. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed the airport was no longer safe for air travel. The Israeli Air Force is investigating the failure to intercept the missile, and Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with defense officials to discuss a response.</p>

          <p>A psychologist studying couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a particularly damaging statement in relationships. This comparison, often rooted in a fear of openly expressing needs, can lead to insecurity and feelings of inadequacy. The article suggests that clear and direct communication about one's needs is essential for a healthy relationship, rather than relying on comparisons that undermine a partner's self-worth. The ability to voice needs plainly is more likely when a person feels emotionally close and secure in their relationship.</p>

          <p>With America facing a shortage of millions of homes, economists and entrepreneurs are exploring ways to repurpose existing single-family homes into multifamily units. Zoning codes often restrict apartment buildings, leading developers to seek creative solutions like converting large houses into "roommate houses" or adding backyard cottages. This approach aims to address the housing mismatch where older individuals live in large, underused homes while others seek smaller, more affordable options. States like California are encouraging these efforts by easing regulations on accessory dwelling units, offering a less disruptive way to increase housing density.</p>

          <p>A Houthi missile successfully targeted Israel's main airport, exposing vulnerabilities in the country's air defenses and the limited effectiveness of US efforts to weaken the rebel group. The attack forced a brief shutdown of Ben Gurion Airport and prompted vows of retaliation from Prime Minister Netanyahu. Despite the presence of advanced missile defense systems, the Houthis continue to demonstrate their ability to strike distant targets. This incident raises questions about the ongoing security challenges in the region and the effectiveness of current strategies.</p>

          <p>A woman who disappeared from her home in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, in 1962 has been found alive and well after nearly 63 years. Audrey Backeberg, who was 20 years old at the time of her disappearance, was located living outside Wisconsin following a review of her case. The Sauk County Sheriff's Office confirmed that Ms. Backeberg's disappearance was her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play. The detective who solved the case credited an online ancestry account belonging to Ms. Backeberg's sister as crucial in helping locate her.</p>
