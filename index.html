        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated sharply as both nations exchanged missile strikes targeting air bases and military installations, each accusing the other of initiating the attacks. Pakistan claimed that India targeted its air bases with air-to-surface missiles, while India stated it struck Pakistani military targets in response to drone attacks. The New York Times article notes that the exchanges involved some of the heaviest military engagement since India conducted airstrikes on Pakistan earlier in the week, further exacerbating already strained relations following a deadly terrorist attack in India-controlled Kashmir. Despite calls for de-escalation, the crisis has intensified, prompting international concern and diplomatic efforts to mediate the situation.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the resurgence of silicosis, a deadly lung disease, due to the dismantling of federal protections under the Trump administration. It details how efforts to control silica exposure in mines, foundries, and construction sites have been undermined by firing key personnel and halting enforcement of safety standards. The article also points out the comeback of silicosis in the artificial-stone kitchen countertop industry, particularly among Latino immigrants. The author argues that the government's failure to prioritize public health and worker safety will lead to preventable illnesses and deaths.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines how employers are exploiting low-wage workers by offering too few hours, leading to financial instability and dependence on social safety nets. It explains that the Fair Labor Standards Act, designed to limit overwork, has been circumvented by hiring multiple part-time staff instead of full-time workers. The article highlights the use of just-in-time scheduling, which requires workers to be available at the last minute, making it difficult to hold down a second job. It concludes by proposing policy changes to address underwork, such as requiring employers to set schedules in advance and incentivizing full-time employment.</p>

The article explains that Mr. Xi has ramped up exports and deepened China’s position as the world’s leading base for manufacturing, in part by directing the state-controlled commercial banking system to lend an extra $2 trillion to industrial borrowers over the past four years. The article also explores the costs of this strategy, including strained relationships with trading partners and potential economic consequences for Chinese households, and how it is a clear challenge to the supremacy of the United States.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that European allies are struggling to provide Ukraine with necessary weapons as the U.S. reduces its support, leading Ukraine to seek revenue over natural resources. The article highlights that Europe is attempting to replace assistance lost from the United States, but lacks the capacity to do so quickly. It also explores concerns that Trump's policies may weaken European security, impacting their ability to aid Ukraine, and suggests that while European investments in weapons production are increasing, it will take time to ramp up production.</p>
