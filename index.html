          <p>The 78th Cannes Film Festival began with a dress code emphasizing modesty, reportedly surprising jury member Halle Berry, who had to alter her planned outfit. The festival also addresses concerns about President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on foreign films, with Cannes president Iris Knobloch expressing hope for global film industry cooperation. Robert De Niro received the Palme d'Or, presented by Leonardo DiCaprio, and used his acceptance speech to criticize President Trump as an "enemy of the arts." The festival opened with a salute to Ukraine and the premiere of Amélie Bonnin's French romance, 'Leave One Day'.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a bill with significant Medicaid cuts, despite internal party disagreements and opposition from Democrats. The bill proposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, stricter eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for organizations that provide abortion services. Demonstrators protesting the Medicaid cuts were arrested at the House Energy and Commerce Committee markup. The legislation also includes tax provisions, such as extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increasing the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, but faces pushback from moderate Republicans over state and local tax deductions. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured under the proposal.</p>

Ten acts qualified for the grand finale, including Sweden's KAJ, whose song is favored to win. Dion has stepped away from the limelight due to stiff-person syndrome. The semi-final featured performances from various countries, with some acts incorporating acrobatics and messages of hope. Five countries were eliminated from the competition.</p>

          <p>American Eagle's shares experienced a significant drop after the company withdrew its full-year guidance and announced a $75 million write-off of spring and summer merchandise. The company attributes this to slow sales, steep discounting, and economic uncertainty, expecting a 5% revenue decline in the first quarter. CEO Jay Schottenstein expressed disappointment with the company's execution and merchandising strategies, leading to higher promotions and excess inventory. The company is actively evaluating forward plans to strengthen product performance and improve buying principles, but macro uncertainty prompted the withdrawal of fiscal 2025 guidance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis indicates that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of a basic standard of living is widening. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) reports that a "minimal quality of life" is unattainable for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. In 2023, these households earned an average of $38,000 per year but needed $67,000 to afford essential items tracked by LISEP's index. From 2021 to 2023, the cost of basic economic security doubled, driven by surging housing and healthcare costs, while median earnings for lower-income Americans fell by 4% when adjusted for inflation.</p>

          <p>Senator Adam Schiff is requesting a Department of Defense Inspector General inquiry into the Trump administration's potential acceptance of a luxury jet from the Qatari government for use as Air Force One. Schiff, along with other Senate Democrats, raises constitutional, legal, and national security concerns about the gift. The senators are concerned that the administration is involving the DOD to legitimize the gift, placing the onus on the DOD to retrofit the plane at taxpayer expense, and ultimately transferring it to President Trump's library for personal use. The inquiry seeks details on the cost and timeline for retrofitting the plane, as well as any counterintelligence risks.</p>

The beetles are essential for cleaning delicate skeletons that are too fragile for human hands to handle. The colony, which originated in Africa in the 1930s, processes thousands of specimens, including birds and other small animals, with a soft, crackling sound permeating the room where they work.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. Manfred announced a change in league policy, stating that permanent ineligibility would end upon death, leading to the reinstatement of 17 players. Rose, banned in 1989 for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, can now be considered for induction. The Hall of Fame's board will consider their eligibility, though voters are also instructed to consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game."</p>

Douthat argues that successful politically themed art, whether right-wing or left-wing, captures aspects of reality that resonate even with those holding differing worldviews.

          <p>GD Culture Group, a struggling technology company with ties to China and reliance on TikTok, announced plans to invest up to $300 million in $TRUMP, the memecoin marketed by President Trump. This move has raised ethical concerns, as it could enrich the Trump family while the president negotiates with TikTok. The company's stock rose 12 percent after the announcement. Senator Christopher S. Murphy criticized the various sources of overseas money flowing into the Trump family business. The company says it wants to "enhance its balance sheet with high-performance, scalable digital assets."</p>

          <p>Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum will miss the remainder of the playoffs due to a torn Achilles tendon, impacting the team's chances of defending their NBA title. The injury also casts doubt on Tatum's availability for the next season. The Celtics face a difficult task to overcome a 3-1 series deficit against the New York Knicks without Tatum. The injury may also prompt the team to consider restructuring their high payroll, given luxury tax implications and Tatum's new contract. The article also references other athletes who have successfully returned from torn Achilles tendons.</p>

          <p>Older adults are being cautioned against receiving the Ixchiq vaccination for the chikungunya virus due to reports of fatal complications. The FDA and CDC recommend pausing the use of the vaccine in individuals over 60, following reports of serious adverse events, including neurologic and cardiac issues. Two of 17 reported events resulted in death due to severe complications, including encephalitis. The FDA warns that Ixchiq, which contains a live, weakened version of chikungunya, may cause symptoms similar to the virus. The agency plans to conduct an updated benefit-risk assessment for Ixchiq use in those over 60 years of age.</p>
