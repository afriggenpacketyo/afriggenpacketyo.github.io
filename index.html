          <p>The maternity fashion retailer Seraphine, famously worn by the Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration. The company, founded in 2002, faced significant trading challenges, including rising costs and fragile consumer confidence, leading to the majority of its 95 staff being made redundant. Interpath consultancy has been appointed as administrators and is exploring options for the business and its assets, including the brand itself. The company's website is now inaccessible after recently offering large discounts to clear stock.</p>

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. This move is seen as an attempt to pressure UK regulators and advance its stalled London listing, which has faced delays for over 18 months due to disagreements over risk disclosures related to its supply chain. The company has been scrutinized over alleged human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region and has also faced an EU investigation into its commercial practices. Shein's listing ambitions have shifted from New York to London and now potentially to Hong Kong amid ongoing regulatory hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in North Carolina have confirmed two deaths resulting from widespread flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal. One victim was an 83-year-old woman whose vehicle was swept away, and the other was a woman found after going missing during heavy rainfall. The storm, now a post-tropical cyclone, caused flash flooding across numerous counties, leading to dozens of water rescues and significant property damage in areas like Chapel Hill. The Haw River reached near-record levels, and a state of emergency was declared in Orange County.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void confidentiality clauses that seek to prevent workers from speaking out about such allegations. This legal change, championed by campaigners like former Harvey Weinstein assistant Zelda Perkins, aims to address the misuse of NDAs to cover up criminal behavior. The move brings the UK in line with countries like Ireland and the US, seeking to protect victims rather than powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has put forward a draft bill that would allow for the call-up of conscripts in specific security situations requiring a rapid military expansion. The plan is a compromise, developed in response to Russia's aggression in Europe, aiming to bolster the Bundeswehr to meet new NATO guidelines of 460,000 troops. The bill also seeks to make voluntary service more attractive with increased pay, hoping to double the number of reservists to 200,000. This move comes as Germany works to have a new military service scheme in place by 2026.</p>

The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations.

          <p>Dozens of Oasis fans were left "gutted" and out hundreds of pounds after being sold non-existent tickets for a corporate box at the band's Cardiff concert. Victims allege that a Pembrokeshire-based business owner, David Gray, took their money but failed to provide the promised tickets, with some groups paying over £1,000. Many victims trusted the seller due to previous legitimate dealings for other events. Dyfed-Powys Police are now investigating reports of the ticket scam after the seller failed to appear at the stadium and became unreachable on the day of the concert.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the 2024 Southport stabbing attack, where three young girls were murdered, has begun its first live hearings in Liverpool. The families of the victims have demanded "real change" to prevent similar tragedies. The inquiry, led by retired judge Sir Adrian Fulford, will first examine the circumstances leading to the attack by then 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, including his multiple contacts with the government's Prevent counter-extremism service. Rudakubana was sentenced to life in prison for the murders and ten counts of attempted murder in the random attack at a dance workshop.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is in the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit that combines royal pageantry with high-stakes political discussions. Key topics on the agenda with Prime Minister Keir Starmer include strengthening cooperation to stop small boat migrant crossings in the English Channel and advancing plans for a post-ceasefire security force for Ukraine. The visit, the first by an EU head of state since Brexit, symbolizes an effort to reset UK-France relations.

          <p>China has issued a stern warning to the Trump administration against restoring tariffs on its goods, threatening retaliation and cautioning other nations against striking deals with the U.S. that isolate China from supply chains. An official commentary in the People's Daily newspaper stated that dialogue is the only correct path but that China will firmly defend its interests if the U.S. proceeds with new levies after an August 12 deadline. The warning comes as the U.S. pressures trade partners to reach new agreements to avoid steep tariffs, with Vietnam recently securing a deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially delayed the imposition of widespread higher tariffs, extending the deadline for negotiations to August 1. The White House sent letters to 14 countries, including allies like Japan and South Korea, detailing the specific tariff rates they will face if new trade deals are not reached. President Trump indicated the new deadline was "firm, but not 100% firm," suggesting openness to further talks. The move provides a temporary reprieve from a potential trade war, but maintains pressure on nations to negotiate terms more favorable to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

The victims, ranging in age from 15 to 24, were part of a group of about 40 people at a gathering. The incident was part of a violent holiday weekend in the city, though officials noted that homicides and shootings are down year-over-year.</p>

The announcement followed calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia.

While the U.S. has historically been the top destination, industry insiders predict a rise in applications to Singaporean institutions from Chinese nationals.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly begun phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. While travelers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt, this change now applies to regular screening lines at select locations, including airports in Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia. The mandatory shoe-removal rule was implemented nationwide in 2006, several years after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 9-1 to the Milwaukee Brewers, marking their fourth consecutive defeat, after a catastrophic first inning from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto gave up five runs and was pulled from the game after recording only two outs, making it the shortest start of his MLB career. The inning was a combination of poor pitching, defensive errors, and a three-run home run by the Brewers' newly acquired Andrew Vaughn. The Dodgers' shorthanded lineup was unable to mount a comeback against Brewers' All-Star pitcher Freddy Peralta, managing only five hits in the game.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently curb "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the pretext of a substantial remodel to then charge higher rents. The council voted to amend a rule, now requiring landlords to obtain a Government Agency Order to vacate a unit for renovations, which is typically issued to address housing code violations. This makes it much harder to use a remodel as a "just cause" for eviction. The city is also developing rules for tenant relocation assistance and penalties for landlords who violate the new ordinance, aiming to protect renters.</p>
