          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine advisory committee, replacing them to restore public trust. Kennedy stated the goal is to ensure unbiased science, free from conflicts of interest, guides health agency recommendations. Critics, including health advocacy organizations, have pushed back, expressing concerns about undermining trust in vaccine science. Senator Bill Cassidy voiced fears that the new committee will be filled with individuals lacking vaccine expertise, potentially fueling the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses. The action follows Kennedy's recent announcements regarding COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and the resignation of a CDC official. The public must know that unbiased science guides the recommendations of our health agencies. The optimism score for this article is 25.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in conflict over the handling of immigration protests in Los Angeles, with Trump deploying National Guard members and criticizing Democratic leaders. Newsom has sued the Trump administration, claiming the federalization of the National Guard is illegal, and accuses the White House of exacerbating the situation for political gain. Trump said it would be a "great thing" if border czar Tom Homan arrested Newsom, to which Newsom responded that the comment is an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism." The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and Democratic-run states, particularly California, as Newsom builds a national profile amid speculation about a potential presidential run in 2028. Tensions have flared since Newsom approved $50 million for funds that could be used in legal battles against the federal government. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>
