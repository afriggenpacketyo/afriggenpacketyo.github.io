          <h2>Wayne Rooney Challenges Marcus Rashford's Blame of Inconsistent Environment for Performance</h2>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has publicly challenged Marcus Rashford's recent statement attributing his inconsistent performance at the club to an "inconsistent environment." Rooney, a legendary figure at United, argued that a player's ability to perform consistently is primarily a matter of individual application and effort, rather than solely the surrounding circumstances. While acknowledging that the environment at the club may not always have been ideal, he suggested that external factors can be an easy target for blame. Rashford, who scored 30 goals in a previous season but later fell out of favor, is now flourishing on loan at Barcelona, prompting this discussion about accountability.</p>

          <p>European Union heads of state are advocating for quicker action to utilize immobilized Russian assets, estimated at 175 billion euros, to address Ukraine's urgent financial and military needs for 2026-2027. This push comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. and ongoing discussions within the G7 regarding burden-sharing responsibilities. Some European nations, particularly Belgium which hosts the bulk of these assets at Euroclear, have expressed significant legal and financial concerns about further measures. The European Council is calling on the Commission to present concrete proposals soon, aiming to provide substantial support to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's UN ambassador, Samuel Moncada, has vehemently condemned a series of U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean, labeling them as "extrajudicial executions" targeting civilian vessels and calling for a UN Security Council investigation. Moncada reported at least five lethal attacks since September, resulting in 27 reported deaths, despite U.S. claims of targeting suspected drug traffickers. The family of victims from Trinidad and Tobago has demanded evidence from President Trump. Given the U.S. veto power, significant Security Council action beyond meetings is deemed unlikely, further escalating U.S.-Venezuelan tensions.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan is appealing his extradition from Australia to the United States, where he faces charges of illegally training Chinese military aviators over a decade ago. Duggan, who became an Australian citizen in 2012, denies the allegations, asserting they are politically motivated and that he is being unfairly targeted. His legal team argues that there were significant flaws in the extradition process, particularly since the alleged activities occurred in South Africa. His wife claims he is a "pawn in an ideological war" between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, is set to retire in December, significantly earlier than the typical tenure for his position. His departure comes amidst growing scrutiny and controversy surrounding the U.S. military's recent lethal strikes against alleged drug boats off Venezuela. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, from both parties, have expressed frustration and demanded more information regarding the legal justification and operational details of these attacks. Holsey's unexpected retirement adds a layer of complexity to the ongoing and contentious U.S. military operations in the Caribbean region.</p>

          <p>Analysts are warning that Japan's increasingly turbulent and fragmented political landscape poses a significant risk to its diplomatic commitments, potentially stalling progress in trilateral summits with China and South Korea. The current political environment suggests that no single party is likely to form a stable government, regardless of who assumes the prime ministership, with prospective leaders like Takaichi struggling to secure a majority. This inherent instability could severely undermine Japan's capacity to participate effectively in major diplomatic events and maintain momentum in critical regional frameworks, creating uncertainty for East Asian relations.</p>

The fee is activated once the parole grant is effective, not upon initial request, and will be collected by Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p>

          <p>A revolutionary long-acting injection for HIV prevention, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has received approval for use on the NHS in England and Wales, aligning with Scotland's existing policy. Administered six times a year, or every other month, this shot offers a discreet and convenient alternative to daily oral pills, which can be challenging for some individuals to adhere to. Experts express optimism that this "game-changing" treatment will significantly contribute to the UK's ambitious goal of eradicating new HIV cases by 2030, enhancing accessibility and efficacy of prevention methods.</p>

          <p>In a significant development, survivors have been reported for the first time following a U.S. military strike against a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean. This incident raises new questions regarding the provision of aid and potential custody of those involved, as previous strikes had no reported survivors. The Trump administration justifies these ongoing operations as a "war with narcoterrorist groups" from Venezuela, a stance that continues to draw scrutiny from legal experts and lawmakers over its adherence to international law. This event adds a new dimension to the contentious military actions.</p>

          <p>The article explores the evolving cultural landscape where discussing sweat has shed its taboo, exemplified by comedian Alan Carr's candidness on "The Celebrity Traitors." This shift reflects a broader trend of public figures, from actors to influencers, openly embracing bodily functions. The piece traces the historical shame linked to perspiration, fueled by early 20th-century hygiene marketing, contrasting it with contemporary "sweaty hot girl" aesthetics and the rising popularity of saunas for networking. Despite some commercialization, this trend signifies a move towards greater body positivity and openness.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court panel has refused to lift a lower court's order preventing President Trump from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois, deeming it a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment. The court found insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" against the U.S. government or that federal immigration officers were significantly impeded. Trump had sought the deployment for crime prevention in Chicago and to protect federal immigration facilities. However, the judges explicitly stated that "political opposition is not rebellion," maintaining the temporary restraining order until October 23.</p>

Approximately 300 evacuees are being transported to Anchorage, where emergency shelters have been established. This crisis underscores the immense challenges in remote regions and the extensive, long-term recovery efforts required, exacerbated by impending winter and past federal grant cuts for Indigenous communities.</p>

Emergency room visits for children aged 10 to 17 due to e-bike incidents have more than tripled since 2019, raising alarms among local officials like Montvale Mayor Mike Ghassali. Concerns primarily focus on the high speeds some e-bikes can reach, coupled with a lack of training, licensing, or insurance for young users.
