          <p>Chinese researchers are leading an effort to map the genetic diversity of Southeast Asian populations, which were largely overlooked by the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, is the result of a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams and includes genome sequencing for 3,023 cases from six countries, five language families, and 30 ethnic languages. The study has already revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry in the region, aiming to rectify the historical underrepresentation of mainland Southeast Asia in global genomic databases, where it previously contributed a mere 1.57 percent. This initiative underscores China's growing role in global scientific research and its commitment to documenting indigenous cultural and linguistic contexts while adhering to local ethical protocols. The effort involved extensive fieldwork in Southeast Asian rainforests to collect samples from diverse populations.</p>

          <p>Officials from Kyiv and Moscow are scheduled to meet in Istanbul to discuss ending the conflict that has been ongoing for more than three years. This marks the second round of talks held at the behest of the US President Donald Trump, with the first round resulting in a large-scale prisoner swap agreement and discussions on visions for a peace deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking a full ceasefire and the release of prisoners, while Russia has not shared its demands in advance but will present a "memorandum" of peace terms. Diplomatic advisors from Germany, France, and Britain are also expected to be present at the meeting, which follows Ukraine's recent attacks on Russian airbases.</p>

          <p>Eight people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, after a man shouting "free Palestine" threw Molotov cocktails at a gathering supporting Israeli hostages. The attack occurred at the Pearl Street Mall during a weekly demonstration organized by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israel group, and the FBI is investigating the incident as a suspected terror attack. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices during the attack. Witnesses reported a chaotic scene with smoke, people running, and injured individuals on the ground, prompting a swift response from law enforcement and condemnation from political figures. The victims, aged 52 to 88, sustained varying degrees of injuries, including burns, with one person in critical condition.</p>

          <p>A Chinese Harvard graduate's speech calling for unity in a divided world has sparked both praise and criticism in the United States and China. Jiang Yurong, the first Chinese woman to speak at a Harvard graduation ceremony, emphasized the value of international classrooms and a shared humanity, delivered her address shortly after the US vowed to "aggressively" revoke Chinese students' visas. Some conservative voices in the US have criticized Harvard for selecting Jiang, alleging her links to the Chinese Communist Party, while some Chinese social media users questioned her elite background. Despite the controversy, Jiang's message of unity resonated with many, with some expressing emotional support for her vision of a shared future.</p>

          <p>China refuted accusations from Washington that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, countering that the U.S. is undermining consensus and breaching deal terms. Tensions have risen following a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng, after which the Trump administration increased export restrictions on semiconductor design software and announced visa revocations for Chinese students. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson vowed that Beijing would take measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues actions that damage China, while also defending China's control over rare earths exports. The U.S. has continued to “unilaterally provoke new economic and trade frictions, increasing the uncertainty and instability in the bilateral economic and trade relations," the Chinese spokesperson said.

          <p>Despite an uncertain global economic outlook, the aviation industry is projected to improve in profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Revenue, operating profits, and net profits are expected to increase from 2024, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. The industry's net profit margin is forecast to rise to 3.7% in 2025, with total revenues projected to reach a record high of $979 billion. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the full year, although fleet expansion and modernization remain challenging due to supply chain issues in the aerospace sector. Jet fuel costs are anticipated to average $86 per barrel, translating into a $25 billion reduction in the total fuel bill compared to 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

Amber, a retriever cross rescued as a street puppy in Qatar, escaped from her foster family in the New Forest and is believed to have swam to the island before being rescued on her return. Despite regular sightings, Amber had entered a "wild mindset" until her rescue, and was eventually caught swimming back from Brownsea Island by two men in a boat.

The Mongolian-born 40-year-old, known as elder Miyagino, will leave the governing body amid uncertainty surrounding his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable has been closed since April 2024, after Miyagino's protege Hokuseiho was found to have physically abused two junior wrestlers, leading to the transfer of wrestlers and elders to the Isegahama stable. Hakuho, a winner of 45 elite-level championships and 1,187 matches, retired from competition in September 2021 and became a stablemaster the following July.</p>

With all votes counted, Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the vote, compared to Trzaskowski's 49.1%, marking a turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, while supporting traditional Catholic and family values and Polish sovereignty within the EU. Although the president's role is largely ceremonial, Nawrocki's victory is likely to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, giving them renewed hope for the 2027 parliamentary elections.</p>

          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic, with demand for maritime journeys surging due to pent-up wanderlust and new investments. Japanese ports are seeing record domestic passenger numbers, boosting local economies that rely on tourism. The Japanese cruise market grew significantly in 2024, increasing by 14.2 percent year-on-year to 224,100 passengers, with international visitors quadrupling to 1.4 million. Japanese shipping giants are developing cruise ships into thriving businesses to offset losses from cargo business, with new ships being launched and business alliances being formed.</p>
