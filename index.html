          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime has secured a spot in the US Open quarter-finals for the first time since 2021 after a decisive victory over Andrey Rublev. The 25th seed won in straight sets, 7-5 6-3 6-4, overpowering his opponent with 42 winners despite having lost most of their previous encounters. Auger-Aliassime expressed that this return to the quarter-finals feels more deserved after overcoming recent injuries and struggles with confidence. He will now face Australia's Alex de Minaur, the eighth seed, in the next round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to release data that justifies the success of their COVID-19 drugs, stating he wants an answer "NOW." His comments follow the FDA's decision to limit the latest vaccines to high-risk individuals and a major leadership shakeup at the CDC, including the firing of its director. Trump mentioned seeing "extraordinary" information from Pfizer but questioned why it hasn't been made public, urging transparency to clear up the public and governmental conflict over vaccine efficacy. This comes as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues his overhaul of federal health agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has decreased by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year. This decline coincides with the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, which have slowed the flow of both legal and illegal immigration. Economists express concern that this reduction could create labor shortages in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, where immigrants constitute a significant portion of the workforce. The slowdown may also complicate economic signals for the Federal Reserve as it assesses the labor market's health.</p>

          <p>A group of nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have co-authored an op-ed accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of jeopardizing Americans' health. Their public condemnation follows the recent ousting of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and what they describe as an agenda to dismantle the nation's vaccine system. The former leaders, whose tenures span both Republican and Democratic administrations, cited Kennedy's mass firings, promotion of unproven treatments, and cancellation of mRNA vaccine research as deeply alarming actions.

          <p>Authorities in Nevada have initiated a homicide investigation after a man was found dead in a pool of blood at the annual Burning Man festival. The discovery was made on Saturday evening around the same time the event's signature effigy was set ablaze. The Pershing County Sheriff's Office confirmed the victim was a white adult male who was "obviously deceased" when found, though his identity has not yet been released. Organizers of the festival stated they are fully cooperating with law enforcement and have advised attendees to remain vigilant, acknowledging the complexity of investigating a crime in a temporary city that will soon disappear.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed to a deal to sign England center-back Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, pending final clearance from the selling club. The 25-year-old defender completed a medical in London after the clubs compromised on a transfer fee, which was initially proposed at £35 million plus a sell-on clause. However, Crystal Palace is delaying the final sanction of the transfer until they secure a suitable replacement, having already signed one new center-back. Guehi's signing is part of a record-breaking summer spending spree for Liverpool, aimed at strengthening their defense after a shaky start to the season.</p>

Both hikers were airlifted to a hospital, but the man succumbed to his injuries before surgery; his wife is in stable condition.

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebel group has detained at least 11 United Nations personnel after raiding UN offices in the capital, Sanaa. The detentions are viewed as part of a broader security crackdown following a recent Israeli airstrike that killed the Houthi government's prime minister and other officials. The UN has strongly condemned the arbitrary detentions and demanded the immediate and unconditional release of its staff. Analysts suggest that targeting aid workers has become a recurring Houthi tactic to consolidate power, exert leverage, and respond to external security pressures, reflecting a deep paranoia about foreign infiltration within their ranks.</p>

Researchers analyzed over 225,000 animal bones from southern France spanning 8,000 years. They found that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domesticated species such as cattle and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding for agricultural purposes. The findings underscore the deep and lasting impact of human activities on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The passionate fan base for the hit Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has become increasingly hostile, prompting the network to launch a campaign for kindness online. The show's central love triangle has created intense rivalries, with some viewers directing threats and harassment towards the actors. A board-certified psychiatrist suggests this behavior points to a blurring line between fiction and reality, possibly stemming from a societal void and a longing for connection. She identifies this as a sign of parasocial relationships, or one-sided bonds with media figures, which can be amplified by the anonymity of social media.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is legally challenging a decision by World Boxing that mandates she undergo gender testing to remain eligible for competition. The federation's ruling came after Khelif's gold medal win at the 2024 Paris Olympics sparked controversy and debate. Khelif has filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), seeking to overturn the mandate and be declared eligible for the upcoming World Boxing Championships without a test. CAS has dismissed her initial request to suspend the testing requirement while the case is being heard, leaving her participation in the championships uncertain.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian authorities have arrested a suspect in the assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a former speaker of parliament, and claim there is a "Russian trace" in the crime. Parubiy, a key figure in Ukraine's pro-Western movements, was shot and killed in the city of Lviv. Police stated the suspect, who was disguised as a courier, had carefully planned the attack by studying the politician's movements. Since Russia's full-scale invasion, both nations have accused each other of carrying out assassinations of political and military figures, and this killing has further escalated tensions and accusations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, reinforcing their countries' strong ties. The meeting is particularly significant as it follows the imposition of steep U.S. tariffs on India in retaliation for its continued purchases of discounted Russian oil. Both leaders hailed their "special and privileged" partnership, with Putin planning a visit to India later this year. Analysts suggest that pressure from Washington is pushing New Delhi to align more closely with both Russia and China to counter what it views as U.S. economic unilateralism.</p>

          <p>The iconic American apparel company Levi's has warned that rising anti-American sentiment, which it links to President Trump's tariffs and governmental policies, could negatively impact its sales in the United Kingdom. In its UK financial accounts, the company listed the risk that British consumers might increasingly prefer national or European brands over American ones. While Levi's reported a rise in UK sales and profits, this statement marks one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly expressing fears about the commercial consequences of the current administration's foreign and trade policies. This concern reflects a broader trend seen in other countries like Canada.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the publicly-owned rail operator in Scotland, has officially scrapped peak-time ticket prices, allowing passengers to travel at cheaper, off-peak rates throughout the day. The move is a response to post-pandemic travel patterns, as commuting habits have changed and rush-hour trains are less crowded than before. This initiative has raised questions about whether the rest of the U.K. might adopt a similar model to make train travel more affordable. While passengers welcome the lower fares, experts are divided, with some warning that it could lead to overcrowding on certain routes or potentially higher overall prices if passenger numbers do not increase significantly.</p>

Trump argues that these taxes and regulations unfairly target American tech giants like Google and Amazon, demanding they be scrapped immediately. The threat has caught EU policymakers by surprise, coming just weeks after a deal was reached to cap transatlantic tariffs.

          <p>David Warburton, who served as the Member of Parliament for Somerton and Frome until 2023, has died suddenly in London at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious after he was found by paramedics at a residence in Chelsea. Warburton was suspended from the Conservative Party in 2022 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied and were later withdrawn. He ultimately resigned his seat in June 2023 after admitting to cocaine use, triggering a by-election for his constituency. Colleagues remembered him as a talented and passionate defender of his constituents.</p>

          <p>India's strategic decision to continue purchasing discounted Russian crude oil is reshaping global energy dynamics and testing the limits of Western sanctions against Moscow. This defiance provides India with cheap energy to fuel its economic growth but leaves it vulnerable to accusations of undermining the international effort to isolate Russia. For the U.S. and its allies, this presents a difficult dilemma: escalating pressure on India could cause a surge in global oil prices, while backing down could weaken the sanctions regime. The situation highlights how energy has become a key currency of global power, with market balances now heavily influenced by geopolitical rivalry.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the country's trading partners by declaring national emergencies. The court found that the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the duties was likely not intended by Congress. While the ruling is a significant legal setback for one of Trump's signature economic policies, the court has allowed the tariffs to remain in effect temporarily to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. Trump has vowed to take the fight to the nation's highest court.</p>
