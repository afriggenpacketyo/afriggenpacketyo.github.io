          <p>Fruitist, formerly Agrovision, a berry startup backed by Ray Dalio's family office, has exceeded $400 million in annual sales, driven by the popularity of its jumbo blueberries. The company differentiates itself through a vertically integrated supply chain, ensuring consistent quality and longer shelf life by growing berries in microclimates across Oregon, Morocco, Romania, and Mexico. CEO Steve Magami emphasizes the company's mission to solve the problem of inconsistent berry quality found in grocery stores by investing heavily in infrastructure and machine learning. Fruitist plans to expand into cherries and has invested over $600 million to establish a global presence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida's public universities are facing scrutiny for their formal cooperation agreements with ICE, granting campus police immigration enforcement powers. Journalist Josh Moody's expos√© reveals that these agreements allow universities to question, arrest, and prepare charges for individuals suspected of immigration violations, acting as 'force multipliers' for ICE. This collaboration contrasts with elite Northeastern universities that have largely fought deportation efforts, raising concerns about academic freedom and the control of universities by state officials. Students have protested these agreements, viewing them as part of a broader effort to control universities and minimize certain disciplines deemed liberal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating increasing tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations regarding higher levies imposed by Washington. The proposal suggests raising the import amount from the United States to approximately 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons. This consideration arises amidst growing calls within Japan for more affordable imported rice, as prices continue to surge, partly due to a supply shortage. Economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa is expected to hold a second round of talks with the United States later this month.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have triggered economic anxiety in the US, with consumer confidence plummeting and businesses predicting a slowdown in production. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index has dropped to levels lower than during the Great Recession. Consumers are panic-buying products likely to see price hikes, while American manufacturing has slowed, contradicting Trump's goal of reviving domestic production. Economists warn that these trends could negatively impact the US economy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is experiencing increased infighting and backstabbing among his allies due to various controversies, including those related to trade, national security, and personal loyalty. The Pentagon is facing turmoil, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth under scrutiny for sharing sensitive information outside of classified channels. This discord reflects Trump's turbulent management style and could lead to more turmoil as he pursues significant policy changes.</p>

          <p>Japan is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. The proposal involves increasing the amount of tariff-free U.S. rice imports to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons. This move comes as Japan seeks to secure exemption from U.S. tariffs and address growing domestic demand for more affordable rice amidst rising prices. The decision reflects a need to balance trade interests with domestic agricultural concerns.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making. The lawsuit challenges the administration's threat to review $9 billion in federal funding after Harvard refused to comply with demands to appoint an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. Harvard aims to halt a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants, arguing that no government should dictate what private universities can teach or whom they can admit and hire.

          <p>A decrease in air travel to the U.S., driven by President Donald Trump's tariffs and anti-immigration policies, is posing a risk to Walt Disney's theme park business. International guests account for a significant portion of Disney's park attendance, and declining foreign arrivals could negatively impact the company's operating income. Additionally, increased competition from Universal's new theme park, Epic Universe, could further challenge Disney's market share. However, Disney's cruise business is expected to provide a boost to profits, offsetting some of the weakness in theme parks. (not investment advice)</p>
