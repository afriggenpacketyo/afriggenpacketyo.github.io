          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul, following calls from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. The European leaders, including representatives from the UK, France, Germany, and Poland, visited Kyiv and threatened Russia with further sanctions on its energy and banking sectors if a ceasefire was not agreed upon. Putin stated that Russia is open to serious negotiations without preconditions, aiming to achieve a lasting peace, while not directly responding to the ceasefire demand. Kyiv has not yet responded to Putin's invitation, and the proposed talks would potentially resume discussions held in Istanbul three years prior.</p>

          <p>Several British newspapers are leading with stories on the government's new immigration plans, which aim to deport migrants who commit crimes and prevent lawyers from abusing human rights laws to block deportations. The Observer features a photograph of the Trump family and reports on potential corruption within the Trump organization. Other headlines include Danny Dyer's revelations about his drug use during his time on EastEnders, speculation about the cast of the next series of Strictly Come Dancing, and the arrest of a retired policeman for a social media post.

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions arising from the trade war. The talks have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. While Mr. Trump hailed the initial conversations as a success and suggested lowering tariffs to 80 percent if China makes concessions, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal. The Trump administration seeks to address unfair subsidization and fentanyl precursor exports, while China remains firm on not making trade concessions in response to tariffs.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect mothering is harmful and unrealistic. She suggests that being flawed is essential for children to learn to accept their own imperfections and that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems by the field of psychiatry. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are already good enough, highlighting the importance of give and take in relationships and the value of exposing children to flaws.</p>

Kim thanked his supporters and pledged to work towards the nation's happiness, while Han accepted the outcome.

          <p>Facing the potential of new sanctions, President Vladimir V. Putin has called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia to occur in the coming days. This proposal comes after leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland jointly visited Ukraine and warned Russia of significant sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if a full ceasefire isn't agreed upon. Putin suggested a meeting in Istanbul on May 15, emphasizing the elimination of conflict root causes, while Ukraine has yet to respond. The European effort is coordinated with the White House, though past attempts to establish a ceasefire have been unsuccessful due to disagreements on conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has drawn widespread condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum. The proposal, which surfaced ahead of a trip to the Middle East, has been viewed as an affront to Iranian national and cultural identity. The Persian Gulf has been known by that name since at least 550 B.C., and Iranians consider it a symbol of their nationhood. Trump's idea has sparked unity among Iranians, who are often divided on other issues, and has been criticized by both government officials and opposition figures.</p>

European Union standards, particularly regarding food, health, and safety, are considered non-negotiable, with concerns over hormone-raised beef and chemically treated chicken. While the U.S. argues its meat production is superior, Europeans prioritize hormone-free, grass-fed products and maintain a robust network of smaller family farms, supported by subsidies and trade restrictions.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that the United States and China made "great progress" in high-level trade talks held in Geneva. The discussions marked the first face-to-face meeting between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent. Trump expressed a desire to see China open up to American business for the benefit of both countries. The talks aim to resolve the trade war, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs and restricted exports, impacting the global economy. White House officials clarified that any reduction in tariffs would require concessions from China.</p>

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is moving to Canada due to the impact of tariffs and strained relations between the U.S. and Canada. The museum, located in a U.S. town accessible only through Canada, has seen a significant drop in Canadian visitors since President Trump imposed tariffs and discussed annexing Canada. The owners, Neil and Krystal King, are relocating the museum across the border to avoid tariffs on their Chinese-made ducks and escape the uncertainty of international diplomacy. The move highlights the economic consequences of trade tensions on small businesses in border communities.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise in treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option, intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, while potentially having fewer adverse side effects. The study, conducted across 82 sites worldwide, included a diverse patient population, with a majority from Asian countries. The findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest that zongertinib could become a new benchmark for targeted therapy in this difficult-to-treat form of lung cancer.</p>

Despite ongoing trade tensions, the company is targeting a doubling of its overseas revenue to 100 billion yuan within three years, driven by strong demand in developing countries. Sany will focus on building localized marketing channels rather than constructing new factories.

          <p>Following Vice President Vance's initial comments dismissing the India-Pakistan conflict, the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear escalation. Intense fighting, including missile strikes on key military installations, prompted U.S. officials to intervene, with Vance and Rubio engaging directly with leaders from both countries. The U.S. expressed concerns about a potential full-scale war and facilitated a cease-fire agreement, though reports of continued cross-border firing persisted. Pakistan credited U.S. involvement, while India did not acknowledge it, highlighting the delicate diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict.</p>
