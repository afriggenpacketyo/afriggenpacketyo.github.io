          <p>A former executive has filed a lawsuit against Verily, Alphabet's health tech subsidiary, alleging the company improperly used the health data of over 25,000 patients and concealed these HIPAA violations. The whistleblower, Ryan Sloan, claims he was fired after reporting the breaches, which involved using protected information in marketing and research without consent. The lawsuit asserts that Verily's internal investigation confirmed the violations but the company chose not to notify affected clients, which include major corporations like Walgreens and Delta Air Lines.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in prison for her role in a federal bribery case. She was convicted of accepting bribes including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for political influence. Her defense had requested a lighter sentence due to her ongoing cancer treatment, but the judge cited her as a central participant in the scheme. During her statement, she expressed remorse and claimed her husband had put her in an illegal position.</p>

          <p>The federal trial of Ryan Routh, who is accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump in September 2024, has begun in Florida. Prosecutors allege Routh planned a "textbook ambush" with a rifle at Trump's golf club, coming within seconds of succeeding before a Secret Service agent intervened. Routh, who is representing himself, delivered a rambling opening statement that was cut short by the judge for being irrelevant. The first witness, a Secret Service agent, described discovering Routh aiming a rifle through a fence.</p>

          <p>The public assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is a stark and horrifying symbol of America's descent into political violence. The article reflects on how such an event, broadcast graphically online, forces a confrontation with the real-world consequences of dehumanizing rhetoric. It contextualizes Kirk's murder alongside other recent violent acts, arguing that a culture celebrating or remaining silent on violence against political opponents has eroded basic norms of decency. The author suggests this moment of shock could be a turning point, but warns that emotional overload can also lead to dangerous political realignments.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist murdered at age 31, rose to prominence as a highly effective organizer and debater who championed the nativist themes of the modern Republican party.

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, prominent right-wing figures like Alex Jones and Steve Bannon have framed the event as an act of war against conservatives. Without knowing the shooter's motive, many have quickly blamed the political left, using combative rhetoric and calling for supporters to unite against what they describe as "demonic forces." This reaction highlights the deep polarization and tendency to interpret acts of violence through a partisan lens, with President Trump also blaming the "radical left" for creating a climate of hate.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is the latest in a string of politically motivated violent acts that have occurred across the political spectrum in recent months. This event has intensified the conversation around political volatility in America, where heightened profiles often lead to increased threats. While Kirk was a provocative figure, leaders from both parties have condemned the violence. Polling shows that while most Americans desire civility, many also feel their core values are under attack, creating a fertile environment for radicalization and violence.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened further attacks on Hamas leaders in Qatar if the nation does not expel them, escalating tensions with the key U.S. ally. The warning came after an Israeli strike in Doha killed several Hamas members. President Trump stated he had spoken with both leaders and assured Qatar that such an attack "will not happen again," emphasizing that unilaterally bombing a sovereign ally does not advance U.S. or Israeli goals. The strike has been condemned by Qatar and has complicated ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has unveiled his administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) strategy, a 20-page document with 128 recommendations aimed at tackling chronic disease. While the initiative has successfully pressured food companies and spurred state-level policies, the new report is more of a to-do list than a concrete plan. Critics point out that while it calls for research into environmental factors and vaccine injuries, it lacks clear strategies for action once that research is complete, raising questions about how its ambitious goals will be measured and achieved.</p>

          <p>A new study projects that the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance could lead to a dramatic increase in tuberculosis cases and deaths worldwide. Researchers estimate that in a worst-case scenario, an additional 10 million people could contract TB and 2.2 million could die by 2030. The U.S. is the primary funder for TB control programs in many high-burden countries, supporting everything from screening to treatment. The abrupt cuts have already stalled vital programs and are expected to have a lasting negative impact, even if funding is eventually restored.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medicare's "3-day rule" is a critical regulation that can significantly affect out-of-pocket healthcare costs for seniors. The rule requires a beneficiary to have a medically necessary inpatient hospital stay of at least three consecutive days before Medicare Part A will cover subsequent care in a skilled nursing facility. Time spent under "observation status" does not count, which can lead to unexpected bills for patients who believe they qualify. Understanding this rule, along with its exemptions through plans like Medicare Advantage, is essential for navigating post-hospital care coverage.</p>

The comments drew immediate backlash, prompting an apology from MSNBC's president for being "inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable."

          <p>An excerpt from former Vice President Kamala Harris's forthcoming memoir has reopened the Democratic Party's internal debate about President Joe Biden's decision to seek reelection in 2024. In the book, Harris describes the choice as reckless and questions why it was left to an individual's ego rather than a broader strategic consideration. The excerpt has revived discussions about Biden's age and fitness to run, with some Democrats viewing Harris's account as a necessary part of processing the loss, while others worry it reopens a painful wound for the party.</p>
