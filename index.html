Despite being sacked 565 times, Brady managed to avoid serious injuries for most of his career, with a notable exception in 2008 when he tore his ACL after a hit by Bernard Pollard.

          <p>For Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, the news of a trade agreement with the United States is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. According to the New York Times article, the agreement, the first of its kind since Trump imposed tariffs on trading partners, is seen as a testament to the "special relationship" between the two countries. Starmer's efforts to build a relationship with Trump, including delivering an invitation from King Charles III, have positioned Britain favorably in trade negotiations. The deal could boost Britain's economy but may also present challenges in its relationship with the European Union.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade agreements could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to finalize deals before a 90-day pause on tariffs expires in July. CBS News reports that the U.S. is in negotiation mode with several countries, including the UK, Canada, Italy, India, and Japan. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates deals being mostly wrapped up by year-end, experts suggest negotiations may extend into June. The administration's overtures aim to alleviate economic uncertainty caused by tariffs, although China remains largely absent from current trade talks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a "fool" after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady due to economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. According to CNBC, Trump expressed his frustration on Truth Social, arguing that Powell doesn't have a clue and that low inflation justifies lower rates. The Fed, however, stated that it would keep rates unchanged until the economic outlook becomes clearer, citing rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation. Powell has maintained that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. sanctions on two small Chinese refiners for buying Iranian oil have created difficulties in receiving crude and led them to sell products under different names. Reuters reports that the sanctions have deterred other independent Chinese refiners from purchasing Iranian crude, leading to a halt in purchases by about five plants in Shandong province. State-run Shandong Port Group has denied entry to vessels carrying crude for the sanctioned refineries, and large state banks have stopped providing operational capital. China opposes unilateral sanctions and defends its trade with Iran as legitimate.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article assesses the impact of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, on federal spending. Despite initial promises of significant budget cuts, DOGE's verified savings amount to only a small fraction of federal spending. The article notes that while DOGE has targeted areas such as public health and foreign aid, the largest expenses, including Social Security and Medicare, remain untouched. Additionally, some cost-cutting measures may lead to long-term budget deficits due to reduced IRS enforcement and increased legal fees.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, a Los Angeles holistic medicine doctor and wellness influencer, is raising concerns due to her views on vaccines and alignment with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s mission. The Los Angeles Times reports that Means, a Stanford medical school graduate, has publicly questioned CDC guidelines on hepatitis B vaccines for newborns. While some believe she could bring a different perspective to the U.S. government by focusing on food as medicine, others are concerned about her views on vaccines.</p>

          <p>Hospital mental health units are struggling to stay afloat due to low Medicaid payments, and federal cuts could worsen the situation. NPR reports that Medicaid covers a large share of mental health patients, and spending cuts could accelerate psychiatric unit closures. Spencer Hospital in Iowa, for example, loses $2 million per year on its psychiatric unit, but the CEO vows to keep it open. Experts worry that cuts to Medicaid will leave more people without insurance, delaying treatment and leading to more crises.</p>

While the Israeli military declined to confirm the identity, two officials confirmed the documentary’s conclusions to The Times.

The report notes that detectives found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious. Power was restored to Heathrow's terminals hours before flights resumed, but the airport's management has been criticized for the decision to close the airport and the long shutdown that followed.</p>
