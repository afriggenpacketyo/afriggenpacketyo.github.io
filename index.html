          <p>Aerospace firm Firefly Aerospace experienced a robust market debut, with its stock opening at $70 per share on the Nasdaq, significantly above its initial pricing range. This opening values the company at nearly $10 billion, reflecting growing investor interest in the space technology sector. The company, known for its Alpha rocket and Blue Ghost lunar lander, has secured major contracts with NASA and defense contractors, though it continues to report a net loss despite a sixfold increase in quarterly revenue.</p>

          <p>Several high-ranking FBI officials, including former acting director Brian Driscoll, have been ousted from their positions without any provided reason, according to sources. The terminations have raised concerns among rank-and-file agents about potential political motivations, as some of the officials were involved in investigations related to former President Donald Trump. Driscoll had previously resisted a directive to compile a list of agents involved in the Jan. 6 investigation, an act described by a Trump ally as "insubordination."

          <p>The 23rd annual Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival is highlighted as a crucial and welcoming space for Black filmmakers to showcase ambitious projects. The event features prominent figures like Michelle Obama and Spike Lee, alongside screenings of diverse works, from a Slick Rick visual album to a Viola Davis-narrated documentary on Black infant mortality. The festival fosters a supportive environment where artists can present authentic Black narratives, a particularly important role amid industry pushback against diversity initiatives. This creates a unique connection between the creators and an appreciative audience.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing all further construction on an immigrant detention center in Florida's Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling follows testimony regarding the project's environmental impact on the sensitive ecosystem, which is home to endangered species and considered sacred by the Miccosukee Tribe. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day halt on construction was granted to prevent potential irreparable harm. Environmental groups and the tribe argued that the necessary impact studies were never conducted before the project began.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson's office has concluded its investigation into the Chicago Police Department's presence at a June ICE operation that sparked controversy. The probe, led by the Deputy Mayor for Immigrant Rights, resulted in recommendations to empower the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) to investigate potential violations of the city's "Welcoming City Ordinance." Police maintained they were present only to ensure public safety during protests against the raid, which saw ten individuals detained by federal agents. The incident has intensified scrutiny of the mayor's handling of immigration issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies that debt collectors can legally freeze a person's bank account, but only after obtaining a court judgment against them. This legal process requires filing a lawsuit and winning the case, a situation many consumers inadvertently enable by ignoring court summonses. However, certain funds, such as Social Security benefits, disability payments, and veterans' benefits, are federally protected from garnishment. Even after a freeze occurs, individuals have options, including filing exemption claims with the court or negotiating payment plans directly with the collector.</p>

The company's net income more than doubled to $819.5 million, driven by its AI-powered advertising technology.

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), has requested a nearly $10 billion electricity rate hike over the next four years, a proposal environmental advocates claim would be the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the increases are necessary to ensure grid reliability, diversify energy sources, and cover the costs of new solar and battery storage facilities. However, watchdog groups contend the hike would place a significant financial burden on vulnerable residents and disproportionately benefit FPL shareholders.

The statement was made as new, sweeping U.S. tariffs on imports from approximately 90 other countries came into effect. The ongoing trade conflict has seen the U.S. and China impose escalating tariffs on each other's goods since the measures were first announced in April.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old Santa Barbara man, David Genovese, has been sentenced to more than six years in prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of animal cruelty. Prosecutors revealed that Genovese had a pattern of adopting cats from local shelters with the express purpose of torturing and killing them. The investigation began after a cat adopted that same day was found in his vehicle with its paws bound and suffering from severe head trauma. Authorities later discovered other deceased animals linked to Genovese, who had also stolen kittens from a shelter.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel intends to take control of the entire Gaza Strip to ensure its security and remove Hamas from power. In a Fox News interview, he clarified that Israel does not want to permanently govern the territory. Instead, he stated the goal is to "hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly" and provide a good life for Gazans. This announcement comes as Israel's Security Cabinet is expected to discuss plans for an expanded military operation in Gaza, a move likely to face strong international opposition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This move would reverse the long-standing practice of counting all residents, regardless of citizenship status, as mandated by the Constitution's Enumeration Clause. The Trump administration's previous attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was blocked by the Supreme Court, though the door was left open for future attempts. This new directive sets up another major legal and political battle over the decennial count.</p>

The "one in, one out" deal allows the UK to return a migrant who arrives illegally in exchange for accepting an approved asylum seeker from France. The first detentions occurred on the day the scheme came into force, with the Home Secretary stating those held could be returned within weeks. The Labour government says the program is a key part of its strategy to secure the borders, while the Conservative opposition argues it is an insufficient deterrent compared to their previous Rwanda plan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of having conflicts of interest due to alleged investments in Chinese military-linked companies. This unusual presidential intervention follows concerns raised by Republican Senator Tom Cotton about Tan's suitability to lead a company receiving billions in U.S. government subsidies for domestic chip manufacturing. Intel, which has defended its CEO's commitment to U.S. national security, saw its shares fall after Trump's social media post. The attack adds pressure on the tech giant as it navigates a strategic turnaround.</p>

This May, a boot containing a human foot was discovered on the lake's shore, and investigators determined the shoe was manufactured just before his disappearance.

The president is struggling to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, with deadlines for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire and new global tariffs arriving amid signs of economic weakness. Simultaneously, he faces rare defiance from some Republican lawmakers over his signature legislative bill and his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The confluence of these issues has reportedly darkened the mood in the White House and presents a major test for the remainder of his term.</p>
