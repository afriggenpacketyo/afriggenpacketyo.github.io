            <p>Serena Williams has voiced concerns over perceived disparities in anti-doping enforcement, suggesting that she would have faced harsher penalties than Jannik Sinner for a similar offense. Sinner, currently serving a three-month ban, tested positive for a banned substance last year. Williams claimed she was unfairly targeted with frequent drug tests during her career. Williams emphasized her respect for Sinner but highlighted the perceived double standard in anti-doping regulations.</p>

            <p>The Kremlin plans to use Glavprodukt, an American-owned company seized by the state, to supply food to the Russian army, potentially straining relations with the U.S. The company was seized from Los Angeles-based Leonid Smirnov and is now under the control of Russiaâs federal property management agency. Glavprodukt's new management intends to ensure stable production for the national guard and defense ministry. Smirnov denies wrongdoing and calls the lawsuit a "Russian-style corporate raid".</p>

While a limited trade agreement may be tactically beneficial, it is not the key to unlocking UK prosperity, especially compared to improved trade relations with Europe.
