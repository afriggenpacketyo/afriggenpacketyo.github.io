          <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary commuter rail system for the San Francisco Bay Area, experienced a complete shutdown of all train services for several hours on Friday morning due to a computer networking problem.

The incident occurred as BART struggles to regain ridership following the Covid-19 pandemic, with current passenger traffic remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels.

          <p>Indiana's governor has signed a groundbreaking bill that could strip charity hospitals of their non-profit status if they continue to charge excessive prices. This legislation, the first of its kind in the U.S., follows an investigation into high hospital prices in the state. The law requires the state to establish a price benchmark, giving hospitals until 2029 to lower their prices. Supporters hope this will reduce healthcare costs for individuals and businesses, while the Indiana Hospital Association expresses concerns about the potential impact on financial stability.</p>

This internal conflict, coupled with debates over Medicaid cuts, could determine the fate of the entire Republican legislative agenda, as any changes to the SALT cap would be expensive and challenge the party's budget for tax cuts.</p>
