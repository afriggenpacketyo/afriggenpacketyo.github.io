          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, largely driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment. However, the company saw a 1% decline in global unit case volume, indicating weaker consumer demand in markets like North America and Latin America. Despite these mixed results, the company narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast to the upper end of its previous range. The report also confirmed plans to launch a cane sugar version of its classic soda in the U.S. this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man, Howard Phillips, has been found guilty of attempting to spy for what he believed were Russian intelligence agents. Phillips intended to pass personal information about former UK defense secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he thought were Russian operatives named Sasha and Dima. In reality, they were undercover British intelligence officers. The court heard that Phillips, who was described by his ex-wife as being infatuated with espionage, had also applied for a job with the UK Border Force as part of his plan to assist Russia.</p>

          <h2>UK Rental Costs Have Increased by an Average of £221 Per Month Over Three Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:05:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has risen by 21%, or £221, over the past three years. The sharp increase is attributed to high demand from tenants coupled with an insufficient supply of available rental properties. This surge in rental costs is forcing some individuals to turn down job opportunities or relocate, with some young adults relying on financial help from their parents. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, affordability remains a significant challenge for many renters across the country.</p>

          <p>The United States and Taiwan are evaluating a potential collaboration on a spaceport for suborbital flights, which could drastically reduce travel times. According to the American Institute in Taiwan, this partnership could shorten the journey between Taipei and Houston to as little as two and a half hours, a significant decrease from the current 14.5-hour direct flight. The proposed cooperation would focus on suborbital transport, an emerging technology where vehicles briefly exit the Earth's atmosphere before landing. This technology is still in the experimental phase but holds promise for revolutionizing long-distance travel and ultra-fast cargo delivery.</p>

Up to $140 million for the Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program, which funds state and local surveillance and prevention strategies, is reportedly being withheld. This program has been crucial for tracking changes in the drug supply and implementing life-saving interventions, contributing to the first decline in U.S. overdose deaths in 2023.

Analysts attribute Jiangsu's resilience to its diversified industrial structure, lower dependence on real estate, and reduced reliance on exports compared to Guangdong.

          <h2>The Case for Shade as Essential Public Health Infrastructure in a Warming World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global temperatures rise and heat waves become more intense, shade is emerging as a critical and democratic tool for public health. The article argues that what clean air and water were to the 20th century, shade infrastructure could be for the 21st. Trees are the most effective solution, as they not only block sunlight but also cool the air through transpiration, making urban environments more livable and reducing heat-related deaths. Where trees are not viable, cities must invest in artificial shade structures like canopies and sails, recognizing that providing shade is a fundamental necessity for adapting to a hotter planet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is engaging in a pattern of undermining state-level democratic decisions that conflict with its political agenda, turning the principle of federalism upside down. A notable example is the recent maneuver in Texas, where the administration collaborated with the state's Attorney General to have a court nullify a bipartisan state law providing financial aid to 'Dreamers'. This action bypassed the will of the Texas legislature. This pattern extends to other states like California and Maine, where the federal government has interfered with state policies on issues ranging from law enforcement to transgender rights, using federal power to subvert rather than protect established laws.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria have created a clear point of friction between the Trump and Netanyahu governments, revealing a divergence in their regional strategies. The strikes targeted Syrian forces that had entered the southern Sweida province, an action Israel undertook to protect the local Druze community and maintain a buffer zone. However, this intervention complicates the Trump administration's efforts to normalize relations with Syria's new government. U.S. officials have expressed frustration, with one describing the Israeli actions as undermining American diplomatic goals and another labeling the strikes as "poorly timed."</p>

          <p>Despite the high effectiveness of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) in preventing HIV, a significant portion of at-risk Americans are not using the medication, often due to a lack of awareness. PrEP is about 99% effective when taken as prescribed, yet only about one-third of the 1.2 million people who could benefit from it are on the drug. Stark racial and gender disparities exist in its uptake; while 94% of at-risk white individuals use PrEP, less than 13% of Black people and 15% of women do.
