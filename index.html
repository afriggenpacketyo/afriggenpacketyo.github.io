          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Harvard University of violating federal civil rights law, citing a failure to protect Israeli and Jewish students from antisemitic harassment. A notice of violation from the Department of Health and Human Services alleges a pattern of unchecked discrimination and deliberate indifference since October 2023. The finding could jeopardize Harvard's federal funding, escalating an ongoing conflict between the university and the administration. Harvard has stated it "strongly disagrees" with the findings and has been taking steps to combat antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has initiated votes on a massive spending package, a key part of President Trump's agenda, following weeks of difficult negotiations. The bill, which extends tax breaks and cuts welfare programs, has exposed rifts within the Republican party, particularly concerning proposed cuts to Medicaid. Democrats have strongly opposed the legislation, arguing it will strip healthcare from millions of low-income Americans. The bill's passage in the Senate is uncertain, and if it passes, it must return to the House for another vote due to Senate amendments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a plan to cut forecasters' access to a Department of Defense satellite data program essential for predicting hurricanes. The decision to delay the cutoff until July 31 came after an apparent intervention from a senior NASA official, following alarm from scientists who warned the move could set forecasting back decades. The administration cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the initial plan to decommission the system. This still leaves forecasters without the data during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has become a central figure of opposition within his party against President Trump's major budget bill. Tillis argues the legislation's deep cuts to Medicaid break promises made to voters and would devastate his state, a stance that led to his sudden retirement announcement after Trump threatened to support a primary challenger. While Tillis's stand has been praised by Democrats, it remains uncertain if his actions will persuade other Republicans to vote against the bill.

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear a Republican-led challenge to federal limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates' campaigns. The case, which will be heard in the next term, questions whether these coordinated expenditure limits violate the First Amendment. Republican party committees argue the government should not restrict their support for their own candidates. In contrast, Democratic committees have vowed to fight the effort, claiming it would upend the campaign finance system and allow wealthy donors to drown out voters' voices.</p>

          <p>Southern California's wildfire season has started intensely, with several fires breaking out across Riverside and San Bernardino counties over the weekend. The largest blaze, the Wolf fire near Banning, grew to 1,400 acres and forced hundreds to evacuate as firefighters worked to contain it. Experts attribute the rapid start to a dry winter that left vegetation parched and ready to burn, creating dangerous conditions even without strong winds. Officials have issued air quality alerts and are concerned that fire activity could soon increase in Northern California as well.</p>

The article points to the recent Test match against India, where fast bowler Josh Tongue's success in quickly taking the last few wickets was a key factor in England's victory. It argues that failing to remove the tail can be psychologically and numerically damaging, citing a past Ashes loss as an example. The piece concludes that mastering this skill will be imperative for England's future success, particularly in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Mexico's Sinaloa state discovered 20 bodies, many of them decapitated, on a highway bridge, highlighting a surge in cartel violence. The gruesome finding is attributed to an ongoing war between factions of the Sinaloa cartel, one loyal to the family of "El Chapo" and the other to Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada. This internal conflict has resulted in over 1,200 deaths since Zambada's capture in the U.S. last year. The violence has been marked by extreme brutality, with bodies often left in public with symbolic items.</p>

          <p>Major food delivery companies Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat have agreed to strengthen security measures to prevent illegal work by asylum seekers and other unauthorized individuals. The agreement with the UK government follows reports of people illegally renting accounts to work as couriers. The companies will increase the use of facial verification and fraud detection technology to ensure only registered, eligible account holders can make deliveries. This move aims to curb illicit account sharing and brings the gig economy companies more in line with standard employment practices.</p>
