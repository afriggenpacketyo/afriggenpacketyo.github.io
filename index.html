          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, winning by a controversial majority decision at Madison Square Garden to defend her super lightweight titles. The fight was highly contested, with one judge scoring it a draw while two others favored Taylor, marking another contentious result in their trilogy. Despite the controversy surrounding the scorecards in all three bouts, Taylor celebrated the satisfying victory, solidifying her status as one of the greatest female boxers. Following the win, Taylor improved her record to 25-1 but remained non-committal about her future in the sport, stating she has nothing left to prove.</p>

          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, with manager Enzo Maresca reportedly planning to maintain an ambitious, attacking style rather than a defensive one. Despite PSG's formidable form, Chelsea sees the match as a key opportunity to validate their youth-focused project and progress. The club is pleased with its strategic direction, having returned to the Champions League and invested heavily in young talent and data analytics. While acknowledging the challenge posed by PSG's high-pressure tactics, Chelsea's players express confidence in their own offensive capabilities and are determined to play their own game.</p>

          <p>Two men have been charged with multiple offenses, including robbery and kidnap, after a police chase ended with a stolen BMW crashing into a care home in Sunderland. The incident resulted in the tragic deaths of two elderly female residents, one in her 80s and another in her 90s. Eight other residents were hospitalized following the crash, which caused major structural damage and forced an evacuation of the facility. Northumbria Police are still investigating whether the crash directly contributed to the two deaths and have referred the case to the police conduct watchdog.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year is predicted to peak on Saturday, with temperatures potentially reaching 34°C in the Midlands and south Wales. Amber heat health alerts are active for much of England, where millions are also under hosepipe bans due to dry conditions. Scotland and Northern Ireland could experience their warmest days of the year, and wildfire warnings have been issued. The heat has also impacted events like Wimbledon, which has implemented special rules for players and increased provisions for fans to cope with the sweltering conditions.</p>

          <p>A farm worker in California has died from injuries after falling from a greenhouse roof during an immigration raid at a cannabis farm. The Department of Homeland Security stated the man was not being pursued by law enforcement when he fell. The raid, part of a broader crackdown on undocumented immigrants, resulted in approximately 200 arrests and sparked protests that led to clashes with federal agents. In response to the protests, President Trump authorized law enforcement to use necessary means to arrest demonstrators, while a federal judge separately ordered a temporary halt to some of the administration's aggressive arrest tactics in the state.</p>

This article suggests the conflict reflects Al Fayed's famously combative approach to business disputes, a legacy that appears to continue after his death.

Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs as the Giants built a commanding lead. Despite the loss, manager Dave Roberts and players found some encouragement in the team's renewed offensive fight, which had been dormant during the losing streak, but acknowledged the pitching and defense must improve.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Raja Shehadeh argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah amounts to a crime against humanity, effectively creating a concentration camp. He contends that the failure of international law to protect Palestinians is not a new phenomenon, dating back to the 1948 Nakba. Shehadeh suggests that hope lies not in legal institutions, which have been ineffective, but in the resilience and 'sumoud' (steadfastness) of the Palestinian people. He concludes that when the war ends, it will be shared humanity, not international law, that ultimately holds Israel and its allies accountable for their actions.</p>

As wars in Ukraine and Gaza strain U.S. stockpiles, American allies are increasingly looking to Seoul for advanced weaponry.

This trend is marked by tech leaders adopting more hawkish stances on China and deepening ties with the U.S. defense industry. Researchers suggest these "tech hawks" could intensify pressure to contain China's technological development and advocate for further decoupling. However, they also note that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA base could ultimately undermine this coalition's ability to reshape U.S. foreign policy toward China in the long term.</p>

The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like race, accent, or presence at specific locations.

Pneumonic plague is the most severe and contagious form as it infects the lungs, but it is treatable with antibiotics if caught early. Officials did not release further details about the victim but advised the public to take precautions when handling sick or dead animals.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Pharmaceutical Firms Develop Rivals to Popular Weight-Loss Drugs Amid Patent Expiration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dozens of Chinese pharmaceutical companies are developing generic versions of popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, as the patent for its key ingredient, semaglutide, is set to expire in China next year. This is expected to create a highly competitive market, potentially driving down prices and increasing access for patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic drug makers in China will compete for a share of the rapidly growing weight-loss market, which is valued at over $150 billion globally. The development promises more affordable treatment options for patients who currently face high costs for these medications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a major $365-million expansion project, even as global trade uncertainty has led to a recent slowdown in cargo activity. The project will expand a key terminal to accommodate larger ships, boosting cargo-handling capacity by 50%. Officials expressed confidence that the investment is crucial for the long-term strength of America's supply chain, despite current drops in container volume at both the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports. The move signals a strategic bet on future growth and the necessity of modernizing infrastructure to remain competitive in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 1,000 U.S. State Department employees, including over 1,100 civil service and 246 foreign service members, have been laid off as part of the Trump administration's plan to reduce the federal workforce. These involuntary cuts follow the voluntary departure of over 1,500 other employees earlier in the year. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue that the mass layoffs will undermine national security and diplomatic effectiveness. The cuts have reportedly affected nearly all staff in the refugee admissions office and those working on Afghan relocation efforts.</p>

          <p>Lord Huron's 2015 song "The Night We Met" has achieved massive, unexpected success, accumulating over three billion plays on Spotify and surpassing the popularity of recent hits by global superstars. Initially an overlooked album track, the song's popularity began to grow after being featured in the Netflix series '13 Reasons Why' in 2017 and has since snowballed through its use in viral TikTok videos. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship. Its slow-burning success is a rare example of a non-hit track finding a massive new life years after its release.</p>

          <p>The popular British soft toy company Jellycat has terminated its supply agreements with approximately 100 independent shops across the UK, leaving many small business owners feeling hurt and confused. Retailers, some of whom have stocked the brand for over two decades, received a generic email stating the decision was part of a "brand elevation strategy" and was non-negotiable. The move comes after Jellycat's popularity surged on social media, and shop owners feel they are being pushed aside in favor of larger retailers after helping build the brand's success. The decision has sparked a backlash from loyal customers on social media.</p>
