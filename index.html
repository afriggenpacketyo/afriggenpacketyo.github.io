          <h2>Putin Calls for Direct Talks with Ukraine Amidst Western Pressure</h2>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested direct talks with Ukraine should commence next week, specifically as early as May 15, aiming to address the root causes of the conflict and move towards a lasting peace. This announcement followed visits from European leaders, including the UK Prime Minister and the French President, who urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov initially responded cautiously, warning against applying pressure on Moscow. The New York Times article notes that Putin's call for talks came amidst threats of new sanctions from Western nations if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire, but Putin has brushed aside those demands.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen and Tufts University student whose visa was canceled amid President Trump's crackdown on higher education, was released from federal custody after a federal judge's order. Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar, had written an opinion piece critical of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Supporters claimed her detention was retaliation for her speech and a violation of the First Amendment. The New York Times article highlights the judge's concern that her detention could chill the speech of non-citizens in the country, as the government had not presented sufficient evidence against Ozturk other than her pro-Palestinian essay.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs that threaten the global economy, with President Trump stating that "great progress" was made and a "total reset" was negotiated in a constructive manner. The talks, involving Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aimed to de-escalate trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. The New York Times article notes that expectations for a breakthrough are low, but the fact that both sides are talking has raised hopes that tensions could be defused. Discussions will continue on Sunday, with the outcome potentially determining the trajectory of the global economy.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, was sentenced to 12 years in state prison for defrauding an elderly San Francisco Bay Area woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth offered the victim "investment opportunities" promising high interest rates, but instead ran a Ponzi scheme, using the money to pay off earlier investors and fund her lifestyle. The victim, who was 66 at the time the fraud began, was left financially destitute as a result of Cohen-Roth's actions.</p>

The New York Times article notes that this directive effectively shelves a tool used for over two decades to weigh the costs and benefits of policies. Critics argue that this decision ignores the scientific consensus on climate change and will make it easier to roll back climate regulations.</p>
