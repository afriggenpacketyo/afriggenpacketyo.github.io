          <p>Authorities are still searching for Grant Hardin, a former police chief nicknamed the "Devil in the Ozarks," who escaped from prison in Arkansas. A survivalist expert warned hikers and outdoorsmen to avoid the Ozarks area, stating that Hardin has little regard for human life and may be armed and dangerous. Hardin was serving time for murder and sexual assault. The FBI and U.S. Marshals are offering a combined $25,000 reward for information leading to his capture, as authorities believe he may still be hiding in caves or rugged terrain in the Ozarks. The search continues as authorities try to capture the escapee.</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market forecasts by reducing its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by a significant softening of inflation and concerns about slower growth amid global uncertainty. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra emphasized that the Indian economy remains strong and stable, despite holding the full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. While acknowledging potential impacts from weather and tariffs, the RBI anticipates continued moderation in commodity prices, signaling a shift to a neutral monetary policy stance with limited room for further easing.

          <p>Four people, including an official from the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) cricket team, have been arrested in India following a deadly stampede during a victory celebration. The RCB offered free tickets to the event at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, leading to a massive crowd of 200,000-300,000 people, far exceeding the stadium's 35,000 capacity. The stampede resulted in 11 deaths and 47 injuries, prompting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to call it a "heartrending" incident. Authorities have taken legal action against RCB representatives, event organizers, and the state cricket association, with demands for greater accountability from the wealthy Indian Premier League regarding fan safety.</p>

          <p>The government has prohibited six water companies from awarding bonuses to senior executives due to failures in meeting environmental and consumer standards. The ban, backdated to April 2024, affects Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water. Regulator Ofwat can now reclaim bonuses already paid or enforce action against these firms, including share awards and cash payments. Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that the public is angered by executives profiting from pollution and emphasized the need for these companies to rebuild trust with their customers. The new measures are part of the beefed-up Water Act, which aims to end the practice of rewarding poor performance.</p>

          <p>A public feud erupted between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, marking a significant downturn in their once-close relationship. The timeline reveals Musk's endorsement of Trump in July 2024 after an assassination attempt, followed by Musk's appointment to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump's re-election. However, tensions rose as Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to his departure from the White House and subsequent trading of insults.

          <p>Israel conducted airstrikes on southern Beirut on the eve of Eid Al Adha, targeting what it claimed was a Hezbollah unit producing drones. The attack occurred despite a ceasefire being in effect between Israel and the armed group for the past six months. The IDF stated that the unit was funded by "Iranian terrorists," and evacuation warnings were issued for several buildings in the area. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the strikes as a "flagrant violation of an international accord," while the UN emphasized the importance of diplomacy to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>Japanese startup ispace Inc. failed in its second attempt to become the first private firm in Asia to land on the Moon, as its lunar lander apparently crashed. The lander, Resilience, began its descent from an altitude of around 100 kilometers but was unable to decelerate to the required speed. Communication was lost, and it is assumed that the lander performed a hard landing on the lunar surface. The company's CEO, Takeshi Hakamada, apologized and stated that they will strive to identify the cause of the failure and make another attempt in 2027.</p>

          <p>Japan's private moon mission by ispace was aborted after the unmanned Resilience spacecraft likely crashed on the moon. The Tokyo-based startup aimed to become the first private company outside the United States to achieve a controlled lunar landing.

CEO Takeshi Hakamada expressed determination to learn from the failure and continue future missions. The mission carried a rover and several payloads, with a planned landing site near the moon's north pole.</p>

          <p>New research by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact on jobs and wages, finding that AI actually makes people "more valuable, not less." The 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, revealing that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. The report challenges the notion that AI leads to decreased job numbers or exacerbates inequalities, suggesting that it enriches jobs by freeing up employees for more complex tasks. The productivity boost from AI can create a "multiplier effect" on the available workforce, benefiting countries with declining working-age populations. (not investment advice)</p>

Over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. The data suggests an increasing number of cases are collapsing due to unavailable evidence, with physical and digital evidence being lost or damaged. Former police officers attribute the issue to overwhelming amounts of evidence and a lack of resources, while experts suggest the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012 has contributed to the problem.</p>
