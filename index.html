          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is facing a renewed and accelerated nuclear arms race, following Russia's formal withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The author points to Vladimir Putin's repeated nuclear threats, the deployment of new hypersonic missiles, and a reciprocal buildup of NATO capabilities in Europe as deeply worrying signs. The piece laments the public's apparent complacency compared to the anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, highlighting record spending by the nine nuclear-armed states. It concludes with a desperate call for a halt to the madness, warning that the risk of global extinction is higher than ever.</p>

          <p>A BBC reporter provides a first-person account of going undercover to investigate a violent migrant-smuggling operation in northern France. Assuming the identity of a Syrian refugee, the journalist navigated the dangers of a secret forest hideout to meet a senior gang member, relying on a hidden camera and a high-risk advisory team. The article details the meticulous planning, the constant fear of being exposed, and the complex, shadowy world ruled by the smugglers. This year-long investigation has already led to an arrest in Birmingham, highlighting the real-world impact of the perilous undercover work.</p>

          <p>A shooting in a Baltimore neighborhood on Saturday night left six people injured, including a five-year-old girl who was struck in the hand. According to Police Commissioner Richard Worley, the victims were gathered outside eating when a suspect opened fire. A 38-year-old man is reported to be in critical condition, while the other victims, including the young girl, sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Police have limited information about the suspect or the motive behind the attack, which they have classified as a "mass shooting," and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A report highlights the significant challenges female refugees face in entering the German workforce, noting a "threefold disadvantage" as women, immigrants, and refugees. While 68% of refugees find work within eight years, two-thirds of refugee women remain unemployed, often due to childcare shortages, language barriers, and difficulties with the recognition of foreign qualifications. The article contrasts the experiences of women from countries like Afghanistan with those from Ukraine but notes common hurdles. It also profiles several non-profit organizations working to dismantle these barriers through counseling, job fairs, and mentoring programs.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell demonstrated a return to his Cy Young-winning form with a commanding performance against the Toronto Blue Jays. In just his second start since a four-month recovery from shoulder inflammation, the left-hander struck out 10 batters over five scoreless innings, leading the team to a 9-1 victory. The win was supported by strong offense, including a 40th season home run from Shohei Ohtani. Snell's successful return bolsters a Dodgers starting rotation that is finally reaching its envisioned potential, providing a significant boost as the team heads towards the postseason.</p>

          <p>A new six-episode documentary, "Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang," has been released by a provincial Chinese broadcaster to bolster Beijing's historical claims over the region. The series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang, portraying him as a national hero. This production is part of a broader effort by President Xi Jinping's government to "forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation" and counter Western narratives about the region's history and governance. The documentary frames the historical conflict as a fight against a jihadist-backed state, aligning with modern counter-terrorism rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a major renaissance after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant slowdown. A combination of post-pandemic inflation, changing drinking habits among younger generations, and the threat of retaliatory tariffs has dampened sales growth. The boom years led to an oversupply as distilleries ramped up production, and now several have filed for bankruptcy or gone into receivership. While the market correction is causing pain for many businesses, some analysts believe this period could spur innovation, similar to how past downturns transformed the Scotch whisky industry.
