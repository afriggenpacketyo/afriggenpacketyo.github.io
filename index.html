          <h2>Senator Warren Introduces Bill to Combat Corporate Price Gouging Amid Rising Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 14:03:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill targeting price gouging by large corporations, asserting that President Trump's tariffs are being exploited for excessive price hikes. The proposed legislation empowers the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to litigate abuses, requiring companies over $100 million in revenue to publicly report significant price changes and provide details on costs and margins. This initiative follows a resurgence of inflation and growing tariff costs, with businesses already citing tariffs for price increases. While some criticize such policies as unsound economics, proponents argue they are necessary to regulate markets when they "go off the rails," aiming to protect American families from undue financial burdens.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned six leaders and affiliates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, including its head, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, known as "Niño Guerrero." This action aims to disrupt the gang's expanding influence and extensive criminal activities across the Western Hemisphere, which include murder, human trafficking, sexual exploitation, kidnapping, and narcotics. The State Department offers rewards for information leading to their arrest or conviction. The Trump administration previously labeled Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, emphasizing continued efforts to dismantle the group and its campaign of violence to enhance community safety.</p>

          <p>Abbott Laboratories' stock declined by 8% after its second-quarter earnings, despite solid revenue, due to disappointing forward guidance. While medical devices and established pharmaceutical sales exceeded expectations, diagnostics and nutrition segments missed. Management tightened full-year earnings per share guidance and lowered the adjusted operating margin outlook, falling short of investor expectations for an increase. The article notes ongoing litigation regarding a specialized infant formula and sluggish diagnostics sales in China as contributing factors to the cautious outlook. Investors are advised to await further insights from management before buying more shares (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are proposing legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act, aiming to unlock federal funding for affected communities. This initiative follows a record-breaking June heat dome that caused numerous heat-related illnesses and deaths, yet extreme heat is not currently eligible for federal disaster aid. Critics, including a former FEMA administrator, argue existing hazard mitigation grants could address the issue, while business groups oppose new federal heat protection rules for workers. The article highlights the ongoing uphill battle for significant federal action to protect communities from escalating heat risks.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Plans to Lower Voting Age to 16, Sparking Debate on Political Impact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to lower the voting age to 16 by the next general election, aiming to boost democratic engagement among young people. Critics suggest this move could disproportionately benefit the Labour Party, given the historical tendency of younger voters to lean left. However, YouGov polls indicate a fragmented youth vote, and research from other countries with 16-year-old voting shows a negligible impact on overall election results. While 16-17 year olds represent a small percentage of the electorate and turnout tends to be lower for younger age groups, even small shifts in multi-party politics could still influence outcomes in marginal constituencies.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's claim that Coca-Cola will switch to cane sugar, experts weigh in on the health differences between cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup. While minor chemical differences exist, both sweeteners have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess, contributing to issues like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Cane sugar is less processed, but both have high glycemic indexes and similar calorie counts. Experts emphasize that moderation is key, as both provide "empty calories" and Americans generally consume far more than recommended amounts of added sugars.</p>

The article highlights that green energy historically receives significantly higher subsidies than fossil fuels, emphasizing that even a partial rollback of $500 billion in savings demonstrates that policy reform against special interests is achievable.</p>
