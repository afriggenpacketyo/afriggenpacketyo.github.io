          <p>China's foreign ministry has condemned Japan's new space defense guidelines, alleging they are a pretext for developing space weapons in cooperation with the United States. A Chinese spokesperson claimed these actions threaten regional stability and raise concerns about a revival of militarism. The Japanese guidelines cite threats from nations like China and Russia, who are developing technologies to disable satellites. This escalation comes as the U.S. and Japan increase their collaboration on space-based surveillance and intelligence.</p>

          <p>Australia's second-quarter inflation rate slowed to 2.1% year-over-year, its lowest level since early 2021 and below economists' expectations. This figure approaches the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range, increasing speculation about a potential interest rate cut in August. While the RBA has already cut rates twice this year, it held them steady in its last meeting to confirm the inflation trend. Key price increases were in housing and food, but these were partially offset by a drop in transport costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 21:53:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a proposal to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save billions and increase consumer choice for vehicles. Critics, including scientists and environmental groups, have condemned the proposal, citing overwhelming evidence of climate change's threats and calling the move dangerous. The reversal would dismantle regulations for vehicles and power plants and is expected to face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed his connection to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Epstein had "stole" young female staffers, including Virginia Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago club. The comments were made aboard Air Force One amid ongoing questions about his administration's transparency regarding the Epstein case. Trump confirmed that some of the workers taken were young women who worked at the spa, specifically identifying Giuffre as one of them. The remarks bring new attention to a case that the president has previously shown annoyance with discussing.</p>

As part of the settlement, UCLA admitted it had "fallen short" and will fund groups supporting the Jewish community and a campus anti-antisemitism initiative.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his government will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the war in Gaza. The conditions include agreeing to a ceasefire, committing to a two-state solution, and allowing the UN to restart aid supplies without any annexation in the West Bank. This move follows a similar announcement from France and adds to the mounting international pressure on Israel to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the announcement, calling it a "reward for Hamas' monstrous terrorism."</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of economists and fund managers shows a near three-way tie for who might replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh each received 24% of the vote, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett close behind at 22%. President Trump has been critical of Powell, but 84% of respondents believe he will not be fired before his term ends in May 2026. The survey also indicated that political pressure is making rate cuts less likely in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a resolution to support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force amid reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may disband it. The task force, composed of independent medical experts, provides evidence-based recommendations for crucial preventive care like cancer screenings, which are typically covered by insurance without co-pays. The resolution recognizes the task force's important work and calls for it to continue without political disruption. Lawmakers are concerned that dismantling the committee could compromise public health and lead to recommendations not based on scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>The gunman in the recent Manhattan shooting believed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma. CTE involves the buildup of abnormal proteins, leading to mood swings, dementia, and other negative effects, and is often associated with contact sports like football. While it can only be diagnosed posthumously, studies have found CTE in a high percentage of deceased former football players' brains. The disease has been linked to violence and suicide in several high-profile cases involving former NFL players, raising ongoing concerns about sports safety.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy who died from a rare brain-eating amoeba infection, are speaking out to raise awareness of the risks of swimming in freshwater. The infection, primary amebic meningoencephalitis, occurs when the Naegleria fowleri organism enters the brain through the nose. The family stated that they were unaware of the danger of swimming in Lake Murray, South Carolina, and do not want their son's death to be in vain. Health officials recommend holding one's nose or using a nose clip when jumping into freshwater to reduce the risk of this often-fatal infection.</p>

          <p>The L.A. County Board of Supervisors has taken a step toward banning all law enforcement, including federal immigration agents, from concealing their identities with masks or gaiters in unincorporated areas. The move responds to numerous incidents of armed, masked federal agents conducting immigration raids where they refused to identify themselves. While the county sheriff already has a clear identification policy, the new rule is aimed squarely at ICE. The county's legal counsel anticipates a constitutional challenge from the federal government based on the supremacy clause, but supervisors appear prepared for a court battle.</p>

          <p>Following the EPA's proposal to repeal its "endangerment finding" for greenhouse gases, California may be positioned to lead a counter-movement. State regulators and experts suggest that California's long history of pioneering its own strict environmental standards provides a strong foundation for continued action. While the federal rollback could complicate national climate goals, some legal experts believe it might unintentionally strengthen states' authority to regulate emissions. California has already initiated legal challenges against previous Trump administration environmental rollbacks and plans to continue defending its aggressive climate policies.</p>

Her death has been ruled accidental by the county sheriff's office, and the National Park Service is investigating the incident. The popular hiking area was temporarily closed following the accident, which adds to the small number of fatal incidents that occur in the park each year.</p>

The development will focus on brownfield sites, such as former goods yards and industrial areas, with initial projects planned for Manchester, Newcastle, and other cities. A new development company, Platform4, will be created to streamline the process. While the government is promoting its "brownfield first" approach, industry groups warn that planning delays and regulatory hurdles are already holding up tens of thousands of other housing projects.

The new migration minister cited an "invasion" from Libya as justification for the move, which has been criticized by human rights lawyers as illegal. More than 7,000 migrants have reached Crete this year, and those arriving now, including people fleeing war in Sudan, are being held in detention facilities with no opportunity to request protection.

          <p>Russian soldiers returning from the war in Ukraine are reportedly being robbed and scammed out of their substantial salaries and injury payments, sometimes by government officials. Despite President Putin's promise of a hero's welcome, the BBC found cases of soldiers being extorted by traffic police or having their bank accounts drained by recruitment center staff. In one instance, police officers allegedly tipped off taxi drivers to overcharge and rob returning servicemen. The large financial incentives used to attract volunteers have made these soldiers targets for criminals upon their return home.</p>
