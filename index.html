          <p>Disney revealed its intention to construct a new theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi, marking its first venture in the Middle East and seventh park globally. The agreement was reached with Abu Dhabi-based Miral, with the park planned for Yas Island, already home to attractions like Ferrari World and Warner Bros. World. The attraction aims to blend Disney's signature entertainment with the cultural essence of Abu Dhabi, targeting visitors from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. However, the article also acknowledges concerns regarding labor practices in the United Arab Emirates, particularly concerning migrant workers.</p>

          <p>A United States Navy fighter jet went overboard while attempting to land on the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea, marking the second such incident in two weeks. According to the United States Central Command, the aircraft's arrestment system failed, causing the jet to fall into the water. Both pilots ejected and sustained minor injuries, and were rescued by a helicopter. The accident occurred amid ongoing tensions in the region, including Houthi attacks on commercial and military ships, although officials confirmed the jet was not struck by the Houthis.

          <p>Four Republican members of the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an order that sought to disenfranchise over 5,000 voters, part of an effort by Judge Jefferson Griffin to overturn Justice Allison Riggs’s reelection. The Republican justices are attempting to replace Justice Riggs with Griffin, who lost the election by just 734 votes. The article draws parallels to Bush v. Gore, noting that the North Carolina Supreme Court is allegedly recreating the same constitutional violation by applying non-uniform rules after an election has already happened. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the state from certifying the election results pending litigation.</p>

          <p>Experts predict a slight decrease in federal student loan interest rates for the 2025-2026 academic year. The interest rate for federal direct undergraduate loans could drop to 6.39%, down from 6.53% in the 2024-2025 year. Graduate students may also see a decrease, with rates potentially falling to 7.94% from the current 8.08%.

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, saw a significant increase in April, reaching its highest level since October 2023. Cox Automotive reports that this 4.9% year-over-year jump is attributed to consumers rushing to purchase vehicles amid concerns over price increases due to auto tariffs. While the tariffs don't directly affect used car sales, they influence new vehicle prices, impacting the used car market. Retail used-vehicle sales decreased slightly from March but remain higher year-over-year, with average listing prices exceeding $25,000.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a deadly attack on tourists in Kashmir, with India conducting strikes on what it claims were terrorist sites within Pakistan. Pakistan has vowed retaliation, stating that Indian strikes killed civilians, including children, and shot down Indian fighter jets. International law experts argue India's strikes are unlawful, raising fears of a spiraling military conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations.

          <p>During a traffic stop in central Ohio, police encountered a pet raccoon named "Chewy" with a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth, sitting in the driver's seat of the pulled-over car. A thorough search of the vehicle led to the discovery of methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and additional used methamphetamine pipes. The vehicle was stopped due to the registered owner having an active warrant and a suspended driver's license, leading to the arrest of 55-year-old Victoria Vidal on drug possession and paraphernalia charges. The raccoon was unharmed, and the owner had the required permits to legally own the animal.</p>

          <p>The National Audit Office reports that the cost of accommodating asylum seekers in the UK is expected to triple, reaching £15.3 billion over ten years, significantly higher than the initial £4.5 billion estimate. The increase is primarily due to the rising number of asylum seekers housed in hotels, which account for three-quarters of accommodation spending despite housing only a third of asylum seekers. Private providers are reportedly profiting more from hotels than other accommodation types, raising concerns about cost control and value for taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Amidst ongoing disagreements over monetary policy, Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, raising questions about the president's authority to remove him from office. While historically presidents have respected the independence of the central bank, Trump has publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with Powell's decisions. The Fed chair maintains that his position is protected by law, allowing removal only for cause; however, an ongoing Supreme Court case may alter the president's power over federal agencies, adding uncertainty to the situation.</p>

          <p>Major cuts to federal health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are raising concerns among cancer patients and doctors about potential setbacks in research and treatment. The NIH, a leading funder of cancer research, is expected to lose about 1,200 jobs and see the cancellation of numerous research grants. Patient advocacy groups express fear that these cuts could erase decades of progress in cancer care, leading to delayed or lost treatment opportunities for patients.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors allege that two men chopped down the famous Sycamore Gap tree as a "bit of a laugh" and now fear becoming public enemy number one. Daniel Michael Graham and Adam Carruthers deny criminal damage relating to the tree and Hadrian's Wall. The prosecution claims that Mr. Graham's phone and car were tracked to the site and that a video of the tree being felled was filmed on his phone. The men claim they were at home and that Mr. Carruthers admitted to the crime.</p>

As India struck Pakistan on Wednesday in retaliation, Ms. Narwal became shorthand for why India picked the name “Operation Sindoor” for its military action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India named its military operation against Pakistan 'Operation Sindoor', a reference to the red vermilion powder worn by Hindu women as a symbol of marriage, which is wiped off upon widowhood. This New York Times article explains that the name signals India's intention to avenge the widowed women who lost their husbands in a recent terrorist attack. While the name resonates with right-wing Hindu groups, some feminists criticize its use, arguing that it reinforces patriarchal views of women as objects to be protected.</p>

It’s an accusation that stings partly because there’s truth behind it: Real evidence suggests that liberal institutions, the Democratic Party chief among them, inhabit a moral universe distinct from that of the median voter.\n\nYet far less attention has been paid to the disconnect between the right’s intellectual elite and the American public. Liberal intellectuals live in an unrepresentative world, but so too do the right’s thinkers — causing them to develop an idea of America that is largely unmoored from the country most Americans experience.</p>
