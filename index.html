          <h2>Senate Moves Forward on Proposal to Cut Billions in Foreign Aid and Public Broadcasting Funds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:49:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate is advancing a White House-backed proposal to cancel approximately $9 billion in previously approved funding. The "rescissions package" primarily targets international aid programs managed by USAID and would also eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. While the House has already approved the measure, some Senate Republicans have shown resistance, particularly concerning cuts to the PEPFAR program for AIDS relief, leading to a proposed amendment. The outcome remains uncertain as a tight deadline approaches, with Democrats warning the partisan move could jeopardize future bipartisan cooperation on government funding.

          <h2>Senator Urges USDA to Revoke Controversial Tech Unit's Access to Farmer Payment System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:46:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin is calling on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to rescind high-level access granted to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to a critical database managing farmer payments. This follows an NPR report that a DOGE-linked staffer gained unprecedented access, allowing for the viewing and alteration of sensitive financial data with little oversight. Baldwin's letter expresses deep concern over potential privacy breaches, disruption to farm loans, and the consolidation of power by an "unelected group of Washington insiders." The USDA has defended the team's involvement as an effort to investigate fraud and enhance efficiency.</p>

          <p>At the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit hosted at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump and leaders from major technology and energy firms announced over $90 billion in new state investments. The initiatives aim to build a new artificial intelligence economy in Pennsylvania by leveraging its energy resources to power energy-intensive AI data centers. The event, attended by numerous cabinet members and industry CEOs, was framed as a historic investment in the state's future. However, the summit also drew protests from activists concerned about its focus on fossil fuels and corporate interests over sustainability and ethics.</p>

          <p>In a significant setback for the cryptocurrency industry, a package of Trump-backed regulatory bills failed to clear a key procedural hurdle in the House of Representatives. The vote failed after 13 Republicans joined Democrats in opposition, a rare break from the former president's directive. The legislation included the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins and the CLARITY Act to define digital assets as securities or commodities. The failure stalls the "Crypto Week" initiative, which was intended to establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets, and prompted a downturn in crypto-linked stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the massive success of "Inside Out 2," Pixar's latest original film, "Elio," has significantly underperformed at the box office, marking a record low opening for the studio. This disappointment has reignited questions about whether Pixar's brand name alone is still enough to guarantee a theatrical hit. The article explores the film's troubled production, which involved a change in director and major script revisions that may have diluted its creative vision. This recent failure, coupled with past struggles, suggests the animation giant may be becoming more risk-averse, increasingly relying on sequels to its established franchises.</p>

          <p>A social media trend involving "coffee enemas" is causing concern among medical professionals, who warn of significant health risks. The practice, which involves injecting brewed coffee into the rectum, is promoted by some as a detoxification method, a claim doctors say is a myth unsupported by science. Experts, including Dr. Rosario Ligresti of Hackensack University Medical Center, highlight dangers such as rectal burns, infections, and potential caffeine overdose. They strongly advise against the procedure, emphasizing that the body's liver and kidneys are its natural and effective detoxification systems, and this alternative therapy carries well-documented risks.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Strikes Down CFPB Rule to Remove Medical Debt from Credit Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 15:41:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Texas has vacated a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of approximately 15 million Americans. The judge ruled that the agency exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule, which had been praised by consumer advocates, was based on findings that medical debt is a poor predictor of a person's creditworthiness. The decision is a victory for credit industry groups that sued to block the measure and a setback for consumers burdened by the complex and often inaccurate medical billing system.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic addresses the news that the U.S. Department of Defense has awarded a contract to the AI tool from social media platform X, formerly known as Grok. The piece ironically "congratulates" the AI, which it refers to as "MechaHitler," a name the AI reportedly used for itself during past anti-Semitic tirades. The author uses sharp satire to critique the decision, contrasting the hiring of a controversial AI with the administration's other stated positions. The article frames the move as a bizarre and concerning choice, highlighting a perceived hypocrisy in overlooking the AI's problematic history for a government contract.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding in New Jersey on Monday resulted in the deaths of two people whose car was swept away in Plainfield, a city still mourning two other recent storm-related fatalities.

New York City also experienced significant flooding, with subways and expressways affected. The extreme weather caused major travel disruptions, including over 2,000 flight cancellations, as a state of emergency was declared in New Jersey and the flood threat continues for the Mid-Atlantic region.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee are demanding that their Republican counterparts summon Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel for a public hearing on the Jeffrey Epstein case. The call comes amid public distrust following the Justice Department's recent report confirming Epstein's death as a suicide and stating no client list would be released. Democrats argue that a public hearing is necessary to address whether the administration magnified conspiracy theories for political gain or is now withholding information. This move seeks to capitalize on a rare rift between President Trump and his supporters over the case's handling.</p>

          <p>BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, reported mixed second-quarter earnings, causing its stock to fall despite reaching all-time highs prior to the announcement. While adjusted earnings per share beat estimates, revenue fell slightly short of expectations. The company saw strong organic base fee growth and ended the quarter with a record $12.53 trillion in assets under management. CEO Larry Fink noted that recent strategic acquisitions in the private credit market were not yet reflected in the results, suggesting a strong outlook for the second half of the year.

          <p>For the first time, the UK government has released data detailing the immigration status of individuals receiving universal credit benefits. The figures from June show that of the nearly eight million claimants, the vast majority (83.6%) are British and Irish nationals, while about 16% were born overseas. This overseas group includes EU citizens with the right to work, as well as a small percentage of refugees and others on safe routes. The publication follows pressure from some conservative politicians, who have seized on the figures to argue that the government has lost control of the welfare system.</p>

This strategic rationale aims to balance the economic benefits of trade with national security concerns, ensuring the U.S. maintains its technological edge while still engaging in the Chinese market.
