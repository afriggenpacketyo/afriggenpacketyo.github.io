The main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal, as presented by Israeli officials to the U.N. and its aid partners.

The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, suggested more strongly that a deal had been reached. The article notes that Trump's rhetoric, that China needs to be “opened” to US business seemed to ignore a half century of trade between the two nations since one of his political heroes, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972.</p>
