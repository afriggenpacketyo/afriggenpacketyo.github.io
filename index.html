          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk reassured investors at Bloomberg's Qatar Economic Forum that he intends to remain at the helm of the electric vehicle company for the next five years, emphasizing the importance of maintaining sufficient voting control to prevent potential ousting by activist investors. Musk clarified that his motivation is not financial gain but rather ensuring reasonable control over Tesla's future, which comes after investor concerns about his dedication to Tesla, given his advisory role in President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Despite a reported 20% drop in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income for the first quarter of 2025, Tesla shares saw a slight increase following Musk's statement.</p>

          <p>The UK has suspended negotiations with Israel on a free trade agreement in response to the escalation of military operations in Gaza, which has sparked international outcry over the humanitarian situation. British Foreign Minister David Lammy condemned the offensive and called for an end to Israel's blockade on Gaza, saying that it is not the correct way to ensure the release of Israeli hostages. The UK was joined by France and Canada in a joint statement condemning Israel's actions, and a spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Minister played down what he called "anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations."</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia is prioritizing his approach to negotiate a comprehensive peace deal and continue to wage war in Ukraine, and in recent weeks, has defended his approach to negotiate a comprehensive peace deal while continuing to wage war in Ukraine.

Despite this, the Kremlin said that the war in Ukraine had been just one of the issues discussed by Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump, and that the leaders remained committed to a broader reset.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering accepting a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, due to delays in the delivery of new planes. The move involves secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role. The arrangement has drawn condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans, as well as ethics lawyers, who said it looked either like Mr. Trump himself was taking the gift or that the Qataris were using it to curry favor with the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study casts doubt on the presence of flowing water on Mars, specifically challenging the interpretation of dark streaks seen on the planet's surface. Researchers used machine learning to analyze over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images of slope streaks, creating a global Martian map showing more than half a million such features. The analysis revealed that the slope streaks were not generally associated with factors suggesting a liquid or frost origin, and the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin.</p>

Britain went a step further and said that it was suspending talks with Israel on expanding a free-trade agreement and would impose sanctions on several more extremist Israeli settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>

          <p>Israel has recovered thousands of items belonging to Eli Cohen, the country's most famous spy, after a covert operation in Syria, 60 years after he was executed. The items include documents, recordings, photos, and letters, providing insights into Cohen's activities and his capture by Syrian intelligence. Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian government in the 1960s, is credited with providing crucial intelligence that helped Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, and his remains have yet to be returned to Israel, where he is regarded as a national hero.</p>
