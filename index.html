        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asserted that the Trump administration's deregulatory actions would not adversely impact public health or the environment, emphasizing the need to balance environmental protection with economic growth. Zeldin highlighted the reconsideration of regulations across various sectors, including power plants and oil and gas development, as part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy. However, the Environmental Protection Network, comprised of former EPA employees, estimates that these rollbacks could lead to increased air pollution, resulting in premature deaths and asthma attacks. Zeldin maintains that the American people want common sense applied to regulations, arguing that the previous administration's policies were too broad and costly, and encourages public input during the deregulatory process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, discussions have begun regarding potential successors to lead the Catholic Church, with several cardinals emerging as prominent candidates. Pietro Parolin, the current secretary of state for the Holy See, is an experienced diplomat who has worked on behalf of the Church in various countries, but his deal to give the Chinese government authority over the appointment process for bishops in the country created some detractors who said it hamstrung the church's ability to criticize human rights abuses. Matteo Zuppi, the archbishop of Bologna, has served in a diplomatic function for the Vatican, tasked by the late pope in 2023 with leading a peace mission to Ukraine, that involved travel to Moscow as well as Washington and Beijing. Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, has devoted himself to ministry in a region frequently mired by conflict and humanitarian crises — most recently at the center of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Other potential candidates include Jose Tolentino de Mendonca, Luis Antonio Tagle, and Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, each bringing unique experiences and perspectives to the table.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, challenging the freeze of billions in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the lawsuit is a response to the administration's demands to alter university policies and leadership, including auditing for viewpoint diversity. The lawsuit asserts that the Trump administration's actions violate Harvard's constitutional rights and impede critical research. The Trump administration responded that taxpayer funds are a privilege that Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions to access, alleging that the university enriches its bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers, led by Professor Wang Chao, have made a significant advancement in quantum cryptology by successfully factoring a 90-bit RSA integer using a D-Wave Advantage quantum computer. This achievement, once considered impossible, raises concerns about the potential for quantum computers to decipher even the most secure encryption, leading to a hypothetical "Q-Day" scenario where personal privacy and data security are severely threatened. The development has sparked a global race to develop quantum technologies and countermeasures, including post-quantum cryptography, to stay ahead of this looming threat. RSA encryption, widely used in securing digital communications, relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large integers, making this breakthrough a significant development in the field.</p>

          <p>Norwich City has dismissed head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup following a series of defeats and has appointed former Arsenal and England midfielder Jack Wilshere as the interim head coach for the remaining two games of the season. Sporting director Ben Knapper cited recent results and performances as the reason for the change, despite the initial long-term focus of Thorup's appointment. Wilshere, previously the manager of Arsenal's under-18 team, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley as he takes charge of the team. Norwich currently sits in 14th place in the Championship table, having scored the second-most goals in the league but also conceding a high number.</p>

Abrego Garcia, who had protected legal status, was deported due to an administrative error, though some Trump administration officials claim he is a member of MS-13.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Climate change is increasingly threatening the American fishing industry, which generates nearly $100 billion annually, as rising river temperatures deplete oxygen levels and harm fish populations. Research indicates that a significant percentage of rivers in the U.S. and Europe are warming, leading to reduced fish habitats. Fly fishing guides, like Brian Sheppard, are finding it harder to sustain their livelihoods as water temperatures frequently exceed the threshold for good fishing. Organizations like Friends of the Upper Delaware River are working to restore river flows and protect the fishing-tourism economy, emphasizing the importance of preserving these resources for future generations.</p>

This comes as Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities continue, with a recent attack on an apartment block in Zaporizhzhia resulting in casualties. Putin's remarks followed Zelensky's suggestion of a 30-day ceasefire on civilian targets, prompted by a brief Easter truce. While Zelensky has not directly responded to Putin's comments, he has stated Ukraine's readiness for any conversation that ensures civilian safety, clarifying that Ukraine needed a "clear answer from Moscow" on whether it would agree to stop attacks on civilian infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists Mark Blyth and Nicolò Fraccaroli argue that while tariffs may raise prices, the climate crisis presents a more significant long-term inflation risk. They highlight the impact of climate change on insurance markets, food supplies, and decarbonization efforts. Rising damage costs from droughts, wildfires, and floods are causing insurance costs to soar, while climate change is projected to increase food inflation. The authors suggest that the climate crisis and states backing off decarbonization efforts will be the real drivers of future inflation, forces that no amount of central bank tinkering can accommodate.</p>

Despite populist rhetoric, the Republican Party has consistently prioritized tax cuts for the affluent, often obscuring their intentions with misleading statements. The addition of a national-conservative faction, led by Vice President J. D. Vance, has introduced a new element to the coalition, potentially more open to raising taxes on the rich to achieve broader political goals. However, the traditional anti-government conservatives within the party continue to prioritize low taxes and decreased business regulation, maintaining the coalition's focus on economic libertarianism.</p>

          <p>Thousands of properties in west Devon, including homes, schools, and leisure centers, are experiencing water supply disruptions following a burst water pipe. South West Water (SWW) confirmed that thousands of properties were experiencing a loss of water supply or lower water pressure than usual, after the initial burst. The company is working to restore supplies but cautions that it may take time to refill the complex system properly and safely. Bottled water stations have been set up, and compensation payments will be available to those affected as a gesture of goodwill.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party is pushing for a ban on the recording of non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs) by police forces in England and Wales, except in limited circumstances. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch argues that NCHIs have wasted police time chasing ideology and grievance instead of justice. However, Policing Minister Diana Johnson contends that the plan is unworkable and would prevent the police from monitoring serious antisemitism and other racist incidents. NCHIs are defined as alleged acts perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards people with certain characteristics, but do not amount to a criminal offense.</p>
