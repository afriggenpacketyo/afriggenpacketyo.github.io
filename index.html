          <p>Following an attack on tourists in Pahalgam, Kashmir, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised decisive action against the perpetrators, vowing to pursue them relentlessly. Modi convened an all-party meeting to discuss the government's response and summoned Pakistan's top diplomat, subsequently downgrading diplomatic ties with Islamabad. The attack resulted in 26 fatalities, including a Nepalese national, and numerous injuries. India also issued a persona non grata note for all Pakistani military diplomats, signaling escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the luxury goods group owning Gucci, experienced a significant drop after announcing lower-than-expected first-quarter sales due to macroeconomic challenges. Gucci sales, nearly half of Kering's revenue, declined sharply, reflecting ongoing brand turnaround efforts and a broader downturn in the luxury market amid higher inflation. The company faces headwinds in Asia, North America, and Europe, prompting increased vigilance to strengthen its market position. Despite naming a new artistic director, investors remain concerned about controversy surrounding the label and the potential impact of tariffs.</p>

Companies face substantial fines or potential UK bans for non-compliance, with the rules subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act.
