          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked a judge to consider jailing Beto O’Rourke for allegedly violating a court order. The order blocked O'Rourke's political group from fundraising to cover the costs of Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the passage of a Republican-backed congressional map. Paxton claims O'Rourke continued to solicit donations after the ruling and is requesting fines and jail time until he complies. This legal action represents an escalation in the contentious political battle over redistricting in Texas.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has surpassed 50,000 since the Labour party took office last summer. This milestone puts significant political pressure on the government, which had pledged to reduce crossing numbers and dismantle smuggling gangs. The opposition has criticized the government's plan as ineffective, while the government maintains it is implementing new measures to address the challenge. The situation is further highlighted by a recent report of a woman dying while attempting the crossing from France.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore allowing 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this could offer higher returns and democratize access to asset classes previously reserved for wealthy investors. However, financial experts caution that these investments carry significantly higher risks, greater complexity, and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds, raising concerns about their suitability for typical retirement savers.

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has secured a significant legal victory after a federal appeals court lifted a preliminary injunction that had blocked its access to certain citizen data. The ruling allows the agency to obtain potentially sensitive information from departments like Education and Treasury, which had been temporarily halted due to privacy concerns. While the broader legal case on the merits will continue, this decision allows the Trump administration to proceed with its data access plans for now.</p>

In a social media post, Trump also reiterated his demand for an immediate interest rate cut, calling Powell a "loser" and blaming him for incalculable damage. This move intensifies the conflict between the White House and the independent central bank, which has so far resisted demands for rapid rate cuts.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has reportedly told companies to avoid using specific AI chips from U.S. firms Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for government and national security applications. This directive comes after the White House confirmed a deal for the chipmakers to give 15% of their China revenues to the U.S. government. The move signals an escalation in the U.S.-China tech rivalry, potentially impacting a crucial market for American semiconductor companies and furthering China's goal of technological self-reliance.</p>

          <p>This article offers financial strategies for retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) but don't need the money for immediate expenses. Experts recommend two primary options to manage the tax implications. One is to reinvest the funds into a tax-efficient brokerage account, often using exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another popular strategy is to make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows for a direct, tax-free transfer from an IRA to a nonprofit to satisfy the RMD. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July indicated that inflation rose 2.7% on an annual basis, a figure slightly below economists' forecasts. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased to 3.1%, its highest level in five months. The data presents a mixed picture for the economy, with falling gasoline prices helping to offset continued increases in the cost of food and the potential price impacts of newly implemented tariffs.

          <p>A severe heatwave across southern Europe, with temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F), is fueling dozens of major wildfires.

          <p>An official service inquiry has found that British soldiers stationed at the Batuk training base in Kenya are continuing to engage in transactional sex, despite a 2022 Ministry of Defence ban on the practice. The investigation was initiated following years of controversy surrounding soldier misconduct, including the 2012 death of a local woman, Agnes Wanjiru. The report concluded the activity is occurring at a "low to moderate" level and recommended measures for easier dismissal of offending soldiers.</p>
