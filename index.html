          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 09:50:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's legal team has asked a federal judge to reject a request from Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for a temporary order preventing her dismissal. The move follows Trump's attempt to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she contends are a pretext for an illegal removal. The Federal Reserve itself has urged a "prompt ruling" to resolve the uncertainty surrounding Cook's position on the board. This legal confrontation represents a significant test of a president's authority over the historically independent central bank and is expected to escalate to the Supreme Court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new regulation that would impose fixed time limits on visas for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists. Under the new rule, student and exchange visitor visas would be limited to a four-year period, while journalist visas could be restricted to as little as 90 days for Chinese nationals. Currently, these visas are valid for the duration of a program or employment, and the change would require holders to apply for extensions. The administration states the measure is necessary for better oversight, though critics argue it creates unnecessary hurdles for legal immigration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing significant bipartisan backlash following the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez just one month into her tenure. The dismissal, reportedly for refusing to align with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine agenda, has caused turmoil within the agency, leading to multiple resignations and a staff walkout. Republican senators like Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy have expressed alarm, questioning the lack of scientific process and political interference at the nation's top public health institution. The conflict underscores a deepening divide between the administration's political goals and the scientific community's established principles.</p>

          <p>Defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is confronting a challenging period in his career after being dropped from the England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The decision by coach Thomas Tuchel, who has openly questioned Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities, compounds a difficult start at his new club, Real Madrid. After leaving Liverpool, he has struggled for form and now faces stiff competition from the fit-again club legend Dani Carvajal. This dual setback at both the club and international level casts doubt on his prospects for the World Cup and marks a significant obstacle in what was expected to be a glittering career phase.</p>

          <p>Shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged by 20% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share and a 33% year-over-year revenue increase to $876 million, signaling robust consumer spending. CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in consumer strength and the company's ability to manage loan repayments, assuaging concerns about losing Walmart as a partner.

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially canceled the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective September 1. Harris was legally entitled to six months of security after leaving office, but former President Joe Biden had issued a directive extending it for another year. The Trump administration revoked this extension, stating a recent threat assessment found no alarming information to warrant the additional protection. This move has drawn criticism from figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who labeled it an act of political retaliation, part of a pattern of revoking protections for former officials and political opponents.</p>

Witnesses describe the initial confusion turning to horror, with older students and adults shielding younger children from the gunfire. Despite the chaos, acts of courage and prayer were prevalent as the community grappled with the violence that shattered its sense of peace.</p>

While domestic pressures have impacted profitability, BYD's overseas sales have surged dramatically, with international deliveries increasing by almost 145% year-over-year.

          <p>While the median price of condominiums in the U.S. has fallen by 2.1% year-over-year, prospective buyers may not be getting a bargain. According to Redfin data, rising costs for homeowners association (HOA) dues, insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements are offsetting the lower sale prices. An oversupply of condos, particularly in states like Florida and Texas, is driving prices down, but these hidden monthly expenses can make long-term affordability comparable to more expensive single-family homes. Experts advise buyers to look beyond the sticker price and carefully analyze a building's financial health before purchasing.</p>

He argues this gap threatens the backbone of the country and calls for significant investment in workforce development and vocational training to address critical labor shortages.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have suggested in a court filing that Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, may have influenced last month's deadly shooting at the NFL's Manhattan headquarters. They argue that Mangione's targeted killing was intended to "normalize the use of violence" for political objectives, citing the subsequent attack by Shane Tamura, who also left behind writings explaining his motives. Prosecutors believe Mangione poses an ongoing danger by seeking to inspire others to violence, which is part of their reasoning for pursuing the death penalty in his case. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

          <h2>Tensions Rise Between Ukraine and Hungary Following Attack on Druzhba Oil Pipeline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Relations between Ukraine and Hungary have become increasingly strained after Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia disrupted Hungary's crucial oil supply. Hungarian officials labeled the attack a threat to Europe's energy security, while Ukraine maintains its goal is to undermine Russia's war economy, not target Hungary. The incident exposes Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian energy, a reliance that has persisted despite EU sanctions. The conflict is further complicated by Hungary's ongoing blockade of Ukraine's EU accession talks, creating a tense diplomatic standoff between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>Colin Smyth, a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), has denied a new allegation of hiding a secret camera in a toilet at the Holyrood parliament building. Smyth has been barred from the building due to the ongoing criminal investigation. This charge comes after he was suspended by the Labour party earlier this month over a separate investigation into the possession of indecent images of children. Smyth stated the new allegation was an "utter shock" and criticized Police Scotland for releasing details that he says forced him to leave his home. The parliament has confirmed that a police search found no recording devices.</p>

          <p>An Italian website named Phica, known for posting digitally altered, explicit images of prominent women including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has been forced to shut down. The closure follows a significant backlash from female politicians and the public, who condemned the site's obscene and sexist content. The platform, which reportedly had 700,000 users, announced its closure due to the "toxic behaviour" of some users. This event comes shortly after Meta shut down a similar Italian Facebook group where men were sharing intimate images of their partners without consent, highlighting a growing movement in Italy against online misogyny and exploitation.</p>

          <p>A vessel carrying approximately 160 migrants, primarily from The Gambia and Senegal, has capsized off the coast of Mauritania, resulting in at least 49 deaths and around 100 people missing. The dugout canoe was en route to Spain's Canary Islands when the accident occurred. According to survivors, the boat overturned after passengers moved to one side upon spotting coastal lights. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers of the Atlantic migration route, which has seen a surge in traffic and a high number of fatalities, with one NGO estimating over 9,000 deaths last year alone.</p>

          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.8% for the quarter ending in June, exceeding economists' forecasts of 6.7%. The strong growth was driven by robust performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some economists point to a potential slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which isn't adjusted for inflation, decreased compared to the previous quarter. Despite concerns about the impact of new U.S. tariffs, analysts believe India is on track to achieve world-leading growth of around 7% for the year, supported by proactive monetary policy from its central bank.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, a photo retrospective revisits the storm that became the costliest and one of the deadliest in U.S. history. The storm ultimately caused nearly 1,400 deaths and inundated 80% of New Orleans after its levee system failed, leading to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The images capture the devastation across the Gulf Coast, the thousands stranded without aid, and the heavily criticized slow federal response. Two decades later, many communities, particularly the historically Black Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, have yet to fully recover from the profound and lasting impact of the disaster.</p>

          <p>Major UK banks, including NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays, saw their share prices fall sharply following a proposal for a new windfall tax on their profits. The left-leaning think tank IPPR suggested the tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to compensate taxpayers for losses incurred from the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The proposal argues that flawed policy design has led to a multi-billion-pound government subsidy for commercial banks. While the Treasury has not commented, the speculation has unsettled investors, raising concerns about the future profitability and dividend payouts of the UK's financial sector.

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly preparing a second, British record bid of at least £120 million for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, but the deal is part of a complex transfer chain. Isak's potential move to Anfield is contingent on Newcastle first securing two replacement strikers. Newcastle is close to signing Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart and is actively pursuing Brentford's Yoane Wissa. Brentford, in turn, is targeting Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund as a replacement for Wissa. This interconnected series of moves must align before the transfer window closes for Isak's desired transfer to Liverpool to be finalized.</p>

As a potential candidate for Fed Chair, his comments reinforce his belief that lower rates are necessary, highlighting a more aggressive stance on monetary easing compared to some of his colleagues.
