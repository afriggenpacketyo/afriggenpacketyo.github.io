          <p>Water companies in the UK have admitted that self-monitoring of sewage pollution levels is damaging public trust and are advocating for a new, independent third-party monitoring system. The industry body, Water UK, is proposing this change as part of a submission to the government's review of the water sector. This comes after incidents of misreporting by water companies, including Southern Water, which was fined Â£213m for manipulating sewage data and causing environmental harm. A report from the National Audit Office also suggests the Environment Agency lacks the capacity for increased monitoring.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are appealing to President Trump after FEMA denied the state's request for federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. They argue that the storms caused catastrophic damage and federal assistance is crucial for rebuilding. This follows similar denials of FEMA requests from Washington and North Carolina. Trump has previously criticized FEMA, suggesting states should handle disaster relief independently, and issued an executive order to review the agency.</p>

The Economic Daily warns that excessive competition, including unsustainable policies to attract businesses and excessive price wars, leads to resource waste and stagnation.

The meetings occurred as Trump announced tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts, a move supported by the United Auto Workers union.

Western states were previously the most affected, but poor air quality is now shifting east.

          <p>Moises Sandoval Mendoza, convicted of the 2004 murder of Rachelle OâNeil Tolleson, was executed in Texas. Mendoza apologized to the victim's family before the execution. Evidence showed he took Tolleson from her home, leaving her infant daughter alone, before sexually assaulting and murdering her. His attorneys' request to halt the execution was denied by the Supreme Court. The victim's mother stated that the execution could not undo the loss of her daughter.</p>

          <p>Geoscientists have discovered a magma cap beneath Yellowstone National Park, which likely plays a crucial role in preventing a massive eruption. The "volatile rich" cap traps pressure and heat, but data suggests it is actively releasing gas in a stable state. Researchers used seismic imaging and computer modeling to determine the composition of the cap, which consists of silicate melt and supercritical water bubbles within porous rock. This discovery offers clues to future activity in Yellowstone's volcanic system.</p>

The order seeks to make it easier for universities to choose their accreditors and for new institutions to become accredited. This move is part of Trump's broader effort to reshape US universities, which he believes have been corrupted by left-wing ideologies, and follows actions to strip funding from universities and pressure them to change academic programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new chief federal prosecutor in Los Angeles plans to pursue immigration charges against a man awaiting release from state prison for a 2021 crash that killed a couple. The driver, Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano, pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. Federal prosecutors intend to charge him with illegally reentering the country after previous deportations, potentially leading to a 20-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Ukraine to accept a peace plan that heavily favors Russia, granting Russia control over the territory it has gained in the war. The proposal would block Ukraine from joining NATO and may recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected the plan, calling it a violation of Ukraine's constitution. Trump has responded by criticizing Zelenskyy and stating that he is prolonging the conflict.</p>
