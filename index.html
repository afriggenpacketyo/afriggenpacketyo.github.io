          <p>Google is contesting the Justice Department's proposal to break up the company, arguing that such a move would hinder the U.S.'s ability to compete with China in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence and compromise national security. The DOJ's proposal includes divesting the Chrome browser unit and opening search data to rivals, which Google claims would impede AI development and subject product design to government regulation. Google lost a separate antitrust case last week regarding online advertising monopolies. Meta and Amazon are also facing similar antitrust scrutiny from federal regulators.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its 2025 U.S. growth forecast from 2.7% to 1.8%, citing the negative impact of President Trump's newly imposed "reciprocal" tariffs. These tariffs, along with retaliatory measures from other trading partners, are expected to create major economic headwinds. The IMF also increased its estimate of recession odds in the U.S. to 40%. Furthermore, the IMF revised its expectations for headline inflation for advanced economies, including the U.S., upwards to 2.5% for 2025, reflecting an increase of 0.4 percentage point from January's projection.</p>

          <p>Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a likely Democratic gubernatorial candidate, recently attended Al Sharpton's National Action Network convention and defended Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Ford praised companies supporting DEI and suggested the term "woke" is a badge of honor, arguing that critics of "wokeness" aim to keep people ignorant and complacent. His comments come amid a broader push by President Trump to eliminate DEI from the federal government and a trend of companies moving away from such policies. Sharpton has called for boycotts of companies abandoning DEI.</p>

          <p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth stated that the company does not foresee an impending recession in the U.S., despite the negative impact of President Trump's tariffs on oil demand expectations. Wirth acknowledged that growth may be slowing, but Chevron is not altering its capital spending plans in response to recent price drops. He noted that U.S. onshore oil production, particularly in the Permian Basin, could decrease if prices fall to $60 per barrel. While Chevron anticipates minimal direct impact from the tariffs on its business, the company is monitoring the macroeconomic effects on global trade and growth.</p>

          <p>At least five people have been killed after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists visiting Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack, described as unusually large for recent years, prompted a response from India's Prime Minister Modi, who vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Security forces have been deployed to the scene, and a search is underway. While no group has claimed responsibility, the attack occurred in a region with a long-running insurgency, though violence has waned in recent years.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has rebounded above $90,000, reaching its highest level since March, as investors seek refuge in cryptocurrency amid stock market volatility and a weakening U.S. dollar. This rise coincides with President Trump's pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, demanding immediate rate cuts. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin experienced significant inflows, suggesting renewed investor interest. Analysts note bitcoin's decoupling from traditional risk assets, with its correlation to equities decreasing. However, they also caution that the recent strength has been accompanied by light trading volumes.</p>

          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that Donald Trump's attacks on NPR and PBS are a predictable continuation of his anti-media playbook, aimed at controlling the political narrative and undermining fact-based news sources. Trump has labeled public media as "radical left 'monsters'" and is reportedly considering eliminating federal funding. While NPR receives a small percentage of its funding directly from the federal government, smaller member stations rely heavily on this support. Sullivan contends that public funding is crucial for maintaining a diverse and independent news ecosystem, especially as media ownership becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of corporations and billionaires.</p>

          <p>China has launched a plan to promote the use of the yuan and its own payment system, the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), in international trade. This initiative aims to reduce China's reliance on the U.S. dollar amid escalating trade tensions. Shanghai will play a key role in enhancing CIPS functionality and expanding its global coverage, particularly in trade with countries in the Global South. This move would allow Beijing to strengthen its position in global trade networks and mitigate potential disruptions from U.S. actions curtailing access to the dollar-based financial system.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing of the tour company owner after the deaths of four people in a paddleboarding accident in Pembrokeshire, family members of the victims shared emotional statements in court. The owner, Nerys Bethan Lloyd, admitted to manslaughter after the deaths of Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley in 2021. Family members described their grief and anger, accusing Lloyd of negligence and lack of remorse. The court heard that the paddleboarders were navigating hazardous conditions and that Lloyd was unqualified to lead the tour.</p>

          <p>Climate change is threatening the $100 billion fishing industry in the U.S. as rivers are warming and losing oxygen, impacting fish populations. Brian Sheppard, a fly fishing guide on the Beaver Kill River in New York, notes that the water temperature is frequently above the threshold for good fishing, making it harder to make a living. Nonprofit organizations are working to restore river flow by removing old dams and reinforcing banks to combat the effects of climate change. Preserving the river is about introducing people to a way that their life can improve and exposing them to the magic of this place so that they'll save it.</p>

          <p>William Turner, one of the greatest Romantic painters, is celebrated 250 years after his birth. Known for his masterful interplay of light, color, and atmosphere, Turner found inspiration in nature and his travels throughout Europe.

Turner is regarded as a pioneer of modernism, a forerunner of abstract art, and the father of Impressionism, inspiring artists like Claude Monet and Camille Pissaro.</p>
