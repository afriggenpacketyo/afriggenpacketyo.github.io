          <p>Lesotho, a small African nation, is facing a 50% tariff on its imports to the U.S., the highest rate imposed by President Trump's new tariffs.  The country's economy is heavily reliant on textile exports to the U.S., and the tariffs threaten significant job losses.  The Lesotho government plans to engage with U.S. officials to address the situation and diversify its trade relationships.  The high tariff rate highlights the controversial methodology used to calculate the reciprocal tariffs.</p>
