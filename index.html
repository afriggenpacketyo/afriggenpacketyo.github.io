          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted successful strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, with all planes safely returning. The strikes involved a full payload of bombs dropped on the primary site, Fordow, which is buried deep underground and heavily defended. The U.S. communicated to Iran that these strikes are the extent of their planned actions, with no regime change efforts intended. House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed before the strikes, which followed Iran's pledge to retaliate against any U.S. involvement in the ongoing conflict with Israel.</p>

          <p>A severe storm system swept across the upper Midwest, resulting in three fatalities in Enderlin, North Dakota, due to a tornado. The storm brought torrential rains and wind gusts exceeding 100 mph to northern Minnesota, causing flash flooding and widespread damage in Bemidji, where a state of emergency was declared. Itasca State Park also sustained significant damage, leading to closures, while tens of thousands of customers in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are without power. The storm cleanup is occurring amidst dangerous heat conditions, with heat warnings and advisories affecting nearly 150 million Americans across the Midwest and Northern Plains.</p>

          <p>A hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in Praia Grande, Brazil, resulting in the deaths of eight people and injuries to thirteen others. The fire started in the balloon's basket, causing the pilot to attempt an emergency landing, during which some passengers jumped out. The company responsible for the balloon flight, Sobrevoar, stated it complied with all regulations and is suspending operations, while President Lula da Silva expressed solidarity with the victims' families. The crash occurred in an area known as the "Brazilian Cappadocia," a popular destination for hot air ballooning due to its scenic canyon landscapes.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear weapons program. Gabbard testified in March that the U.S. intelligence community assessed Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, but Trump asserted that Iran was "very close to having one." This disagreement arose as the White House indicated Trump would decide within two weeks whether to join Israel in strikes against Iran, later announcing that the U.S. had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. Gabbard defended her testimony, claiming media outlets took her words out of context, while Vice President Vance suggested circumstances had changed since her March testimony.</p>

Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days, with the Trump administration seeking his deportation due to his role in campus protests against Israel. Judge Fabiarz ruled Khalil was not a threat or flight risk, calling his detention an attempt to punish him for anti-Israel speech, while Representative Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of First Amendment rights.

Cunningham's actions, resulting in a brawl and ejections, highlighted the ongoing concern that Clark is not receiving equal protection from referees, especially after controversial incidents where Clark was roughed up by opposing players. Former NBA player Joakim Noah had previously suggested the Fever acquire a player to protect Clark, and Cunningham's popularity has surged as fans view her as Clark's "enforcer", which she has earned, in part, due to her black belt in Taekwondo.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Judge Indira Talwani ruled the policy change, which capped indirect costs for universities at 15%, was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually, threatening critical work in AI, cybersecurity, and semiconductors. This ruling follows similar blocks against funding caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

          <p>Iran's Fordo nuclear facility has been a significant concern for international monitors and experts due to its underground location and suspected role in clandestine nuclear weapons efforts. Despite Iran's claims that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, Israel asserts that Iran is close to developing nuclear weapons and that Fordo is central to those efforts. The facility's location deep within a mountain makes it difficult to destroy, potentially requiring the U.S.-produced GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) delivered by a B-2 bomber. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts, heightening concerns about the lack of transparency at Fordo.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on nuclear sites in Iran, a DW report highlighted the Fordo facility, secretly installed by Iranian leaders in the early 2000s near the city of Ghom. The facility is largely underground, protected by deep tunnels, making it difficult to target, and it is capable of producing purer grades of uranium. International intelligence services revealed the existence of the site in 2009, and the IAEA announced in 2012 that scientists at Fordo had begun enriching uranium up to 20% for medical purposes. While smaller than Natanz, Fordo's capabilities make it militarily significant.</p>

The move comes amid speculation about whether the Trump administration would use the Massive Ordnance Penetrator to target Iranâ€™s deep underground uranium enrichment facility in Fordrow.

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law, making it the largest state to impose such a mandate. The bill, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to face legal challenges from critics who argue it violates the separation of church and state, similar to a blocked Louisiana law. The law requires schools to post a 16x20 inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, which supporters say are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents argue it infringes on religious freedom.</p>

          <p>NPR's Frank Langfitt reflects on covering both a military parade and a 'No Kings' rally on the same day, noting the stark contrast between the events. The military parade featured tanks and armored personnel carriers rolling through Washington D.C., while the 'No Kings' rally protested the politicization of the armed forces. Langfitt describes the experience as akin to examining America through a lens he had often used for other countries, observing the deep political and cultural divisions within the nation. These events served as a Rorschach test, highlighting the contrasting views and values present in American society.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran war entered its second week with additional strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan, while Iran warned the United States against military intervention. Israeli strikes aimed at centrifuge production sites, coupled with targeted attacks killing senior Iranian commanders, intensified the conflict. Despite Iranian missile attacks, Israel's defense minister claimed the military had eliminated a significant portion of Iran's launchers, while a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed that several U.S. citizens were lightly wounded in an Iranian missile strike. As the conflict escalates, the U.S. began assisting with evacuations of Americans and green card holders from Israel.</p>

Receptionists at Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham describe the intense demand and verbal abuse they sometimes face, highlighting the frustration of patients unable to book appointments. The Labour government's plan to end the early morning phone "scramble" with increased funding and online appointment systems aims to alleviate the pressure.

          <p>A BBC article examines the prevalence of social media advice promising quick fixes to lower cortisol levels, warning against their effectiveness and potential harm. Experts caution that these 'quick fixes' often fail to address the root causes of stress and may prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment. Instead, they recommend tackling the underlying causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes, while also emphasizing the importance of consulting medical professionals for sudden body changes. Experts suggest that simple fixes on social media are not going to sort that.</p>

New recruits would receive the bonus after completing training and serving for two years, while former armed services personnel would be offered Â£20,000 to return for two additional years.
