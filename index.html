          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, the Trump administration announced over $90 billion in private investments from major technology and energy firms aimed at developing Pennsylvania's artificial intelligence sector. The plan includes building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub to train workers, leveraging the state's natural gas and nuclear resources. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event featured numerous industry leaders and administration officials, who framed the initiative as a way to create tens of thousands of jobs and establish a new economic era for the region. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon in the state, though the summit also drew protests from environmental advocates.</p>

          <h2>Senate Advances Trump's Request to Cut Billions in Foreign Aid and Public Broadcasting Funds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 21:45:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has narrowly advanced a White House request to cancel $9 billion in previously approved funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The measure cleared a key procedural hurdle with Vice President JD Vance casting two tie-breaking votes after three Republican senators joined Democrats in opposition. To secure support, the administration agreed to remove cuts to the PEPFAR global AIDS program. However, some Republicans, like Senators Murkowski and Collins, remain opposed, citing a lack of detail on the impacts and a desire to legislate through a more standard process rather than repeated rescissions packages. The amended bill must now pass the full Senate and be reconciled with the House.</p>

          <h2>Speaker Johnson and Other Republicans Urge Attorney General to Clarify Stance on Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 21:42:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly explain the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation files. This follows Bondi's previous comment that an alleged "client list" was on her desk, a statement the Justice Department later walked back, causing frustration among some Trump supporters. Several other prominent Republicans, including Representatives Tim Burchett and Thomas Massie, are also pushing for greater transparency, with some calling for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress. The calls for disclosure create a rare point of public divergence between the Speaker and the President on this highly sensitive issue.</p>

          <p>The White House reportedly ordered the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the nation's largest public utility, to fire its CEO, Don Moul, or be fired themselves. This ultimatum follows President Trump's intervention in a dispute over a proposed TVA gas plant near Nashville, which was opposed by country music star John Rich. The TVA board resisted the demand, arguing in a letter that Moul's performance aligns with the administration's energy dominance goals. Sources suggest the move may be a pretext for the administration to install a more politically allied CEO and potentially pursue the privatization of the massive government-owned utility.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old California teacher and high school basketball coach, Drew Hall, was found dead in Sequoia National Park one day after being reported missing. Hall had separated from his hiking group with plans to meet up later but failed to appear. He was described as fit and active but was traversing a notoriously rugged area near Sawtooth Peak. His body was discovered by friends and family who were part of the search effort. This marks the fifth fatality in the park this year, highlighting a challenging season for search and rescue teams who have conducted 60 operations so far.</p>

The Pentagon stated the move was possible because "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding."

Newsom responded to the partial withdrawal by calling for the remaining forces to be sent home, stating they were being used as "political pawns."</p>

Furthermore, nearly one-third of those surveyed have U.S.-born children. The findings challenge the perception that recent immigration sweeps primarily target new arrivals, instead showing that many of those affected are deeply integrated into American society and the Southern California economy, working in sectors like construction, landscaping, and factory production.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering effort to save Florida's coral reef, marine scientists are crossbreeding native Elkhorn coral with a hardier variant from Honduras. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral, a critical species for reef structure, has been lost due to warming oceans, disease, and coastal development. Researchers hope that the resulting "Flonduran" hybrid will be more resilient to marine heatwaves. The first batch of these crossbred corals was recently planted on a wild reef near Miami, a project that required international cooperation and special permits to transport the coral fragments. If successful, this initiative could be scaled up to help protect Florida's coastline from storm surges.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service is facing questions over its management of a wildfire that destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 70 other structures on the North Rim. The fire, started by lightning on July 4, was initially allowed to burn for several days under a "confine and contain" strategy for ecological benefit. However, hot, windy conditions caused the fire to erupt, growing nearly eightfold in one day and forcing immediate evacuations. Arizona's governor has called for a federal investigation into the decision-making process, questioning the choice to manage the fire as a controlled burn during a hot, dry summer. The North Rim is now closed for the remainder of the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks in countries with domestic gold production are increasingly buying the metal directly from local mines rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to bolster reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. This approach is also often cheaper, supports local industry, and helps formalize the small-scale mining sector. Countries like Ghana, the Philippines, and Colombia are among those using this method to build up their gold holdings as the metal's price soars and its appeal as a hedge against geopolitical risk grows.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted the unpredictable nature of earnings season, describing recent stock movements as "terrifying" for investors. He celebrated correctly anticipating a surge in Nvidia's stock after the White House allowed the company to sell its chips in China. However, he expressed disappointment with the performance of BlackRock and Wells Fargo, whose stocks fell despite what he considered to be relatively strong positions. BlackRock's miss was attributed to lower net inflows, while Wells Fargo's stock dropped after the bank cut its guidance for net interest income, a move Cramer believes management was unprepared to explain.

          <p>Los Angeles County has agreed to a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted based on shaky witness testimony, despite having an alibi and wearing a cast that would have made firing a gun difficult. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022. The settlement resolves his federal lawsuit, which claimed sheriff's detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and used suggestive questioning techniques during the initial investigation.</p>

          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man serving a life sentence for the 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback, has died of throat cancer at age 67. Murdoch was convicted in 2005 of shooting Falconio and attempting to kidnap his girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape. He always maintained his innocence and never revealed the location of Falconio's body, an act of silence that authorities say denied the family closure. Under a "no body, no parole" law, Murdoch would have been ineligible for parole without disclosing the body's location. Police have reiterated a large reward for information leading to the discovery of the remains.</p>

          <p>A Tampa, Florida woman spent six days in jail after a dispute with her homeowners association (HOA) over lawn care and other minor violations escalated. Irena Green was taken to court by her HOA for issues including dry grass, a small dent in her garage door, and a cargo van parked in her driveway. After a judge gave her 30 days to fix the problems, Green missed a subsequent court date, claiming she never received the notice, which led to a contempt of court charge and her arrest. The case highlights the significant power HOAs can wield and how quickly civil disputes can intensify when court orders are not followed.</p>

          <p>TV chef Si King, of the Hairy Bikers, has made his first visit to the site of the Sycamore Gap tree since it was illegally felled in September 2023, an act he described as murdering a "sentinel of time." King, who is from the region, said he was too angry and devastated to return sooner, calling the landmark an "exclamation mark of who we are." The visit was filmed for a BBC documentary, during which a visibly emotional King inspected the stump and the new green shoots growing from it. He noted that had the tree still been standing, he would have visited it to reflect on the recent passing of his best friend and co-star, Dave Myers.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to distinguish them from doctors and concluded they should not be diagnosing patients. The author found that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles led to them sometimes filling doctor vacancies without appropriate supervision. The recommendations aim to provide clarity for patients and healthcare teams, though the doctors' union believes the review should have gone further.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the historic ironwork, and making the building net-zero in emissions by replacing gas boilers with heat pumps. Opened in 1848, the Victorian glass house and its humid indoor rainforest require significant restoration. The project also necessitates the complex task of moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad that weighs over a tonne and is older than the Palm House itself.</p>

The ad for its cucumber, mint, and magnesium drink also referenced other "calming" ingredients like L-theanine and ashwagandha. The ASA ruled that these claims were not on the official register of permitted health claims for food and drink products and implied the drink could treat anxiety, which is prohibited.

Smith accused Cameron of treating the vote like "some sort of Eton game" and called it "unforgiveable" that such a fundamental question was put to the public without a clear plan for either outcome. He argued that critical issues, particularly the Irish border, should have been addressed beforehand. Smith, who served as chief whip under Theresa May during the tumultuous post-referendum period, described it as a "pretty disastrous" time for the country.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for treason, South Korea has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated authoritarian President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim, who was a longtime friend of the president, claimed he acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, while prosecutors at the time argued it was a simple power grab. The retrial was granted after Kim's family argued his original military trial was unjust and involved torture. The case re-examines a pivotal moment in South Korean history and forces a modern reflection on two deeply polarizing figures: the dictator credited with economic growth and the assassin some view as a patriot.</p>

The accusation, which Trump attributed to a Fannie Mae investigation, was strongly denied by Schiff, who labeled it a baseless act of political retribution and an attempt to distract from the Epstein files controversy. A Fannie Mae memo reviewed by The Times did not accuse Schiff of fraud but noted "possible occupancy misrepresentation." Schiff's office stated he has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and Maryland and followed all legal requirements.</p>
