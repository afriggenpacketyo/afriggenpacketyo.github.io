            <p>The Trump administration asserted it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S., despite court orders. This claim followed El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's statement at the White House that he would not voluntarily return Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported. Joseph Mazzara of the Department of Homeland Security stated that DHS cannot forcibly extract an individual from a foreign nation's custody. The administration maintains Abrego Garcia is a gang member, despite his lawyers' denials, creating a complex legal and diplomatic standoff. Optimism score: 10</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S., contradicting earlier suggestions that El Salvador's cooperation was the only obstacle. Attorney General Pam Bondi initially said it was up to El Salvador to return Garcia, but Bukele dismissed the idea as preposterous. The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation was an administrative error, but maintains Garcia's alleged gang affiliation. The Supreme Court ruled the administration must facilitate Garcia's release, but the executive branch is finding ways to circumvent this. Optimism score: 10</p>

Bessent's influence reportedly swayed Trump by highlighting the bond market's negative reaction to the tariffs.
