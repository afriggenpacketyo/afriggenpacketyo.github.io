          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued an emergency temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children back to Guatemala. The ruling came just hours before the children were scheduled to be flown out of Texas, following legal action by advocates who argued the plan circumvented U.S. laws designed to protect vulnerable minors. The government contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, but the judge cited the hurried nature of the plan in her decision to grant the 14-day order.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to expand its immigration enforcement operations in Chicago by deploying additional resources. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the move, which follows the controversial use of National Guard troops in other cities for similar purposes. The plan has been met with strong opposition from local and state leaders, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has described the potential deployment of troops as an "invasion" and has vowed to take legal action if the federal government proceeds without coordination.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 at Anfield, dealing an early blow to the title aspirations of their expected rivals. A late, magnificent free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in the 83rd minute was the deciding factor in a largely cautious and tactical game. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative approach was criticized, as his team struggled to create significant scoring opportunities against a resilient Liverpool defense. The result extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 Premier League games, raising questions about their ability to overcome top opponents away from home.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's plan to launch a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, calling on all citizens to resist the move. Pritzker stated that deploying troops on American streets is unacceptable without a true emergency and accused the administration of acting secretly and dangerously without coordinating with local officials. In response to the federal plans, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has already signed an executive order barring city police from assisting with civil immigration enforcement, aiming to protect residents' constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>A new tropical storm, named Kiko, has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, located over a thousand miles from the Mexican coast. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm poses no immediate threat to land but is expected to intensify in the coming days. Forecasters predict Kiko will strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday as it moves westward across the ocean. Currently, its maximum sustained winds are at 40 mph, just above the threshold for a tropical storm, making it the eleventh named storm of the season in the Eastern North Pacific.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order that would mandate identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move widely expected to face immediate legal challenges on constitutional grounds. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, with no explicit power given to the president in this area. This initiative is part of Trump's broader push for voting reform, which includes a desire to ban most mail-in voting, stemming from his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue such laws disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and disabled voters.</p>

This tragic death highlights growing concerns over declining vaccine uptake, with health officials noting that none of the main childhood vaccines in England met the 95% target last year. Vaccination during pregnancy is a key strategy to provide passive immunity to newborns before they can receive their first jabs at eight weeks old.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including four valuable tickets sold in Massachusetts. One ticket sold in Worcester won $1 million, and three others across the state each won $50,000. The next drawing on Monday night will be the 40th since the jackpot was last won in May, making it the largest prize offered in the game since April 2024.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels have raided the offices of the UN's World Food Programme and UNICEF in Sanaa, Yemen, detaining at least one UN employee. The raids occurred as the Houthis increased security across the capital following an Israeli airstrike that killed their prime minister and several other senior officials. The UN agencies confirmed the incidents and stated their immediate priority is the safety of their staff. This action is the latest in a series of crackdowns by the Houthis on international organizations operating within the territories they control.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore stated he has no interest in fighting with President Trump but will continue to fight for his communities, amid an ongoing dispute over crime in Baltimore. The feud escalated after Trump threatened to send the National Guard to the city, which he called a "hellhole," and Moore responded by inviting him on a public safety walk. In an interview, Moore called the president's criticism arrogant and cynical, arguing that Baltimore is a great American turnaround story that needs federal support, not performative actions like deploying troops not trained for municipal policing.</p>

          <p>During an informal meeting in Copenhagen, EU foreign ministers discussed a range of new measures to bolster support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia. Among the ideas floated were the potential for secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. These brainstorming sessions aim to find innovative and impactful ways to sustain Ukraine's defense efforts as the war continues with no clear end in sight.</p>

          <p>An article in The Economist reports that the Trump administration is exploring ways to exert influence over America's public universities, an issue that has gained prominence following campus protests. The piece suggests that potential actions could target institutional funding, research grants, and policies related to free speech and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This focus on higher education aligns with a broader conservative movement critical of what it perceives as ideological bias on campuses. The potential for federal intervention represents a significant new front in the ongoing culture wars surrounding American academia.</p>

          <p>In an effort to quell widespread anti-government protests, Indonesia's president has announced that political parties have agreed to cut back on certain state-funded perks for politicians. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. President Prabowo Subianto said some allowances would be reined in and a moratorium on overseas trips would be imposed. However, protest leaders have indicated these concessions may not be enough to address their broader demands.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past 13 years, a non-profit called the Bay Foundation has led an effort to smash nearly 6 million voracious purple sea urchins that had decimated the kelp forests, clearing over 80 acres of seafloor. This manual intervention allowed the fast-growing giant kelp, known as the "sequoias of the sea," to make a remarkable comeback. The restored forest now provides critical habitat for hundreds of species and serves as a model for similar conservation efforts globally.</p>

          <p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has sharply criticized a federal appeals court decision that ruled most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal, calling it "weaponized partisan injustice." Navarro warned that if the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The 7-4 decision found that Trump overstepped his authority by using a 1977 law to impose sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs on a global scale. The administration is optimistic about its chances on appeal and is casting the legal battle as pivotal for the nation's economic future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has announced a significant shift in climate policy, pledging that her party, if elected, would remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea. The plan aims to "maximise extraction" to get "all our oil and gas out," with Badenoch arguing that current climate measures lead to higher energy bills for households. The move reverses the UK's legally binding commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and has been condemned by the current Labour government and environmental groups as reckless and environmentally damaging.</p>
