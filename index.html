          <p>The trial for Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, began with an unusual opening statement from the defendant, who is representing himself. Routh's philosophical musings led the judge to reprimand him and ultimately suspend his remarks. Prosecutors presented their case, outlining evidence including cellphone data and eyewitness testimony, while the first day saw testimony from a Secret Service agent who discovered Routh at the scene and a civilian who followed the suspect's vehicle after he fled. The proceedings highlighted the defendant's unconventional legal strategy against the serious charges.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament denied a request from Swedish MEP Charlie Weimers to hold a minute of silence for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in Utah. Parliament President Roberta Metsola cited procedural rules, stating that such tributes must be formally submitted at the opening of a plenary session, which had already passed. When Weimers attempted to use his speaking time for silence, he was cut off, prompting protests from right-wing lawmakers. The decision drew criticism, with some MEPs highlighting a perceived hypocrisy compared to past tributes for other public figures.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, political figures from across the American political spectrum issued statements condemning the act of violence. President Donald Trump mourned Kirk as a close ally and blamed inflammatory rhetoric for the attack, while former Presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton also decried the killing. The event sparked tense moments in Congress, where a call for prayer was met with partisan arguments over gun control. The widespread condemnation highlighted a rare moment of unity in denouncing political violence, even as underlying partisan tensions remained evident.</p>

His father expressed frustration with the pace of the investigation, which is currently being handled by the local Pershing County Sheriff's Department. The sheriff's office has made public appeals for information but has not released details about the circumstances of the homicide.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The ruling determined he attempted to illegally remain in power following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The court also barred him from running for public office until 2033, a decision that has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life imprisoned.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in England report a growing number of children are starting reception year lacking fundamental skills, such as using the toilet independently or speaking in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers revealed that 92% have observed a decline in speech and language abilities among new students over the past two years. Experts suggest increased screen time and social isolation may be contributing factors, leaving schools to address developmental gaps before effective academic teaching can begin. This trend poses a significant challenge to the government's goal of improving school readiness levels by 2028.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed provides five key tips for parents dealing with fussy eating, a common developmental stage for many children. She advises allowing children autonomy by letting them choose whether to eat, which can counterintuitively encourage them to try more foods. Other strategies include avoiding labeling foods as 'good' or 'bad,' making mealtimes enjoyable and social, being mindful of natural appetite fluctuations, and involving children in food preparation to foster familiarity. These approaches aim to reduce mealtime stress and build a healthier long-term relationship with food for the child.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," marks a strategic shift for the pop star following the commercial underperformance of his last two introspective records. The new work incorporates cultural and musical influences from Asia and the Middle East, featuring instruments like the sitar and collaborations with Indian artists such as Arjit Singh. While the album aims to create joy and explore new sounds, some critics note that these influences are often assimilated into his familiar brand of frictionless pop rather than defining the tracks. The album represents Sheeran's attempt to reclaim his chart dominance by blending his signature style with global sounds.</p>

During a closed briefing, national security officials acknowledged this detail, raising new questions among members of Congress about the legality and justification for the attack. The Trump administration has defended the strike as an act of self-defense against members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which it designates as a terrorist organization. However, several senators are demanding more information, arguing the action may be an overreach of executive authority.</p>

          <p>The assassination of 31-year-old conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a debate over his polarizing political legacy, particularly among young Americans. Supporters remember him as a bold defender of Christian and conservative values who gave them a voice, while critics recall his provocative and often controversial views on social issues. Despite their political disagreements, many, including left-wing commentators, have unequivocally condemned the violence that took his life. The tragedy has prompted a broader conversation about the dangers of political violence and the importance of civil discourse, a principle Kirk himself often championed.</p>

          <p>Denmark has transformed its cancer care over the past 25 years, offering valuable lessons for the UK's National Health Service. Facing poor survival rates in the 1990s, Denmark initiated a long-term, politically unified strategy focused on major investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting aggressive treatment timelines, and improving the patient experience. This approach significantly boosted survival rates, surpassing the UK in several cancer types. Key elements of the Danish model include a right for patients to seek treatment elsewhere if targets aren't met and a focus on community-based care, such as at-home chemotherapy.</p>

          <p>The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has fired Kevin Struthers, a senior director of music programming who had been with the institution for 30 years. This dismissal is the latest in a series of staff changes since President Trump became the center's chair in February and appointed Richard Grennell as its new president. Struthers was the administrative director for the center's jazz programming, whose future is now uncertain following the earlier departure of its artistic director, Jason Moran. The changes have raised concerns about the artistic direction of the beleaguered arts institution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans have voted to change chamber rules to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's executive branch nominees. The new procedure allows for non-cabinet level nominees to be considered and confirmed in batches, rather than through individual votes, thereby reducing the minority party's ability to delay appointments. Majority Leader John Thune argued the change was necessary to restore standard practice and allow the president to assemble his team efficiently. Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, criticized the move as a capitulation to the executive branch rather than a genuine effort to end obstruction.</p>

          <p>The Original Pantry, a historic 24-hour diner in downtown Los Angeles that closed in March, is set to reopen after being acquired by real estate developer Leo Pustilnikov. The deal was made with the support of the hospitality union Unite Here Local 11, ensuring that all 25 laid-off employees will be rehired and union representation will continue. The diner, a beloved city landmark since 1924, was abruptly shuttered by its former owner, the Richard J. Riordan Trust, following a labor dispute.

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby predicted that Spirit Airlines is headed for collapse, stating that the ultra-low-cost carrier business model is no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby argued that the model, which relies on low base fares and numerous fees, is disliked by customers and unsustainable in the current market. Spirit Airlines recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year amid weak demand and high costs. Kirby's comments reflect a broader industry challenge for discount airlines as larger carriers successfully compete with their own basic economy offerings.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in Maine are warning residents about the invasive hammerhead worm, a destructive pest originally from Asia that preys on essential earthworm populations. The toxic worm, which can cause skin irritation, has been migrating north along the East Coast. Authorities advise against squishing or cutting the worms, as this can cause them to multiply through regeneration. Instead, they should be captured and frozen for 48 hours or drowned in soapy water. The spread of invasive species like the hammerhead worm poses a significant threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>

The attack, which killed five Hamas members and a Qatari officer, occurred in a country that hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region and had allowed Hamas a presence at Washington's request. Gulf leaders are questioning the value of their defense partnerships with the U.S., feeling that the security umbrella they pay for does not protect them from actions taken by another key U.S. ally, Israel.</p>
