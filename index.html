          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have increased significantly, with police targeting "unscrupulous" employers who exploit undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested over 6,400 people in the past year during raids on businesses, a 51% increase from the previous year. The government is cracking down on illegal migration, tightening work visas and addressing overstaying issues. The Home Office reports that many migrants face squalid conditions, minimal pay, and inhumane working hours due to exploitation by these employers.</p>
