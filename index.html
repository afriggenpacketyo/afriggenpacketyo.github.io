          <p>Japan and the United States have reported positive developments in their ongoing tariff negotiations, as indicated by Akazawa. The discussions likely centered on Tokyo's proposals to import more American agricultural products, with the Japanese delegation seeking further details from the United States regarding its priorities. This comes amidst broader economic uncertainty stemming from U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump, which the Bank of Japan is factoring into its growth and inflation outlooks. Japan has been urging Washington to reconsider these policies, adding complexity to the trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's Superintendent of Schools, Ryan Walters, is pushing for students to submit their immigration status during school enrollment, intending to share the data with federal authorities in support of President Trump's deportation plans. This proposal has sparked controversy, drawing criticism from students and teachers, with protests held in response. Governor Kevin Stitt opposes the plan, replacing members of the State Board of Education in response to Walter's proposal and arguing that the Trump administration isn't seeking the immigration status of students. The White House clarified that it's not a directive to enter schools but to prevent undocumented immigrants from taking refuge there.</p>

          <p>Kohl's Corporation terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan for cause after an external investigation revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest with a vendor. The investigation found Buchanan directed the company to engage in transactions involving a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, failing to disclose this connection as required by the company's code of ethics. He also caused the company to enter into a multi-million dollar consulting agreement involving the same individual. Michael Bender, the board chair, has been appointed as interim CEO to revitalize the business, which is facing challenges due to sluggish sales and competition from Walmart and Amazon.</p>

The decision to move the marathon, which involves over 25,000 runners and significant city resources, was made due to logistical challenges of hosting both events on the same day, as the Oscars are held near the marathon route.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is departing from his role as National Security Advisor, with President Trump planning to nominate him as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim National Security Advisor, concurrently holding his current position. The decision to replace Waltz stemmed from concerns about vetting NSC staff and the Signal chat incident where sensitive information was disclosed to a journalist. Despite these issues, Trump respects Waltz and offered him a high-profile new role. The Senate will need to confirm Waltz for the ambassador position, with some senators predicting a challenging confirmation hearing.</p>

          <p>Sammy Hagar expressed his frustration with David Lee Roth, recounting their co-headlining tour in 2002 where Roth allegedly caused problems by frequently canceling shows at the last minute. Hagar, who replaced Roth as the frontman of Van Halen in 1985, stated he had to step in to perform on those nights to avoid disappointing fans. He also criticized Roth's performance style during the tour, suggesting he should have presented himself more as a solo artist rather than replicating his 1983 Van Halen show. Hagar emphasized his own successful solo career before joining Van Halen and his commitment to only performing songs he can confidently sing well.</p>

Transgender rights advocates have criticized the assessment as ideologically driven, misrepresenting medical consensus, and potentially endorsing conversion therapy.

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and other constitutional violations. They argue that Mangione faces concurrent state and federal prosecutions in New York and separate charges in Pennsylvania, which infringes on his rights. Attorneys also challenge the terrorism upgrade added by the Manhattan district attorney's office, arguing the evidence doesn't prove Mangione intended to intimidate a civilian population or influence government policies.

The show will tour the UK after its run in Salford, but unlike the free access to original portraits in London, this exhibition charges admission.

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism for changes to maternity funding levels, with campaigners questioning his commitment to maternity safety. Following a report on poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, almost £100m was invested annually to improve maternity safety. However, recent changes mean only £2m of that funding is guaranteed for maternity care this year. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have condemned the decision, fearing it will undermine efforts to improve maternity safety. The Department of Health maintains that local health leaders will be given the money to decide how best to spend it.</p>

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border continue to be at historically low levels three months into President Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown. In April, Border Patrol recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions of migrants crossing the border without authorization, consistent with the previous two months. These figures represent a significant decrease compared to the Biden administration, with some detainees being flown to Guantanamo Bay and El Salvador. The Trump administration's policies, including rapid deportations and increased troop deployment, are credited with driving the decline in illegal entries.</p>

Homeless advocates criticize the timing, arguing it prioritizes logging over the needs of vulnerable individuals. The US Forest Service says the closure restricts all access while crews operate heavy machinery and conduct prescribed burns. A restraining order to stop the closure was denied by a judge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, potentially increasing prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. The "de minimis" exemption, which applied to parcels worth less than $800, allowed these companies to ship goods directly to the US without duties or import taxes. Both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, argued that the loophole damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods. The closure aims to tackle the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and will subject packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to import duties.</p>
