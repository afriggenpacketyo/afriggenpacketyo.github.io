          <p>Police have initiated a corporate manslaughter investigation into alleged failings at maternity units in Nottingham. The investigation comes after concerns were raised about the care provided at these units, leading to tragic outcomes for some families. Authorities will be looking into potential systemic issues and whether negligence contributed to the deaths of babies. The investigation aims to determine if the hospital trust is criminally liable for the failings in care. </p>

          <p>In the wake of Kamala Harris's defeat, Democrats are engaged in a debate over whether their political and policy mistakes stem from flawed messaging or deeper issues with their governance. Some argue that the party's failure to deliver material improvements in areas like housing and infrastructure has undermined their credibility. A recent poll suggests that voters prefer populist rhetoric focused on corporate power over technocratic arguments about supply-side bottlenecks. However, the article argues that Democrats do not need to choose between these approaches, as policies promoting abundance can be compatible with redistributing wealth and power. </p>

The city's policy differs from that of Hiroshima, which indicated it would include Taiwan on the list of participants for its memorial event.

Additionally, it notes that Ukraine and Russia are scheduled to meet for a second round of talks as attacks escalate. Finally, the article touches on the U.S.'s dependence on China for rare earth magnets, which is causing shortages, and the closure of a 355-year-old company that once owned one-third of Canada. </p>

          <p>A GOP-friendly group, Americans for Prosperity, is investing $4 million in advertising to garner support for President Trump's tax agenda in the Senate. The campaign aims to persuade Republican senators to support the bill, which includes extending key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill also includes Medicaid work requirements and a raise of the debt ceiling, which could face political challenges in the Senate. The advertising includes testimonials highlighting the impact of the 2017 tax cuts and encouraging fiscal hawks to eliminate wasteful spending. </p>

Opponents, including environmental and labor groups, contend that the changes would restrict community groups' ability to shape development and reduce the polluting effects of projects in vulnerable neighborhoods. </p>

          <p>California is on the verge of implementing a sweeping bill that would mandate phonics-based reading instruction in schools, marking a significant shift in the state's approach to literacy education. The proposed law, backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, aims to address California's persistently low reading scores by requiring districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading." This approach emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The bill has garnered support from teachers unions and advocacy groups after compromises were made to provide districts with more flexibility in selecting instructional materials. </p>

          <p>Experts argue that California's proposed ban on plants near homes to reduce wildfire risk may be misguided. Well-maintained plants and trees can help protect homes from wind-blown embers and slow the spread of fire. The state's plan for an "ember-resistant zone," prohibiting almost all plants within 5 feet of homes, could face public resistance. Research suggests that well-watered plants can act as heat sinks, absorbing energy and blocking embers, thus reducing fire risk. </p>
