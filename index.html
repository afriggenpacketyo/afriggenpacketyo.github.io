          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and key European leaders are set to hold virtual discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump. The talks, hosted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, aim to caution Trump against compromising Ukraine's sovereignty ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Concerns are high that Trump might pressure Ukraine into an unfavorable peace deal, as he has previously suggested territorial concessions from both sides to end the war. The meeting underscores European apprehension about being excluded from the direct U.S.-Russia negotiations.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is projected to become the first hurricane of the season. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts it will strengthen by late Wednesday and likely reach hurricane status by Thursday. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, with early models showing it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, where at least eight people were killed.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry announced it had warned and "drove away" the USS Higgins, a U.S. destroyer, for allegedly entering its territorial waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal without permission. Beijing accused the U.S. of infringing on its sovereignty and undermining regional stability. The U.S. Seventh Fleet refuted China's statement as false, asserting the warship was conducting a routine freedom of navigation operation in accordance with international law. The incident highlights the ongoing military and territorial tensions in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Madonna has made a public appeal on social media, urging Pope Leo XIV to visit Gaza to bring attention to the suffering of children in the war-torn region. In her message, she emphasized the need for humanitarian aid and stated she was not taking sides in the conflict but was focused on preventing children from starving. Her plea comes as aid organizations and the UN report growing malnutrition among children in Gaza due to Israel's blockade and distribution issues. The Pope has also recently called for an immediate ceasefire and respect for humanitarian laws.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision, allowing Arkansas's first-in-the-nation ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for minors to be enforced. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited a recent Supreme Court ruling on a similar Tennessee law, agreeing that the ban does not violate the equal protection rights of transgender youth. Arkansas officials praised the decision as a protection for children from "experimental procedures." The ACLU, representing the families who challenged the law, condemned the ruling as a "tragically unjust result" that harms transgender Arkansans.</p>

          <p>London's status as a global financial hub faces significant challenges, including high inflation, persistent economic friction from Brexit, and increased competition from New York and Frankfurt. The city has seen a sharp decline in fundraising from initial public offerings, and business uncertainty remains high, according to the Bank of England's governor. Despite these issues, recent interest rate cuts and new trade deals outside the EU offer some hope for recovery. Policymakers are being urged to focus on growth policies and create a more attractive environment for business and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' lead in the National League West has been completely erased after a crushing 7-6 walk-off loss to the Los Angeles Angels. A go-ahead ninth-inning home run by Shohei Ohtani against his former team seemed poised to be a turning point, but the bullpen once again failed to hold the lead. The Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth and won it in the tenth, marking the Dodgers' third consecutive loss and 20th in 32 games.

          <p>Lawyers for California and the Trump administration are in court arguing over the legality of deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The state contends the deployment violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, and has caused "anxiety and fear" among residents. The federal government argues the troops were legally deployed under Title 10 to protect federal property and personnel during protests, claiming no laws were broken. The trial is examining whether the president has the authority to declare a "rebellion" to justify such a deployment.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is a significant threat to Ukraine, not because a deal will be reached, but because Trump may adopt and legitimize Putin's false narratives. The author suggests Putin will frame the conflict in a way that appeals to Trump's ego and isolationist views, portraying Ukraine as a corrupt drain on U.S. resources. The danger is that Trump could emerge from the meeting promoting a ceasefire on terms dictated by Russia, which Ukraine could never accept. This would allow Putin to blame Ukrainian "intransigence" for the continuing war.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggling bullpen has taken another hit, with right-handed reliever Brock Stewart placed on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation. Stewart was the team's only bullpen acquisition at the trade deadline, brought in to bolster a relief corps already depleted by injuries. This news came on the same day the team announced that starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin would miss the rest of the season after undergoing elbow surgery. While the team is optimistic Stewart's injury was caught early, it adds more uncertainty to their recent slump.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance's new Vulcan rocket has successfully blasted off from Cape Canaveral on its first operational mission for the U.S. Space Force. The powerful launcher, which will replace ULA's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, carried two military satellites into a high geosynchronous orbit. One of the payloads is an experimental satellite, NTS-3, designed to test advanced navigation technology for a more resilient GPS-like system. The launch marks a major milestone for ULA as it competes with SpaceX in the national security launch market.</p>

National Guard is unique as the president, not a governor, has authority over it. Activated under Title 32, the troops have arrest powers but are currently tasked with supporting federal and local law enforcement, not acting as the primary agents. The president has also taken temporary control of the D.C. police force under the Home Rule Act, a move that can last up to 30 days unless extended by Congress.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any negotiations about Ukraine's fate conducted without its participation "will not work." His comments come ahead of a one-on-one summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy revealed that during a recent call, a U.S. envoy signaled Russia might be ready for a ceasefire, but he remains adamant that Ukraine will not withdraw forces from the occupied Donbas region. He believes the summit primarily benefits Putin, who seeks the legitimacy of a meeting with a U.S. president.</p>

An all-hands meeting with the new director was described as "insultingly insufficient," running only 12 minutes and being plagued by technical issues. Staffers noted the grim irony that the attack came after the agency's firearm violence prevention unit had been dismantled. While some leaders have been praised for their direct engagement, a broader sense of a leadership vacuum persists as the traumatized workforce tries to recover.</p>

          <p>China has initiated a year-long program to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support the economy. The plan, announced by several government financial bodies, will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on eligible loans for purchases like cars and education. The central government will fund 90% of the subsidy, with provincial governments covering the rest. Officials hope this will channel more credit into consumption and help establish domestic demand as the primary driver of the national economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is a response to Republican-led efforts in states like Texas to create maps favorable to their party. Newsom had threatened retaliatory redistricting if red states proceeded with their plans. He now intends to ask California voters to approve a new map proposal this November, which his office claims will help Democrats retake the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival rates have doubled in the last 50 years, a new study reveals that progress has been highly uneven. Cancers with the worst outcomes, such as pancreatic, oesophageal, stomach, and lung cancer, have seen little improvement and are falling further behind. For example, 10-year survival for pancreatic cancer remains below 5%. In contrast, cancers like melanoma and breast cancer have seen survival rates soar due to advances in treatment and earlier detection. Researchers and charities are calling for more investment and focus on these harder-to-treat cancers.</p>
