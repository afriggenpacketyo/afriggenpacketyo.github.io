          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed a much-anticipated agreement focused on critical minerals, establishing a joint investment fund to bolster Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. According to the US Treasury Department, this partnership signals a commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine, sending a clear message to Russia. The deal outlines how revenues from mineral exploration will be split, with the aim of attracting global investment and unlocking Ukraine's growth assets. The agreement faced delays due to last-minute changes proposed by Ukraine, but ultimately both sides finalized the terms, emphasizing transparency and traceability of funds.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged that Americans might have to do with less as a result of the ongoing trade war with China, suggesting that consumers may have fewer choices or pay slightly higher prices for goods. He argued that China has benefited significantly from trade imbalances, and the trade war aims to rectify these issues. Trump insisted that the impact would be worse for China, which relies on the U.S. market to sell its goods, and he downplayed the necessity of many imported items. Trump stated that he would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and he continued to insist that Americans do not need many of the goods that are imported from China.</p>

          <p>A court found Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, guilty of lying under oath during the Epic Games trial, accusing them of willfully violating a 2021 decision.

The judge has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings.

          <p>President Trump's trade policies are creating both challenges and opportunities across different sectors of the American economy. Soybean farmers in Wisconsin are facing uncertainty due to tariffs, with China purchasing a significant portion of their production. Meanwhile, shrimpers in South Carolina see potential benefits from the tariffs, as they struggle to compete with lower-priced imports. Major retailers have warned that continued tariffs could lead to empty store shelves, and farmers remain cautiously realistic about the future impact. Despite the uncertainty, farmers maintain resilience, hoping for a resolution to the trade disputes.</p>

          <p>An effort in the Senate to block President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs failed, with Republicans largely opposing the measure amid concerns about the economic impact. The resolution, led by Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. The vote was 49 to 49, falling short of the majority needed. The measure would not have been taken up in the House, making the vote largely symbolic. The tariffs include a 10% baseline on most U.S. trading partners and increased levies on other countries, although a 90-day pause was announced for most countries except China.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have formalized a new reconstruction and investment fund, establishing an economic agreement that grants the U.S. access to proceeds from Ukraine's reserves of rare earth minerals. This agreement aims to provide Ukraine with an implicit security arrangement while addressing President Trump's concerns about the U.S. providing a blank check. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the agreement signals a commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine, ensuring that no state supporting Russia's war benefits from Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>

          <p>Qualcomm reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by robust chip sales growth. However, the company's revenue forecast for the current quarter was slightly below estimates, causing its share price to fall in extended trading. Qualcomm's automotive business grew significantly, and its Internet of Things business also saw substantial revenue growth. The company said it does not expect any material impact from tariffs and has a diversified global supply chain to navigate uncertainties. Qualcomm's most important business is selling chips for smartphones, including high-end devices made by Samsung and Apple.</p>

The White House declined to explain why Trump did not realize the photograph he held up on social media had been altered. The administration has faced increasing scrutiny from the courts over its handling of the case and has chosen to respond by waging a war of public opinion. The president's advisers have repeatedly argued that two courts had 'ruled' that the deported man is a member of MS-13, but he has never been charged with or convicted of being a member of the gang.</p>
