          <p>The Russian military asserts that all Ukrainian troops have been expelled from Russia's Kursk region, a claim Ukraine has not confirmed. Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff for Russia's Armed Forces, reported this to President Vladimir Putin, stating the village of Gornal was the last settlement liberated. Putin congratulated the soldiers, claiming Kyiv's incursion had failed. The news comes as U.S. President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy met in Vatican City and agreed to continue negotiations later, with Lavrov stating that the Kremlin is 'ready to reach a deal' with the U.S. on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of deporting a two-year-old U.S. citizen along with her mother without due process, raising concerns about the White House's crackdown on documented immigrants and citizens. Judge Terry Doughty scheduled a hearing for May 19 to investigate the deportation of the girl, referred to as VML, who was apprehended with her mother by ICE. The ACLU has described VML's case as a shocking abuse of power, noting it violates ICE's directives regarding the care of minor children. Trump has expressed interest in deporting violent criminals who are US citizens to El Salvadoran prisons, alarming civil rights advocates.</p>

          <p>A conscious parenting coach identifies the phrase 'you're okay' as a potentially harmful response to children's emotional distress, arguing that it invalidates their feelings and hinders emotional processing. The phrase can teach children to doubt their emotions, suppress their experiences, and believe that love is conditional upon emotional control. Over time, this can rewire a child's stress response and create difficulties in trusting, regulating, and expressing emotions. Instead, parents are encouraged to validate and support their children's feelings.</p>

The project is focused on decreasing both legal and illegal immigration into the US. While Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025 during the election, he has implemented policies aligned with its spirit, including slashing federal staffing and budgets.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identifies the 10 worst-paying college majors five years after graduation, highlighting that not all degrees guarantee high salaries, particularly in liberal arts fields. Graduates with degrees in education, social work, and the arts tend to earn the lowest median incomes, falling below the U.S. median wage. While engineering majors can earn upwards of $80,000 early in their careers, many liberal arts and education majors earn closer to $40,000. The median salary of all majors examined was $50,000.
