            <p>The government of El Salvador has rejected a request from four Democratic lawmakers to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was wrongly deported. The lawmakers sought to meet with Abrego Garcia after Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit, but were denied access because they were not in El Salvador in an official capacity. Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his family, was deported to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison despite a court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration alleges he is a member of MS-13, which his wife and attorney deny, while the State Department reports he is in good health at a different penitentiary.</p>

            <p>AI companies are offering free or heavily discounted access to their advanced chatbots for college students, reminiscent of the "Millennial lifestyle subsidy" of the 2010s. OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, and Perplexity are among the companies providing these deals, hoping to hook young users on their tools and foster long-term dependency. However, this strategy is costly, with OpenAI reportedly losing millions on free usage and facing significant burn rates. While students gain convenience and assistance with studies, there are concerns about potential misuse and the long-term implications of relying on AI for tasks and advice.</p>

            <p>A federal court in Denver heard arguments in a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, specifically targeting Venezuelan migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that providing only 24 hours' notice before deportation is insufficient and violates due process rights. The ACLU of Colorado argues that alleged Nazis were afforded more rights after World War II than Venezuelans currently facing deportation. The Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations, raising questions about the legal rights of migrants challenging government allegations.</p>

            <p>Following a fatal crash involving Xiaomi's SU7 electric vehicle, China's automotive association is urging EV makers to improve driving safety and avoid exaggerating the capabilities of self-driving systems. Carmakers should enhance product safety designs and develop effective warning systems for drivers. The government has also warned companies against using terms like "autonomous driving" in promoting current driver-assistance systems, as most systems require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. The fatal Xiaomi crash occurred while the car was traveling at 116km/h with the driver-assistance system engaged.</p>

Harvard President Alan Garber argues the funding freeze will impede critical scientific and medical research. The Trump administration's actions follow Harvard's rejection of demands to change policies and leadership, including auditing for "viewpoint diversity."</p>
