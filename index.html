          <p>A key witness in a high-profile China spying case in the UK reportedly removed the word "enemy" from his statement, aligning it with the Conservative government's policy at the time. This detail has emerged amid accusations that the current Labour government is responsible for the case's collapse. According to a letter from a deputy national security adviser, the decision not to label China an "enemy" was made under the previous government, which complicates the political blame game. The case against two men accused under the Official Secrets Act was dropped because prosecutors could not secure evidence from the government describing China as a national security threat.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming segments. Despite the positive results, the company noted that overall sales volume was flat, indicating that inflation-weary consumers are stretching their budgets and reducing purchases in some categories like home and health care. P&G's CFO mentioned that while the consumer environment is stable, there is a noticeable slowdown in the U.S. market, with lower-income shoppers in particular cutting back. The company maintained its full-year forecast, though it faces ongoing challenges from a complex geopolitical and consumer landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The portrayal of 'aliens' in popular culture has historically mirrored societal anxieties, from Cold War-era communist infiltrators to modern-day refugees, reflecting a deep-seated human tendency to project fears onto 'the other.' This article explores how depictions have evolved from classic sci-fi tropes to more introspective themes, noting that the term itself carries connotations of exclusion in debates on migration. The concept of the alien is now being applied to artificial intelligence, which some experts describe as a non-biological, alien mind we have created. This framing suggests our discomfort with AI stems from a similar fear of the unknown that has long shaped our stories about extraterrestrial visitors.</p>

          <p>The official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army, the PLA Daily, published an editorial stating that political loyalty and combating corruption are essential for China's military to win wars. The statement follows a Communist Party conclave that endorsed an ongoing anti-corruption campaign within the armed forces. The editorial emphasized that the military must not be a sanctuary for corrupt individuals and called for strict adherence to political guidance. This push for integrity is framed as a critical component of accelerating the development of advanced combat capabilities and modernizing military governance to enhance overall war-readiness.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals How Wealthy Americans Exploit Tax Loopholes to Build Dynastic Fortunes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The modern U.S. tax system, designed to be progressive, is failing to effectively tax the wealthiest Americans, who utilize sophisticated strategies to avoid both income and estate taxes. Billionaires often avoid taxable income by taking minimal or no salaries, instead building wealth through untaxed stock appreciation and using those assets as collateral for loans. This allows vast fortunes to grow untaxed and be passed down through generations, undermining the estate tax, which has been weakened by loopholes and political pressure. This tax avoidance playbook exacerbates wealth concentration, creating what the article, an excerpt from a book by Ray D. Madoff, describes as a new American aristocracy and posing a threat to democratic principles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has dismissed concerns about Mohamed Salah's recent dip in form, stating that the winger's goal-scoring ability is the 'last thing' he worries about. Salah, who was the team's top scorer last season, has only scored three league goals this term and was benched for a recent Champions League match. Slot attributed the slow start to various factors, including squad changes and the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, which may have disrupted on-field connections. Despite Salah's longest Premier League goal drought from open play since 2017, the manager remains confident that the Egyptian star will soon return to his prolific scoring ways.</p>

The trip would have been the first by a minister from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government. A German Foreign Office spokesperson expressed regret over the development, which comes amid heightened tensions over several issues, including Germany's stance on Taiwan. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson had recently criticized Germany's position, and it remains unclear if this was directly linked to the scheduling difficulties. The situation is further complicated by new Chinese export controls on rare-earth technology and a dispute over a Chinese-owned chipmaker in the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced an immediate halt to all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an advertisement sponsored by the province of Ontario that was critical of his tariff policies. The ad featured a quote from former President Ronald Reagan arguing that tariffs ultimately harm American workers and consumers. Trump condemned the ad as 'FAKE' and 'egregious' on social media, declaring the talks 'HEREBY TERMINATED.' This move escalates trade tensions between the two nations, which have been strained by U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports, particularly impacting Ontario's car and steel industries.

James and her legal team have vehemently denied the charges, calling them a 'baseless' and politically motivated act of revenge by President Trump.

          <p>An AI-powered gun detection system at a Baltimore high school mistakenly identified a student's bag of Doritos as a firearm, prompting a police response. The student, Taki Allen, was sitting outside the school eating a snack when officers approached him with guns drawn, handcuffed him, and conducted a search. The alert was triggered by an image where Allen was holding the chip bag with two hands and one finger out, which the AI system interpreted as a weapon. This incident highlights the potential for error in automated security technologies and caused significant distress for the student involved, leading the school to offer counseling support.</p>

The driver initially fled the scene but later returned and abandoned the vehicle, which had multiple bullet holes.

          <p>India's largest private refiner, Reliance Industries, is reportedly stopping its purchases of Russian crude oil after the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russia's state-owned oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.

This move could negatively impact the company's profit margins, as it will likely need to source more expensive oil from other regions like the Middle East or the Americas. While analysts believe the financial impact is manageable, the decision marks a notable shift in India's energy trade dynamics following increased Western pressure on Moscow.

The article contrasts this with more violent robberies, suggesting the world should appreciate the blithe nature of this particular caper. By highlighting the museum's security lapses and the thieves' clumsy getaway, the piece suggests the event reinforces, rather than damages, France's cultural image.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have dismantled a sophisticated, high-stakes poker fraud scheme allegedly run by La Cosa Nostra crime families that cheated victims out of at least $7 million. The 'mind-boggling' operation used advanced technology, including X-ray tables, hidden cameras, and pre-marked cards readable with special contact lenses, to rig underground games. Prominent figures, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and former NBA player Damon Jones, were allegedly enlisted as 'face cards' to lure wealthy gamblers into the games. The investigation led to over 30 arrests, revealing a complex plot to finance criminal enterprises through the elaborate deception of unsuspecting players.</p>

          <p>The price of gold remains a key indicator for investors, often viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of economic instability and a hedge against inflation. As of October 23, 2025, the price stood at $4,131.47 per ounce, but this figure is subject to constant change based on a variety of influences. Key factors driving gold's value include global supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Additionally, movements in the U.S. dollar and the policies of central banks, which hold significant gold reserves, play a crucial role in the precious metal's market performance.

          <p>German law enforcement agencies are facing increasing pressure from a surge in synthetic drugs, including amphetamines, ecstasy, and new psychoactive substances like ketamine and potent opioids. In 2024, police seized over 1,800 kilograms of these substances, more than triple the amount from the previous year, with officials warning about labs capable of producing tons of drugs in weeks. The Federal Interior Minister highlighted the dramatic rise in cocaine and synthetic drug trafficking, noting that smugglers are adapting with new routes and methods. This trend poses a significant public health risk, especially from highly potent opioids like fentanyl and nitazene, which can be fatal even in tiny doses.</p>

García-Hernández was an undocumented immigrant who was shackled in a government van when a gunman, reportedly targeting ICE officials, opened fire. Gauffeny, who gave birth to their third child just days after her husband's death, believes the current anti-immigrant political climate contributed to the tragedy. She described the pain of telling her children their father is gone and now faces an uncertain future, struggling with their new mortgage and the loss of her husband, who was in the process of legalizing his status.</p>

Critics argue that accepting funds, including a $10,000 anonymous donation, from individuals with cases or proposals before the board could violate state ethics laws.

This discovery marks only the fifth confirmed impact crater in China and the very first to be found in the country's southern region.

The primary concerns driving this pessimistic outlook include potential depreciation of the U.S. dollar and a slowdown in profitable exits from private equity and venture capital investments.

          <p>The new film 'Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere' portrays the creation of the 1982 album 'Nebraska' as a deeply personal exorcism of childhood trauma, focusing on the artist's fraught relationship with his father. However, this article argues that by framing the album solely through an autobiographical lens, the movie diminishes the broader artistic and cultural significance of the work. 'Nebraska' was not just about personal pain but was also a profound engagement with American musical traditions like folk, blues, and rockabilly, as well as national myths of outlaws and working-class struggle. The film's focus on paternal conflict ultimately undersells the album's rich tapestry of influences and its unique place in Springsteen's catalog.</p>

The administration claims the project will be funded by private donations, a list of which includes major tech companies and crypto investors with business interests before the government.

For Labour, the third-place finish in a historic stronghold is a devastating blow, reflecting deep unpopularity and prompting calls for a new strategy. Meanwhile, Reform UK's strong second-place showing demonstrates its growing influence, even as it failed to secure a win, setting the stage for a highly competitive political environment in Wales.</p>

          <p>Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials' was famously controversial for its anti-religious themes, but his new companion series, 'The Book of Dust,' explores a different kind of dangerous idea: post-truth moral relativism. In the new trilogy, the heroine Lyra becomes estranged from her soul after being influenced by books that claim nothing is real or meaningful. This article reflects on how Pullman, once a target of religious censorship, is now writing about the genuine danger of certain philosophies, particularly those that serve powerful capitalist and state interests by rendering a populace confused and compliant. The series suggests that the antidote is telling true, embodied stories, echoing the ongoing cultural battles over which ideas and values should be shared with children.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, economists are debating its potential to tip the economy into a recession. Some experts warn that a long-term impasse could create a 'vicious cycle' where furloughed workers exhaust savings, critical food assistance is cut, and a lack of federal economic data fosters uncertainty, chilling consumer and business confidence. Each week of the shutdown is estimated to reduce annualized GDP growth by about 0.1%. However, other economists downplay the threat, arguing that most federal spending is on autopilot and the direct impact is limited to a narrow segment of the economy. They believe the resilient U.S. economy can withstand the headwind without severe spillover effects.</p>
