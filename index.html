          <p>Tens of thousands attended a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona, where Donald Trump delivered a speech blending eulogy with campaign rhetoric. Trump acknowledged Kirk's desire to love his opponents but stated he himself preferred to "hate" his, a departure from the somber tone. Vice President JD Vance also spoke, describing Kirk as a "martyr for the Christian faith" and framing the event as a revival. The service highlighted Kirk's significant influence within the MAGA movement and conservative politics.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are set for a mixed start to the week as investors await China's decision on its loan prime rates, which are expected to remain unchanged. Futures for Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 indicate a higher open, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng is poised to be flat. The cautious sentiment follows a strong week on Wall Street, where the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs after the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, which has markets pricing in additional cuts this year.

Quarterback Justin Herbert led a late drive, connecting with Keenan Allen for a game-tying touchdown before setting up kicker Cameron Dicker for the 43-yard game-winner as time expired. The victory moves the Chargers to a 3-0 start for the first time since 2002. However, the win was tempered by a potentially serious Achilles tendon injury to running back Najee Harris.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state, a symbolic but significant move aimed at reviving peace efforts. The coordinated announcement was met with strong opposition from Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a "reward for terror" and vowing a Palestinian state would not be established. The leaders of the three nations framed the decision as a necessary step toward a two-state solution and not an endorsement of Hamas. This development adds to the more than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a study of over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who practice specific behaviors early on. These include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than intervening in every conflict, these parents provide space for problem-solving. They also validate their child's feelings and treat mistakes as learning opportunities, creating an environment of emotional safety that is foundational for strong social development.</p>

This commitment comes after the government scrapped a previous plan to cut disability benefits. With the health and disability benefits bill forecast to reach £100 billion by 2030, McFadden insists that reform is essential for both individuals and the national budget.

          <p>A team of scientists is developing a novel approach to fight Lyme disease on Nantucket island by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population. The project, led by an MIT biologist, aims to make the mice—the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria—immune to the disease. This "heritable immunization" would be passed down through generations, breaking the transmission cycle where ticks feed on infected mice and then spread the illness. The project is proceeding with extensive community consultation to address ethical and ecological concerns before any potential release of the engineered animals.</p>

          <p>Millions of monarch butterflies undertake a mysterious and arduous migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific mountain forest in Mexico each year. This journey is accomplished by a unique "super generation" of monarchs that live up to nine times longer than their peers, allowing them to complete the 3,000-mile flight. Scientists are still studying how multiple generations instinctively navigate to the same remote location. However, the monarch population has declined significantly due to habitat loss, prompting conservation efforts like planting milkweed to support their epic lifecycle.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has said he would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure." In an interview with the BBC, Lee described this as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the immediate goal of complete denuclearization, given that Pyongyang produces numerous new weapons annually. This marks a pragmatic shift in policy, aimed at reducing immediate threats while keeping the long-term goal of denuclearization alive, reflecting a desire to re-engage in stalled talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government hopes will stimulate economic growth. The plan involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport projects job creation and economic benefits, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions. The expansion is a significant development for UK aviation infrastructure.</p>

The man's daughter reported that shortly after kickoff, her father's "signs of life" began to fade. Other fans in their section immediately called for help, and a nurse in the crowd rushed over to perform life-saving CPR. The family expressed immense gratitude for the "embrace" of the Bills Mafia community. The fan is now recovering in the hospital and is awaiting a pacemaker.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced the formal recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a major shift in British foreign policy intended to support a two-state solution. The move, coordinated with allies like Canada and Australia, was framed as a step toward peace, not a "reward for Hamas." The decision has drawn sharp criticism from the Israeli government and some UK opposition figures, who argue it rewards terrorism. Conversely, Palestinian officials welcomed the move as a correction of a historic wrong, highlighting the deep divisions surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old female mountain lion, known as F390, was fatally struck by a vehicle in Southern California, leaving her two 14-month-old cubs to fend for themselves. According to the UC Davis California Carnivores Program, the cubs were still dependent on their mother for learning crucial survival and hunting skills. Researchers have since successfully placed a GPS tracking collar on the female cub to monitor her progress. The incident highlights the significant threat that road traffic poses to the state's mountain lion population, whose habitats are increasingly fragmented by development.</p>

The incident serves as a reminder of how unsecured trash can attract wildlife into developed areas as their natural habitats shrink, creating potentially dangerous encounters for both animals and humans.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, currently located northeast of the Philippines, has intensified to become the most powerful storm on the planet so far in 2025. The storm reached sustained winds of 270 km/h, making it a Category 5-equivalent cyclone. Its strength is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures and minimal wind shear. Satellite imagery shows a well-defined, symmetrical storm. Ragasa is expected to maintain its peak intensity for a short period before gradually weakening as it moves toward the South China Sea.</p>
