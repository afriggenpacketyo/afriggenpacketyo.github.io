          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh achieved a significant milestone by hitting his 54th home run of the season, equaling Mickey Mantle's 1961 record for a switch-hitter. This powerful accomplishment helped the Mariners secure an 11-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels, propelling them into sole possession of first place in the American League West. Raleigh, who also expressed humility and a strong focus on team success, contributed to the Mariners' impressive ninth consecutive win as they aim for their first division title since 2001. His manager praised his overall performance, defensive skills, and leadership with the pitching staff, underscoring his immense value to the team's championship aspirations and his humble way of making history.</p>

          <p>The FBI arrested Adeeb Nasir, 58, and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir, 31, in Utah after an incendiary device was discovered under a FOX 13 News vehicle in Salt Lake City. The device, found lit but non-functional, was deemed a significant threat to public safety due to its nature and placement. A subsequent search warrant executed at the suspects' residence uncovered hoax weapons of mass destruction, firearms, bomb-making equipment, and illegal drugs, leading to charges including Threat of Terrorism. Authorities highlighted the potential for mass casualties and are holding the suspects without bail as the investigation continues into their motives.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, citing his commitment to a safe and affordable New York City and his focus on economic accessibility. Despite past disagreements, Hochul expressed confidence in Mamdani's leadership, particularly his shared goal of confronting the agenda of former President Trump. This endorsement from a moderate governor is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has recently moderated some of his past stances, including apologizing for a 2020 social media post critical of the NYPD. The move aims to unify the Democratic party and secure funding for key policy proposals.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high, extending its gains for the tenth consecutive session, after the government announced it would abandon plans to raise taxes on stock investments. This positive market movement occurred as investors also monitored ongoing U.S.-China trade discussions in Spain and processed new economic data from Beijing. While Hong Kong and China saw mixed trading with China's economy slowing, the broader context of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the U.S. fueled hopes and contributed to the positive sentiment in some Asian markets. This policy reversal is expected to encourage further investment in the South Korean stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has formally questioned Sir Keir Starmer regarding the extent of Downing Street's awareness of Lord Mandelson's connections to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In a letter, Tory MP Alex Burghart demanded the release of documents related to Mandelson's appointment as U.S. ambassador and evidence of No 10's reaction to his Epstein ties. This follows Mandelson's sacking after reports of supportive emails sent after Epstein's sex offense conviction, leading to accusations of "appalling judgment" against the Prime Minister. The scandal has prompted criticism from some Labour MPs and calls for greater transparency and accountability within the government.</p>

Supporters argue it will combat impersonation and address concerns about federal immigration enforcement tactics.

Despite a rise in small business bankruptcies among farmers, many in rural America, a key Trump voting bloc, remain loyal, believing the tariffs will yield long-term benefits. Experts note that rural support for Republicans predates Trump, fueled by a sense of alienation from urban liberals.

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common cognitive symptom often linked to stress or busy lifestyles. While not a medical condition itself, it signals mental fatigue or overwhelm, and can affect anyone. Dr. Tharaka, a medical expert, offers four practical tips to combat it, emphasizing the importance of recognizing it as temporary and not a personal failing. Strategies include deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities to allow the brain to reset and reduce lingering stress, effectively creating "mental buffers." If concerns persist or symptoms are severe, consulting a GP is recommended for further evaluation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting $58 million from Congress to enhance security for the executive and judicial branches, prompted by the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. These funds, if approved, would be directed to the U.S. Marshals Service and bolster protection for Supreme Court justices, who face a heightened threat environment. The White House also expressed support for increased security funding for congressional lawmakers, who face a significant rise in threats, with over 14,000 expected by year-end. This request comes ahead of a critical government funding deadline, underscoring urgent concerns for public officials' safety across all branches.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is reportedly not cooperating with Utah investigators, according to Governor Spencer Cox.

Robinson, an inactive unaffiliated voter with no prior violent offenses, will face official charges on Tuesday. Ammunition found with the weapon was engraved with anti-fascist messages, including "Hey, fascist!

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond is facing intense scrutiny following the firing of head football coach DeShaun Foster after just five wins in 15 games. Critics argue Jarmond mishandled the previous coaching change with Chip Kelly and then made an unqualified hire in Foster, who had no prior head coaching experience. The article, an opinion piece, contends that Jarmond has steered the football program into a "steaming wreckage," damaging its national reputation and financial standing. It questions whether Chancellor Julio Frenk should allow Jarmond to make a third coaching hire, despite his successes in other sports.</p>

A moderate Republican, Edgar later grew uneasy with his party's shift rightward and supported Kamala Harris's presidential bid.

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from personnel choices rather than their 3-4-2-1 system under Ruben Amorim. Despite tactical improvements making the team more compact, individual errors, particularly in defensive midfield and at left-back, are costing them points. Murphy highlights Bruno Fernandes playing out of position as a key issue, where his defensive instincts are lacking, and Luke Shaw's discomfort in a center-back role. He concludes that unless the manager addresses these selection issues and places players in more natural roles, the team will continue to suffer from individual mistakes.</p>
