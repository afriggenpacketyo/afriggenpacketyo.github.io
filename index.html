The timeline highlights Musk's initial support for Trump, including endorsements, campaign rallies, and his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, the relationship soured after Musk's departure from the White House, marked by his criticism of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and accusations against Trump. The article also details Trump's responses, including threats to cancel Musk's government contracts and claims that Musk was asked to leave his administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a public dispute, with Trump threatening to terminate Musk's government contracts and Musk claiming Trump couldn't have won the presidency without him. The feud originated from Musk's opposition to the Republican's tax and budget bill, which he criticized as "outrageous." Musk also alleged Trump's name appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein files. Trump responded by stating Musk was "wearing thin" and claimed he had asked Musk to leave his administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has suspended the entry of foreign students at Harvard University for six months, citing national security concerns and accusing the institution of having "extensive entanglements" with foreign countries. Harvard responded by filing court documents to block the order, calling it a "retaliatory" action that violates the university's First Amendment rights. The suspension affects international students seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard. The university, which has been in a legal battle with the Trump administration over alleged antisemitism on campus, enrolls nearly 7,000 foreign students, comprising 27% of its population.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served awaiting trial. This practice extends the duration of confinement for young people, often without access to rehabilitative services. Experts argue that this disparity stems from the juvenile system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to a lopsided application of fundamental rights. The lack of time credit can result in months or even years of additional incarceration for youth.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning residents about a social media scam offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The fraudulent advertisement asks for personal information and payment through Cash App, which the DMV never uses for transactions. The DMV advises renewing registrations through the official DMV website, a DMV kiosk, or at a DMV office. This warning aims to protect residents from falling victim to identity theft and financial fraud.</p>

          <p>This article reviews three new film releases: "Ballerina," "Dangerous Animals," and "The Ritual." "Ballerina," a spin-off from the John Wick saga starring Ana de Armas, delivers spectacular fight scenes but lacks a compelling story. "Dangerous Animals" offers a suspenseful thriller with strong performances, while "The Ritual," starring Al Pacino, is a less successful horror film with an excessive accent and limited development of motivations for its cast. Pacino's return to the big screen is a privilege even if it is in a movie that is not very successful.</p>

          <p>Handwritten notes reveal Winston Churchill's concern over the slow progress of securing penicillin supplies before D-Day. The documents show the prime minister's frustration that the UK was behind the US in production despite penicillin being a British discovery. While sufficient supplies were eventually obtained, mostly from the US, they were initially only available for battle casualties. A telegram illustrates the desperate need for the drug, which was unavailable to the general public until 1946.</p>
