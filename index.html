          <p>Shares of South Korean chipmakers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics surged significantly, with SK Hynix hitting a 25-year high, after announcing a partnership with OpenAI. This collaboration, part of OpenAI's Stargate initiative, aims to boost the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI and expand data center capacity in Korea. SK Hynix is already a major supplier of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips to Nvidia, while Samsung seeks certification for its HBM4 chips. The alliance underscores the increasing demand for specialized memory in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved an all-time high, climbing over 3%, primarily propelled by the strong performance of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. These chip giants saw their shares rise after announcing a strategic partnership with OpenAI to enhance advanced memory chip production for AI. The broader Asian markets also experienced gains, with Japan's Nikkei 225 advancing and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbing. This market surge occurred despite an increase in South Korea's consumer price index and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee, a 133-year-old brand, has launched a viral marketing campaign rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously highlight the severe U.S. housing crisis. The advertisement, featuring the slogan "Maxwell House? In this economy?", offers an "affordable name" and a year's supply of coffee for "under $40." This initiative acknowledges that the median age of first-time homebuyers has reached an all-time high of 38, with fewer than 16% of homes being affordable for typical households. The campaign aims to connect with the growing population of coffee-loving renters across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of War has strongly refuted claims of an internal strategy split, asserting that the National Defense Strategy was "seamlessly coordinated" with all senior civilian and military leaders. Deputy Secretary of War Steve Feinberg dismissed reports from The Washington Post suggesting political leadership and senior officers were at odds over the strategy's priorities and tone. Officials emphasized the extensive collaboration involved in drafting the document, which aligns closely with the National Security Strategy. This pushback comes amidst broader overhauls by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, focusing on tougher standards and a tighter warfighting focus.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first individual to reach a net worth exceeding $500 billion, briefly touching $500.1 billion. This financial milestone is attributed to the soaring valuations of his ventures, including electric car manufacturer Tesla, AI startup xAI, and rocket company SpaceX. The increase in his wealth solidifies Musk's position as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of competitors like Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Tesla's shares have risen over 20% this year, partly due to investors welcoming Musk's increased focus on his companies rather than political engagements.</p>

          <p>An Idaho state judge has ruled against the public release of graphic crime scene photos from the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students by Bryan Kohberger. Second District Judge Megan Marshall determined that disseminating these "incredibly disturbing" images would cause "extreme emotional distress" to the victims' families, outweighing public interest in the investigation's conduct. The ruling mandates blacking out portions showing victims' bodies or immediate blood, though other investigative records, including videos of distraught friends, can be released. Kohberger pleaded guilty to the murders in a deal that spared him the death penalty.</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi has significantly reduced its exposure to China's September equity rally, reallocating funds towards safer dividend stocks. The firm cited lingering doubts about China's economic outlook and concerns over "overvalued" Chinese stocks, despite the CSI 300 Index's surge driven by AI enthusiasm. Amundi's deputy CIO, Philippe d’Orgeval, indicated a selective increase in onshore shares over Hong Kong-listed equities due to valuation gaps. The firm remains open to rebuilding China exposure if macro conditions become more supportive, but currently perceives a less favorable environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Previously, groups like refugees and asylees were covered, but the new act restricted access, potentially affecting 1.4 million immigrants.

          <p>Five years after launching its robotaxi service, Waymo continues to grapple with operational challenges, as highlighted by recent viral incidents. A Waymo vehicle was filmed blowing past a stopped school bus in Atlanta, and another was pulled over for an illegal U-turn in San Francisco, with police unable to issue a citation to a driverless car. Despite Waymo's claims of superior safety data, experts like former NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt argue for higher standards before widespread adoption. Waymo, owned by Google's Alphabet, acknowledges the vehicles are still learning while expanding to new cities.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, carrying aid to Gaza, detaining activists including climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Israel's Foreign Ministry stated the vessels were "safely stopped" for approaching an "active combat zone" and violating a naval blockade, while the GSF accused Israel of an "illegal" and "brazen act of desperation," alleging one vessel was rammed. The incident sparked international condemnation, with Colombia expelling Israeli diplomats and terminating a free trade agreement. This event unfolds amidst reports of famine in Gaza and ongoing efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>A boiler room explosion caused a partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, leaving a massive hole in its side. Miraculously, no injuries were reported, prompting Mayor Eric Adams to call it an "all-hands-on-deck moment" that avoided a major disaster. Initial investigations point to the explosion sending shockwaves up the chimney, causing the structural failure. Residents were evacuated, and inspections are underway, with the building having active violations for unsafe facades dating back to 2020. The incident highlights concerns about the structural integrity of older public housing.</p>

Sanders, a former college star, was considered a potential first-round pick but fell to the fifth round.
