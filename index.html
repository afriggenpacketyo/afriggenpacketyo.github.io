            <p>A small Cessna 310R plane crashed in Boca Raton, Florida, shortly after takeoff from Boca Raton Airport, killing all three individuals on board. The aircraft, experiencing mechanical issues, went down on Military Trail, also impacting a car on the ground. A man in the car sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was treated at the scene. Witnesses reported seeing the plane flying extremely low and appearing to struggle before crashing into railroad tracks and causing a fireball. The FAA and local officials are investigating the incident, with thoughts and prayers extended to the families affected.</p>

            <p>The Senate confirmed retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in an overnight vote, filling the position after President Trump's controversial firing of Gen. CQ Brown Jr. Caine's nomination faced scrutiny due to his lack of prerequisite experience as a combatant commander or service chief, though this was waived by the president. Despite some Democratic opposition, citing concerns about Trump's intentions, the vote was bipartisan. Caine has pledged to provide candid and apolitical advice to Trump, disputing claims of wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and vowing to resist illegal orders.</p>

            <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported a glitch in the system used by freight shippers to claim tariff exemptions, creating confusion amidst fluctuating tariff policies. The glitch affects the entry code required to exempt freight from tariffs, including shipments from China and nations under the 90-day pause implemented by the Trump administration. While CBP works to resolve the issue, importers are advised to file cargo release forms separately from financial papers, leading to delays in tariff collection. The uncertainty adds to business anxiety, with some companies pausing expansion plans due to the unpredictable trade environment.</p>

He expressed concerns about the impact on farmers, customers, and business owners, noting the challenges already faced by the coffee industry due to climate change and supply constraints. Adjusting to changing trade policy requires time and resources, forcing small businesses to explain price changes to customers and potentially affecting personal income and reinvestment.</p>

            <p>Republicans in Congress are investigating a Biden-era green energy grant program, the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), amid concerns that funds were allocated to climate groups with ties to Democrats and former President Joe Biden's allies.

            <p>The Justice Department informed a federal judge that it could not provide requested information about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, citing the impracticality of the judge's deadline. The DOJ stated that it is reviewing the Supreme Court's order and evaluating next steps, arguing that foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines. Abrego Garcia's attorneys criticized the DOJ for delaying and flouting court orders, emphasizing the risk to his life and safety. The case highlights the ongoing legal battle over Abrego Garcia's deportation and the government's response to the court's directives.</p>
