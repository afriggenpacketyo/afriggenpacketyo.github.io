          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a significant IT outage, leading to a nationwide ground stop for both its own flights and those of its regional carrier, Horizon Air. The issue, attributed to a primary data center failure rather than a cyberattack, resulted in over 229 flight cancellations. While operations have since been restored, the airline anticipates further disruptions as it works to reposition aircraft and crews across its network and has implemented a flexible travel policy for affected passengers. This marks the second major IT-related disruption for the airline this year.</p>

          <p>Citizens of the Republic of Ireland are voting to elect their next president, a largely ceremonial but constitutionally significant role, for a seven-year term. The main contest is between independent candidate Catherine Connolly, who is backed by a coalition of left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys of the governing center-right party, Fine Gael. The election follows the completion of President Michael D. Higgins's two terms in office. The race has been notable for the withdrawal of several other candidates, including one amid a rent controversy.</p>

          <p>Two federal judges, Julien Xavier Neals of New Jersey and Henry Wingate of Mississippi, have admitted that their staff's unauthorized use of generative AI led to the release of erroneous court orders. The admissions came in response to an inquiry from Senator Chuck Grassley, who raised concerns about factual inaccuracies in the rulings. In one case, a law school intern used ChatGPT for legal research, while in the other, a law clerk used Perplexity as a drafting assistant. Both judges have since implemented stricter written policies to prohibit AI use in drafting judicial opinions.</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets saw significant gains, with South Korea's Kospi index closing over 2.5% higher to reach a new record. The regional rally was largely driven by positive investor sentiment following the White House's confirmation that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold talks next week. Japan's Nikkei 225 also climbed 1.35%, supported by the optimistic geopolitical outlook. Meanwhile, South Korea's finance ministry stated it is prepared to intervene to stabilize its currency, the won, amid recent volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The result is a major blow to Labour, whose vote share plummeted to 11%, raising concerns about their standing across Wales. Reform UK, despite high expectations, finished second, falling short of their ambition to become a dominant force in Welsh politics.</p>

This positive economic indicator comes amid broader concerns about a potential slowdown in the British economy.

          <h2>UK Government Faces Challenge in Finding Chair for Grooming Gangs Inquiry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is struggling to appoint a chair for the high-profile inquiry into grooming gangs, as the role is seen as extraordinarily difficult and controversial. Even highly experienced candidates, such as former child protection chief Jim Gamble, have ruled themselves out, highlighting the challenge of finding someone who will be accepted by all victim groups. The situation is further complicated by a dispute over whether Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips should remain in her post, with different survivor groups holding opposing views. This difficulty underscores the deep mistrust and pain surrounding the issue after years of systemic failures.</p>

          <p>According to an MSNBC report, the U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has informed the Department of Justice that she believes there is not enough evidence to bring mortgage fraud charges against Senator Adam Schiff. The investigation into the California Democrat, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, has been ongoing amid calls from the president for his prosecution. While one DOJ official reportedly denied the meeting took place, Schiff's lawyer stated that the allegations are baseless and politically motivated. The report suggests that career prosecutors have found the case against the senator to be without merit.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has finalized its plan to permit oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), a move that reopens a contentious environmental debate. The decision allows for future lease sales in the 1.5 million-acre area, which is considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich'in people but is supported by the Iñupiaq community of Kaktovik for its economic potential. This action fulfills a key promise made by President Trump and congressional Republicans to open the protected region to development. Environmental and some tribal groups have vowed to challenge the decision in court.</p>

          <p>At a summit in London, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer plans to press allied nations to increase their supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine. The meeting will include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and leaders from over 20 allied countries who have committed to providing security guarantees to Kyiv. The push for more advanced weaponry comes as Ukraine seeks to enhance its capability to strike targets deep within Russian-held territory. The UK will also announce the early delivery of 100 additional air defense missiles as part of its ongoing support for Ukraine's defense efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned "surge" of federal agents in San Francisco following a direct conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech executives.

The deployment of Border Patrol agents to the Bay Area had been met with strong opposition from local and state leaders.

          <p>Demonstrators at the recent "No Kings" rallies protesting the Trump administration have adopted a unique tactic: wearing inflatable animal costumes. The trend, which includes frogs, dinosaurs, and unicorns, began in Portland as a way to use absurdist humor to counter the narrative that the protesters are violent radicals. Organizers say the costumes make the demonstrations feel less threatening and are designed to make any government use of force appear farcical. The tactic aims to publicize a political message in a way that highlights the perceived authoritarianism of the administration's response to dissent.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is slowly moving through the central Caribbean and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane by the end of the weekend.

This heavy rainfall poses a significant risk of life-threatening flash floods and landslides across the region. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland, its slow movement over warm waters is contributing to its potential for rapid strengthening.</p>

          <p>The U.S. women's national soccer team was defeated 2-1 by Portugal in a friendly match, marking Portugal's first-ever win against the Americans in 12 meetings. The game, which also served as a farewell celebration for two-time World Cup champion Alex Morgan, saw the U.S. score just 33 seconds in before Portugal responded with goals in each half. U.S. coach Emma Hayes attributed the lackluster performance to the team's long 113-day layoff since their last match. The result was a surprising setback for the U.S. as they begin preparations for World Cup qualification.</p>
