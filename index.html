          <p>Traditional acoustic piano sales have significantly declined since 1925, impacted by modern entertainment and economic pressures on younger generations. However, the instrument is finding new life through digital and hybrid pianos, which offer more affordable and space-saving options. Experts note that digital pianos provide accurate sounds and functional keys, making them accessible for beginners. This shift is seen optimistically, with hopes for a resurgence in piano playing as people seek alternatives to screen-based activities.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of extra police officers are deployed across Manchester to reassure communities following a deadly synagogue attack that killed two Jewish men. The assailant, Jihad Al-Shamie, drove a car into people outside a synagogue and attempted to force entry before being shot by police. Six individuals have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses, with four granted extended detention. Authorities questioned the appropriateness of a pro-Palestinian march occurring shortly after the tragedy, highlighting the sensitivity of the situation.</p>

          <p>US Ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, views President Trump's Gaza peace plan as a unique chance for Middle East peace, despite the UN's criticized role in aid distribution. Waltz emphasized the need for UN reforms, particularly regarding aid interception by groups like Hamas, which he says resells it on the black market. He also highlighted the US goal of burden-sharing in international interventions, citing the Haiti gang-suppression force as an example. The ambassador underscored the importance of US engagement globally to protect its interests and values.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police made over 400 arrests in central London during protests supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action, which proceeded despite calls to postpone demonstrations after the Manchester synagogue attack. Organizers defended the timing, stating a need to grieve for both victims of the attack and Palestinians. The protests diverted significant police resources, raising concerns about security for Jewish communities. Amnesty International criticized the arrests, calling them a breach of human rights obligations.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza are experiencing a mix of hope and fear after Hamas agreed to parts of President Trump's peace plan. While hopeful for their loved ones' return, they remain wary of potential disappointments, given past failed ceasefire attempts. The families emphasize the urgent need for negotiations to bring all hostages home and secure an end to the conflict. This development offers a fragile sense of optimism for those directly impacted by the crisis.</p>

          <p>UCLA basketball player Xavier Booker is undergoing a career reboot, transitioning from power forward to center after transferring from Michigan State. Coach Mick Cronin convinced the 6-foot-11 former McDonald's All-American to embrace a traditional big-man role, focusing on post moves, rim protection, and fast-break play. Booker has gained weight and is adjusting to the physical demands, showing progress. This strategic shift aims to maximize his unique blend of size and guard-like skills, potentially transforming his impact on the team.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly being considered for a leading role on a "Board of Peace" to govern Gaza post-ceasefire, as outlined in President Trump's peace plan. This prospect has drawn significant criticism due to Blair's controversial history in the Middle East, particularly his role in the 2003 Iraq War and his previous eight-year tenure as Middle East envoy, which Palestinians criticized as favoring Israel. Despite this, Blair described Trump's plan as "bold and intelligent," offering the best chance for peace.</p>
