          <p>President Trump's announcement of new tariffs leaves several questions unanswered.  The exact tariff rates remain unclear, with analysts suggesting possibilities ranging from 10% to 60%, potentially varying by country.  The specific countries affected are also unknown, although Trump has hinted at a broad application or a focus on countries with significant trade imbalances with the US. Finally, the overall economic impact of these tariffs is uncertain, with experts warning of potential negative consequences.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil's deportation case will remain in New Jersey, rejecting the government's attempt to transfer it to Louisiana.  The judge's decision emphasizes the importance of jurisdiction based on Khalil's location at the time of the petition. This ruling prevents the case from potentially being heard by a more conservative appeals court, which could have set a precedent affecting similar cases.  The decision is a victory for Khalil's legal team, who argued the government's actions were an attempt to manipulate jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares to announce new tariffs, various options are reportedly under consideration. These include a flat 20% tariff on all imports, potentially generating trillions in revenue, and differentiated tariff rates based on reciprocal barriers imposed by other countries.  Deals with the U.S. could exempt some countries from tariffs. The final details remain uncertain, but the administration believes the tariffs will positively impact the U.S. economy despite expert warnings of potential negative consequences.</p>

          <p>Mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have resulted in significant staff reductions at the FDA, CDC, and SAMHSA.

          <p>A House hearing on the alleged “censorship industrial complex” under the Biden administration was criticized by a disinformation expert as being based on a “fiction.”  Nina Jankowicz, a former DHS official, argued that the hearing ignores the Trump administration's actions restricting free speech.  Republicans presented evidence of alleged censorship, while Democrats denounced the hearing as hypocritical and a waste of taxpayer money. The hearing highlighted the deep partisan divide on the issue of online censorship and disinformation.</p>
