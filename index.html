            <p>Shares of Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML experienced a 6% drop after the company reported lower-than-expected net bookings for the first quarter of 2025, totaling 3.94 billion euros against an anticipated 4.89 billion euros, according to analysts. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet noted that uncertainty stemming from new U.S. trade restrictions could potentially affect demand for its advanced chipmaking machines, even though the demand outlook remains strong due to artificial intelligence. The company is estimating 2025 revenue of between 30 billion euros to 35 billion euros, but analysts warn that the impacts from U.S. tariffs on ASML could be widespread, though it's too early to tell what the full effect will be.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is transferring control of a federal land strip along the U.S.-Mexico border to the Department of Defense, effectively establishing a military base that could allow troops to detain individuals, including migrants. This move aims to circumvent federal laws prohibiting the use of U.S. troops for domestic law enforcement, as the military can perform security functions on land designated as an Army base. The Department of Defense will test this approach in New Mexico by erecting fences and warning signs, with unauthorized individuals subject to arrest by military personnel, with any detained migrants to be handed over to civilian law enforcement agencies. Elizabeth Gotein, an expert on presidential powers, suggests this action is likely to face legal challenges due to its primary purpose being border security.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off as investors fled the safe-haven asset amid market turmoil caused by President Trump's proposed tariffs, leading to a surge in the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level since February. Analysts are debating who initiated the sell-off, with some suggesting China may be weaponizing its Treasury holdings by selling them and converting the proceeds into Euros or German bunds, while others point to Japanese life insurers reducing their U.S. exposure due to policy uncertainties. A rapid sell-off by China could negatively impact the value of its remaining bond holdings and appreciate the yuan, conflicting with Beijing's economic stimulus goals. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with President Trump's demands regarding governance, hiring, and teaching, leading to the administration freezing $2.2 billion in federal funds to the institution. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserted that no government should dictate the curriculum of private universities, drawing praise from alumni like former President Barack Obama. While Harvard has made some concessions to address antisemitism concerns, it drew a line at the White House's sweeping list of demands, potentially setting the stage for a prolonged conflict between the federal government and higher education institutions. With a substantial $53.2 billion endowment, Harvard is uniquely positioned to withstand financial pressure, though the loss of federal funding could still pose challenges.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies have plunged the U.S. into a series of trade wars, creating uncertainty for businesses and economies worldwide, with economists warning of potential consequences for global companies and consumers. Trump initiated a trade war during his first term, primarily targeting China with tariffs on a wide range of goods, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing. Since assuming office, President Biden has largely maintained the tariffs imposed by Trump on China, while implementing some new restrictions, adopting a more targeted approach, economists say. A timeline of events highlights escalating trade tensions, including threats of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and Colombia, as well as reciprocal tariffs and investigations into various imports, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.</p>

            <p>Ahead of the UK-wide ban on disposable e-cigarettes (vapes) scheduled for June 1, a recent study indicates a decline in their popularity, with researchers suggesting users are transitioning to refillable and rechargeable alternatives. The percentage of 16-24 year olds primarily using disposable vapes has nearly halved in the past year, dropping from 63% to 35%, according to research from University College London (UCL). The government's ban aims to address littering and rising rates of youth vaping, but health experts emphasize the importance of balancing these concerns with the need to support vaping as a means to quit smoking. Vape manufacturers are already adapting to the ban by producing rechargeable versions of their popular disposable models.</p>

            <p>As artificial intelligence drives demand for data centers, electricity infrastructure and utility costs are undergoing structural changes, potentially leading to higher utility bills for consumers. A report by the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative suggests that special contracts between utilities and data center companies could shift costs onto consumers due to their complexity and opaque regulatory processes. In the U.K., proposed reforms to the electricity market, such as zonal pricing, could favor data centers harnessing renewable energy, potentially increasing wholesale prices for residents in most of the country. Regulation and energy grid reform are crucial for managing energy prices and meeting changing energy needs.</p>

            <p>Conservationists are warning that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being pushed closer to extinction due to intense grass fires, with endangered birds like hen harriers and the UK's fastest declining mammal, the water vole, among those affected. A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March have contributed to the fires, with 110 square miles of land around the UK already burnt this year. The National Trust said it believed ongoing wildfires at Abergwesyn common in Powys had destroyed "the last remaining" local breeding habitat for golden plovers. The loss of habitat and food sources is impacting various species, leading to calls for increased funding to restore peat bogs and better oversight of controlled burns.</p>

            <p>Rafael Behr argues that President Trump's concept of "defending free speech" is a thinly veiled demand for submission to his personal prejudices and the interests of Silicon Valley oligarchs. The author criticizes the White House's attempts to influence Britain's digital regulations and trade policies, framing them as an imperial demand for market access disguised as a defense of universal rights. Behr contends that Britain should not take instruction on political freedom from a regime that suppresses media independence, undermines democratic alliances, and disregards due process, as this model of "free speech" is incompatible with genuine democratic values.</p>

The EU is planning a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, restarting negotiations to resolve a dispute over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. This shift raises the question of whether the EU is pivoting towards China, with some officials suggesting they are open to new opportunities and leveraging their market with the Chinese, while others emphasize the need to strengthen Europe independently.</p>

            <p>President Trump's defiance of a Supreme Court order to facilitate the return of a deported Maryland resident, Armando Abrego Garcia, has sparked concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. Experts warn that if the president refuses to abide by court rulings, the U.S. system of governance, including the separation of powers and an independent judiciary, is at risk. The administration's actions in the Abrego Garcia case have led some to believe that the U.S. has reached a tipping point, with the president's disregard for legal and constitutional obligations potentially undermining the foundations of democracy.</p>

            <p>The White House has implemented a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump by news agencies, particularly wire services like the Associated Press (AP). This move comes after a judge ruled that the White House improperly punished the AP for its editorial decisions, violating the organization's free speech rights. The new policy gives the press secretary greater control over who can question the president, raising concerns about potential viewpoint discrimination and limiting the ability of wire services to provide comprehensive coverage to their numerous media clients.</p>
