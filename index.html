She admitted to lying about having cancer to her in-laws and explained that she threw up after the meal, possibly mitigating the effects of the poison.

          <p>Confidence in higher education has declined over the past decade, particularly among Republicans, as recent graduates face challenges in finding well-paying jobs. While unemployment rates for recent grads are currently high, experts suggest this is due to post-pandemic economic trends rather than inherent deficiencies in college education. The college wage premium remains high, but the gap between college and high school graduates' earnings has stabilized since 2010. A study indicates that the value of college for lower-income students has decreased since the 1960s due to factors like enrollment patterns and state investment choices.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon expressed a desire for Harvard University to return to the negotiating table with the Trump administration. McMahon stated that Harvard has complied with some orders to end discrimination, including alleged DEI and antisemitic activity, but negotiations are stalled due to an ongoing lawsuit. The conflict stems from the administration's multi-agency task force on antisemitism, which froze federal funding to the institution. McMahon emphasized that antisemitism is a civil rights violation.</p>

The measures, which came into effect on Wednesday, are intended to secure the future of the American steel industry.

The UK was granted a carve-out from the measures, leaving duties on its steel and aluminum at 25%.</p>

          <p>Apple's emergency application to halt changes to its App Store resulting from its legal battle with Epic Games has been denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The ruling allows Apple to no longer charge a commission on payment links inside its apps. Apple had argued that the ruling could cost the company "substantial sums".</p>
