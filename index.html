          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a 'fool' after the central bank decided to maintain current interest rates, citing economic uncertainty related to tariffs. Trump has been advocating for rate cuts to stimulate the economy, but the Fed is hesitant due to concerns about potential inflation. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and are not influenced by political pressure. The president had previously expressed concerns about potentially firing Powell, which had unsettled markets, but later stated he had no intention of doing so.</p>

While negotiations with China have not yet formally begun, Bessent is scheduled to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation in Switzerland.

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander warns that the Trump administration's cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will create an "open season" for scammers. Lander calls on state and local governments to compensate for the gap in oversight, emphasizing that the CFPB's diminished capacity will leave Americans vulnerable to fraud and predatory lending. He highlights instances of student loan servicers engaging in unlawful activities and the CFPB dropping lawsuits against companies accused of scamming borrowers.

Zuckerberg envisions AI playing a significant role in social tasks, potentially leading to AI-generated accounts interacting with users. The app's privacy issues include the lack of an incognito mode and the recording of all user interactions, raising concerns about Meta's data collection practices.</p>

Spencer Hospital in Iowa, for example, loses $2 million per year on its psychiatric unit but remains committed to keeping it open.

The potential tariff aimed to address the shift of filmmaking overseas due to cheaper labor and tax credits. However, filmmakers argued that such a levy would halt production and could lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries. The industry prefers tax credits to lure moviemakers back to America, but that would require additional government spending.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will lower the burden of President Trump's sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum. A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of mRNA vaccines, explaining how they work, their safety, and their potential in medicine. Scientists have been studying mRNA for decades and exploring its promise in preventing infectious diseases and treating cancer and rare diseases. The mRNA vaccines work by delivering instructions to cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response, creating a memory of the protein in the form of antibodies. The vaccines have risks, but they are generally safe and effective.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs later. It's thought US President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports will stay, but that the UK will see cuts to the 25% tariffs on some of its biggest exports. The deal is likely to reduce tariffs on specific items set to be subject to higher tariffs, with cars being an important factor. There is speculation the UK could lower its 2% digital services tax on US firms in return for lower tariffs on things like car and pharmaceutical exports.</p>
