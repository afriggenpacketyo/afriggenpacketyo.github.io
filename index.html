        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices are experiencing a surge due to recent trade uncertainties, attracting investors seeking safe-haven assets, while U.S. Treasuries and the dollar decline. This shift is attributed to President Trump's trade policies, with gold stepping in as the preferred safe-haven asset. Analysts anticipate gold prices to continue rising, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce by the second quarter of 2026. The traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down as faith in America and the 'U.S. exceptionalism' narrative dwindles, further boosting gold's appeal as it is not tied to the economic or political trajectory of a single nation.

          <p>Construction has commenced for a casino resort in Osaka, near the site of the 2025 World Exposition, despite concerns regarding potential noise disruptions during the international event. The integrated resort, featuring a large hotel, conference facilities, and gambling areas, is slated to open on Yumeshima, an artificial island in Osaka Bay, by 2030. Local authorities plan to minimize the expo's impact by reducing work during peak visitor days and delaying heavy machinery operations until after the event concludes in October. This project marks Japan's first integrated resort since the legalization of casinos in 2018, aimed at boosting tourism and regional economies.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges, following allegations related to the employment of his former son-in-law at a now-defunct budget airline in Thailand. Prosecutors contend that Lee Sang-jik, a businessman who controlled the airline, provided the son-in-law with 217 million won in salary and housing allowances as a bribe to Moon. The son-in-law allegedly lacked the qualifications for the executive position he held. This indictment adds Moon to the list of former South Korean leaders facing criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States has no specific currency targets in trade negotiations with Japan, aiming to find common ground after President Trump's tariffs on imports. Bessent's statement precedes a meeting with Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato in Washington, where currency policy is expected to be a key discussion point. Japan's government has refuted claims of currency devaluation and affirms commitment to G7 agreements on currency valuation reflecting economic fundamentals. The U.S. administration prioritizes negotiations with Japan to address trade deficits, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, and government subsidies.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and Gavi vaccine alliance have jointly warned of a global increase in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, meningitis, and yellow fever.

Measles cases have risen significantly, and there has been a rise in children missing their routine vaccine doses.

Rhianon Bragg, who was stalked, felt trapped by the exclusion zone placed on her stalker, leading her and others to propose that offenders be confined to designated areas. While the Ministry of Justice emphasizes exclusion zones prevent offenders from approaching victims, concerns are raised about potential breaches of perpetrators' human rights. Victims argue the emphasis should shift from perpetrators' rights to their own safety and freedom.</p>

Speaking out against Hamas is dangerous, but some residents are undeterred, citing a wasted life between war and escalating violence. Despite Hamas' efforts to suppress dissent, including violence and abduction, some believe the group's authority is diminishing, as civilians are losing their fear and preventing military actions from inside their communities.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor, assesses the risk of a US recession in light of President Trump's tariffs, noting that several indicators suggest a downturn is increasingly likely. These indicators include an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and falling business confidence. Prediction markets are placing higher odds on a recession, and nowcast indicators show a potential fall in GDP growth. Frankel estimates the odds of a US recession as high as 60% for the coming year, cautioning that the US economy may be heading for a downturn.</p>

          <p>Chinese trend-toy maker Pop Mart is increasing prices on its Labubu character in the US and shifting more production to Vietnam due to the tariff war between the US and China. The company is introducing Labubu 3.0, priced at 99 yuan in mainland China, but will charge US$28 in the US to protect its profit margins. Pop Mart is positioned as a high-end toy brand overseas and targets adult buyers, giving it pricing power.</p>
