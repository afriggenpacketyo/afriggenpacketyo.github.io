          <p>The Tall Ships Races, one of Europe's largest free family events, has commenced in Aberdeen, Scotland, expecting to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors. The four-day festival features nearly 50 vessels from around the world, including international crews from as far as Peru and Oman. Despite a Met Office weather warning for heavy rain, the event began with musical performances and is intended to foster international friendship and sailing training for young people. This marks Aberdeen's third time hosting the historic maritime event, which continues to be a significant tourist attraction for the city.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai's public support has fallen, with his disapproval rating recently surpassing his approval rating for the second time since he took office. According to the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation, this drop reflects a growing crisis of governance. Key issues contributing to the decline in public support include a divisive series of public talks and the president's stance on citizen-led recall campaigns. The foundation's chairman described the current situation as one of the most challenging moments of Lai's presidency so far, signaling significant political headwinds.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise on How to Evaluate High-Protein Snack Claims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for high-protein snacks is booming, but nutrition experts caution that marketing claims can be misleading. Many products labeled as "high-protein" also contain significant amounts of sugar and processed ingredients, undermining their health benefits. To assess a snack's true protein value, experts suggest a simple calculation: multiply the grams of protein by four and divide by the total calories to see the percentage of calories from protein, with 30% or more being a good benchmark. They also recommend prioritizing whole-food snacks like Greek yogurt, nuts, and cottage cheese over highly processed alternatives.</p>

          <p>The widespread environmental contamination by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," is a growing global health crisis. A recent court case in Italy sentenced chemical company executives for contaminating the drinking water of an estimated 350,000 people. These highly toxic and persistent chemicals, linked to cancer and other serious health issues, are found in everything from non-stick pans to waterproof clothing. Decades of evidence show companies like DuPont were aware of the dangers but concealed them, leading to massive contamination and subsequent legal battles in the US and Europe.</p>

          <p>Following a tragic flash flood at Camp Mystic in Texas that killed 27 campers, summer camps nationwide are scrutinizing their emergency preparedness plans. The incident has highlighted the need for better extreme weather monitoring and communication, especially in areas without reliable warning sirens. Camp directors are now implementing new measures, such as enhanced weather app usage and walkie-talkie systems, to prevent similar disasters. The American Camp Association anticipates more camps will seek accreditation to reassure parents about their safety protocols, marking a significant shift in industry standards.</p>

This shift is part of a broader strategy by Nestlé to refocus on core, high-growth categories like coffee.

Despite the administration's attempts to debunk certain claims, such as the existence of a blackmail "client list," the narrative has taken on a life of its own among some supporters.

          <p>The current U.S. administration's aggressive tariff strategy is causing economic uncertainty, with rising consumer prices fueling concerns about inflation. Despite official statements that inflation is under control, economists and the Federal Reserve are monitoring the delayed impact of these tariffs on the economy. This has led to public criticism from the president towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates, raising questions about the central bank's independence. The situation creates a complex economic landscape as businesses and consumers begin to feel the effects of the trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To combat impulsive and emotionally driven spending, financial therapists suggest asking a series of critical questions before making a purchase. Consumers should assess if the purchase fits their budget, if it's an attempt to fill an emotional need, or if it's driven by a desire to impress others. Experts recommend creating a dedicated budget for non-essential items and checking in with one's emotional state using the HALT acronym (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired). By being more intentional and doing proper research, individuals can make more mindful financial decisions and avoid purchases they might later regret.</p>

          <p>Following a lackluster performance in the Club World Cup, Los Angeles FC aims to win back fan support in a crucial derby match against its rival, the LA Galaxy. Despite their poor showing internationally, LAFC has regained momentum in the MLS with three consecutive wins and currently sits fourth in the Western Conference. In contrast, the Galaxy is at the bottom of the conference, but team officials emphasize that records are irrelevant in a high-stakes rivalry game. The match is set to be a tense affair as both teams look to secure a vital victory.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, Deborah Mason, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating a sophisticated drug trafficking operation worth up to £80 million. Known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' Mason recruited her four children and other family members to transport large quantities of cocaine across England. The family-run gang used encrypted apps and aliases to coordinate drug pickups from ports and deliveries nationwide. The operation funded a lavish lifestyle, including designer goods and luxury holidays, while Mason also claimed state benefits, leading to lengthy prison sentences for the entire group.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated heavyweight title rematch, boxing experts are divided on whether Daniel Dubois can avenge his 2023 loss to Oleksandr Usyk. While many, including Eddie Hearn, believe Usyk's superior skill and recent form will lead to another victory, others feel Dubois's newfound confidence and power could produce an upset. Some analysts suggest Usyk may be nearing the end of his career and could be vulnerable, while others maintain he is still the world's top heavyweight. The fight at Wembley Stadium will determine if Dubois can become Britain's first undisputed heavyweight champion since 1999.</p>

The new technique produces the specialized anticancer cells directly inside the patient's body using gene therapy tools, bypassing the complex and expensive conventional process. The team has successfully used this innovative in-vivo method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This breakthrough could make the promising but costly immunotherapy, which has also shown potential for treating asthma and autoimmune diseases, more accessible to patients worldwide.</p>

          <p>Parts of the UK are under an amber weather warning as severe thunderstorms are forecast to bring torrential rain and potential flash flooding over the weekend. The Met Office warns that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to fast-flowing, deep floodwaters, transport disruption, and power cuts. The heavy downpours follow a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing the risk of severe surface water flooding. The warning covers a large area including the south coast, London, and Cambridge.</p>

          <p>Italy is facing a deepening demographic crisis as its birth rate falls to a record low of 1.18 babies per woman, far below the replacement level. Small towns like Fregona are experiencing sharp population declines, leading to the closure of businesses and schools, which threatens community viability. Despite government initiatives like baby bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient to offset the challenges of high childcare costs and career pressures. Some private companies are creating their own solutions, like subsidized daycares, but broader systemic changes and increased immigration are seen as necessary solutions.</p>

Small and medium-sized enterprises find the potential tariffs "untenable" and fear it could stifle their ambition in the American market. While some larger corporations are exploring shifting production, many businesses with origin-protected products have no such option, creating a lose-lose situation for both EU producers and U.S. consumers.
