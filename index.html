          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to review rules governing 401(k) plans. This move could allow alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate to be included in retirement accounts, a long-sought goal for the alternative asset industry. While proponents see this as expanding investment opportunities, it also introduces new risks for retirement savers due to the higher fees and lack of transparency associated with these assets. The news prompted a rise in Bitcoin's value and private equity stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated that ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things through prayer and faith-consistent actions, citing this as a guiding principle in his own work on the Senate Banking Committee. Scott also contrasted his views on free markets and capitalism with the rise of socialist beliefs, which he argued "corrodes the soul." The article notes that his message comes amid declining religious affiliation and church attendance in the United States.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position as the UK's Homelessness Minister following accusations of hypocrisy regarding a rental property she owns. Critics, including opposition politicians and homelessness charities, called for her to step down after it was reported she increased the rent on her property by £700 a month shortly after ending the previous tenants' lease. In her resignation letter, Ali stated that remaining in her role would be a "distraction" from the government's work, while insisting she had complied with all legal requirements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing further construction on a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling follows a lawsuit by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening the sensitive ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees for now, the 14-day halt on construction prevents potential irreversible harm to the area. State officials have stated their intent to fight the judge's order.</p>

          <p>With rising credit card debt, many Americans face the risk of aggressive collection tactics, including having their bank accounts frozen. A debt collector can legally freeze an account, but only after filing a lawsuit and obtaining a court judgment against the debtor. Ignoring a court summons often leads to a default judgment, which then allows the collector to request a bank levy. However, certain funds are protected from garnishment, including Social Security, disability, and veterans' benefits, though the account holder may need to prove the source of these funds to have them released.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders are accusing Republicans of weaponizing federal law enforcement after Senator John Cornyn announced the FBI would assist in locating Texas Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers left the state to prevent a quorum and block a controversial GOP-led redistricting vote. Democrats argue the FBI has no legal authority in the matter and that the move is an attempt to silence dissent and help President Trump's agenda. The political standoff is intensified by a rivalry between Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who are both potential candidates for the U.S. Senate in 2026.</p>

          <h2>California Labor Federation Backs Ballot Measure to Redraw Congressional Districts</h2>

          <p>The influential California Federation of Labor has endorsed a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional maps, a move aimed at countering Republican redistricting efforts in states like Texas. The proposal, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, would allow the legislature to temporarily adjust district boundaries drawn by an independent commission four years ago. This could potentially shift up to six congressional seats in California to Democrats. The labor federation has committed to spending millions to support the measure, setting up a major political battle with reform groups dedicated to nonpartisan redistricting.</p>

          <p>Connected fitness company Peloton announced a surprise profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, causing its stock to rise. The positive result was driven by better-than-expected sales and significant cost-cutting measures. However, the company also revealed plans for another round of layoffs, impacting 6% of its staff, as it aims to reduce operating expenses by an additional $100 million. New CEO Peter Stern outlined a growth strategy that includes opening smaller "micro-stores," expanding into wellness categories beyond fitness, and improving the profitability of its hardware.

          <p>This opinion article asserts that Israel's policy of restricting humanitarian aid to Gaza is not only a moral atrocity but also a major strategic blunder. The author contends that the resulting hunger crisis has failed to weaken Hamas and has instead strengthened the group's leverage while severely damaging Israel's international standing. The policy has alienated key allies like the U.S. and prompted other Western nations to support recognizing a Palestinian state. The article concludes that these self-defeating actions are driven by Prime Minister Netanyahu's political dependence on far-right coalition partners.</p>

Analysts widely anticipate a "beat-and-raise" quarter, where the company exceeds earnings expectations and raises its future guidance. The stock has already gained nearly 34% year to date.

This is the most direct signal from a U.S. official about extending the deadline, which is set to expire next week. The statement was made as new, broad-based U.S. tariffs on imports from approximately 90 other countries took effect. Since April, the U.S. has significantly increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures and export controls from Beijing, creating ongoing global trade tensions.</p>

This potential expansion of military operations would require approval from Israel's Security Cabinet and likely face strong international opposition.

The city has been cut off from humanitarian aid by road for over a year due to the country's ongoing civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF has laid siege to the city, which is the last SAF-controlled urban center in the region, leading to a blockade on food and supplies.

          <p>President Trump announced he has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count. This move would have significant repercussions, as the constitutionally mandated decennial census determines the apportionment of congressional seats and the drawing of electoral districts for a decade. The U.S. Supreme Court previously blocked the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but experts note a longer legal runway exists for the 2030 count.</p>
