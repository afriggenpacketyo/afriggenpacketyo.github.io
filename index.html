          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced a 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit, surpassing estimates and setting a new record, largely due to robust demand for artificial intelligence chips. The company's revenue also grew significantly by 30.3% year-over-year, benefiting from the AI boom and producing advanced processors for clients like Nvidia and AMD. TSMC's CEO expressed strong conviction in the AI megatrend, leading to an increased 2025 revenue growth forecast and higher capacity expansion investments.

          <p>Ace Frehley, the iconic original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, has died at 74 after a recent fall. His family and former bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, expressed devastation, acknowledging his irreplaceable role in the band's formative years and legacy. Born in the Bronx in 1951, Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973, contributing to classic albums and known for his "Space Ace" persona and pyrotechnic stage presence. He later pursued a solo career, reunited with Kiss in the 90s, and his influence on subsequent rock bands was significant.</p>

          <p>A phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, agreeing to a future summit in Hungary, has complicated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington. The timing of the call, during which they discussed the Ukraine war and potential trade prospects, was seen as a "curveball" for Kyiv, which was hoping for increased military assistance, particularly long-range Tomahawk missiles. Ukraine is currently facing intense Russian attacks on infrastructure and a frontline stalemate, making U.S. support crucial. This article suggests Trump's willingness to supply more advanced weapons might now be further questioned.</p>

          <p>School districts in Eau Claire and Altoona, Wisconsin, are facing significant challenges due to declining student enrollment, a trend observed in 70% of the state's districts. This decline, influenced by lower birth rates and open enrollment policies, directly impacts school funding, which is based on per-pupil counts and has lagged behind inflation. While Altoona previously managed growth through residential development, both districts now experience revenue loss, exacerbating already tough financial situations. Officials are exploring efficiencies and alternative resource allocation to maintain educational quality amidst these pressures.</p>

          <p>China has introduced extensive new restrictions on rare earth exports, a strategic move that tightens its near-monopoly on these critical minerals essential for technology and defense. Foreign companies now require Chinese government approval and must declare intended use for products containing rare earths, escalating trade tensions with the U.S. President Trump responded with threats of additional tariffs and export controls. Experts suggest these curbs give China significant leverage in upcoming trade talks, as the U.S. and its allies are years away from developing alternative processing capacities.

This trend is fueled by increased openness from public figures, the rise of "sweat suits" and activewear brands, and new social practices like sauna business meetings. While historically associated with shame, modern beauty trends like "sweaty makeup" and the growing popularity of saunas suggest a liberation from old stigmas.

          <h2>Uganda's Special Forces Command: A 'Shadow Army' Bolstering Museveni's Decades-Long Rule</h2>

          <p>Uganda's Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit, is increasingly seen as a private army ensuring President Yoweri Museveni's decades-long grip on power and his family dynasty. Accused by critics of abducting, torturing, and killing opposition activists, the SFC denies these allegations. Its growing influence, with specialized training and sophisticated weaponry, reportedly rivals the regular army and causes resentment among senior generals. Concerns are raised about potential power struggles in a post-Museveni era, especially with his son, Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, leading the army and having strong ties to the SFC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>S&P Global Ratings forecasts that China's vast property market will continue its decline at least through 2026, with nationwide primary property sales expected to fall by 8% in 2025 and 6-7% in 2026 due to soft overall demand. This sustained downturn will exert ongoing pressure on Chinese developers, many of whom are already struggling to deliver homes while managing significant debt obligations. The article cites Cifi's plan to restructure debts as an example of developers' efforts to strengthen capital structures amidst the challenging market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump's CIA Authorization in Venezuela Raises Concerns Over Scope of Covert Operations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 19:24:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's unusual public acknowledgment of authorizing CIA covert operations in Venezuela raises significant concerns about the potential scope and implications of such actions. A presidential finding could grant the agency broad authority, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or efforts to destabilize the Maduro regime. Historically, such authorizations have led to diverse outcomes, from supporting insurgencies to regime change, often without direct congressional approval. Experts warn of a "slippery slope" given the CIA's complex history in Latin America and the lack of clear limitations on these operations.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of U.S. Southern Command, will retire at year's end, less than a year into his typical three-year posting, amid escalating military strikes in the Caribbean and tensions with Venezuela. Reports suggest friction between Holsey and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, with Holsey allegedly raising concerns about the drug boat mission and attacks. Senator Jack Reed, a top Democrat, called the unexpected departure "alarming," warning against military intervention in Venezuela without congressional authorization and criticizing the administration for potentially ignoring experienced warfighters' advice.</p>

          <p>Two men affiliated with the MS-13 street gang have been convicted for a brutal, coordinated attack in Lake Forest in October 2018 that resulted in one murder and an assault. The victims, a couple, were ambushed in their apartment complex's Jacuzzi, leading to Marco Morales being stabbed multiple times with a machete and chased through the building before succumbing to his injuries. Prosecutors revealed the motive stemmed from a dispute over a gun sale. The third accomplice, the sister of one of the attackers, pleaded guilty and testified, detailing the horrific nature of the crime.</p>

          <p>Indiana University has ordered its student-run newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), to stop printing news content and fired Jim Rodenbush, the director of student media and paper's adviser. Students and free expression groups condemn these actions as censorship and a "blatant attack" on editorial independence, especially after Rodenbush reportedly resisted the directive. The university claims the move is a shift from print to digital media to address financial deficits and prioritize digital-first careers, asserting that editorial control remains with IDS leadership. Critics, however, view it as a violation of First Amendment rights.</p>

          <h2>Pub Chain Greene King Identifies Cafes and Delivery Apps as New Market Rivals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 19:05:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nick Mackenzie, CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, acknowledges that cafes and delivery apps are emerging as new rivals, competing for consumers' leisure time and spending. This shift is driven by a growing segment of the population, particularly under-25s, who are choosing not to drink alcohol. Pubs are adapting by improving their coffee offerings, expanding food-led services, and incorporating "competitive socialising" activities like electronic dartboards. Mackenzie emphasizes pubs' enduring role as community fixtures while embracing trends towards well-being and diverse entertainment options.</p>
