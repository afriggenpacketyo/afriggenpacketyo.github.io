          <p>California's Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing significant changes to the state's healthcare program for undocumented immigrants due to budget constraints. The proposed changes include charging monthly premiums and halting new enrollments as early as January. These measures are part of a broader effort to address a budget shortfall, reflecting the challenges of balancing state resources with healthcare accessibility. The governor's plan highlights the ongoing debate surrounding healthcare for undocumented immigrants and the financial considerations involved.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress, defending the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to HHS, which include significant workforce reductions and consolidation of institutes. During the hearings, Kennedy avoided sharing his personal views on vaccines, stating that people should not take medical advice from him, a departure from his previous vaccine skepticism. Democratic senators grilled Kennedy on the impact of these cuts, particularly on programs like lead poisoning prevention and NIH clinical trials, with some warning that lives would be lost due to the reductions. Kennedy maintained that essential health programs would not be affected, despite reports indicating otherwise.</p>

          <h2>Republicans Plan Temporary Tax Cuts Set to Expire Before Trump Leaves Office</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 15:21:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are crafting a tax bill that includes temporary tax cuts, such as an increase to the child tax credit and a bonus to the standard deduction, set to expire at the end of 2028, just before President Trump's term ends. This strategy allows Republicans to avoid accounting for the long-term costs of the cuts, hoping they will become popular enough to be extended later. While some provisions, like lower individual income rates, would be permanent, the temporary nature of many cuts may reduce their impact on economic growth, and the bill includes new limits on qualifying for the child tax credit. The bill also includes spending cuts to programs like Medicaid, potentially offsetting any gains from the tax cuts for low-income Americans.</p>

Despite the resentencing, their future remains uncertain, with a parole board hearing scheduled to determine if they will be released.

          <p>Alex Jacobsen, owner of Auratone, a Nashville-based loudspeaker company, is considering moving his family business overseas due to the impact of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The tariffs, which include a 145% rate on goods from China, have made it difficult for Auratone to import necessary parts and remain competitive, as many parts are sourced from overseas. While some international buyers have increased their purchases in anticipation of price increases, Jacobsen is exploring moving manufacturing to Europe to benefit from free trade agreements. He says that tariffs may have the opposite effect of their intention.</p>

The judge emphasized the need to disrupt the chilling effect of his detention on others critical of Israel, noting that Suri's arrest appeared punitive.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices in the U.S., but the article explores the underlying reasons for high drug costs. Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs compared to other high-income countries, largely due to the lack of universal healthcare and limited negotiation power. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), intended to control drug prices, have been criticized for benefiting from inflated costs. While Trump's executive order may face legal challenges, Congress would need to act to truly change drug price negotiations, and pharmaceutical companies oppose lower prices, arguing it will affect innovation.

          <p>Former White House ethics counsels argue that Donald Trump is violating rules against foreign government presents, citing the potential acceptance of an airplane from Qatar and crypto entanglements with Abu Dhabi. They argue that accepting the plane would personally benefit Trump, while his crypto ventures provide opportunities for foreign governments to funnel emoluments to him. The writers argue that these actions violate the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution, and that Congress should restrict Trump's crypto investments. There are also concerns raised about the potential for surveillance issues with the plane.</p>

          <p>Harvard University's president, Alan M. Garber, has chosen to cut his pay by 25 percent in response to the university's clash with the Trump administration over academic independence and federal funding cuts. The symbolic gesture comes as Harvard faces the withdrawal of billions of dollars in research funding and challenges the administration's accusations of insufficient action against antisemitism. The university has already implemented hiring freezes and suspended merit raises, and is preparing for further turmoil as long as President Trump remains in office.</p>
