          <h2>Criminals Skipping Sentencing Could Face Additional Jail Time Under Proposed Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 04:24:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill being introduced in Parliament in England and Wales aims to add up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This legislative change comes in response to the distress experienced by victims' families when offenders avoid facing the consequences of their actions in court. The bill seeks to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice, ensuring they cannot evade hearing victim impact statements or being present for their sentencing. While some concerns are raised about the practicalities of compelling attendance, the bill is viewed as a symbolic step towards rebalancing power in favor of victims and their families, especially in cases of sexual assault or murder.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating trade tensions with the United States, China's central bank has implemented a series of measures to stimulate its economy. The People's Bank of China cut interest rates and lowered reserve requirements for banks, aiming to increase lending and inject liquidity into the market. These actions are intended to mitigate the impact of tariffs and trade uncertainties on Chinese businesses and consumers. While analysts anticipate a modest positive effect, concerns remain about lackluster demand from borrowers despite increased lending capacity. The timing of these measures is seen as a strategic buffer ahead of trade talks with the U.S., signaling China's concern about meeting its economic growth targets.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is pursuing a roadmap to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027; however, the plan faces significant obstacles. Despite overall reductions in Russian fossil fuel imports, there has been a rise in Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports into the EU. This inconsistency is partly due to the economic challenges of soaring energy prices and the cost of living crisis, prompting some countries to continue using Russian LNG. Experts suggest the EU must reduce its overall gas consumption through measures like better-insulated housing and promotion of solar panels, but internal divisions and potential US-brokered ceasefire talks could further complicate the EU's resolve.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet in Geneva, signaling a potential thaw in the ongoing trade war between the two countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will engage with Beijing's lead economic representative, He Lifeng, in what could pave the way for broader trade negotiations. Both sides have imposed hefty tariffs on each other's goods, impacting global trade and threatening a global recession. While China emphasizes its willingness to negotiate, it asserts it will not compromise its principles for any agreement. Some analysts predict a swift trade deal involving the removal of steep tariffs, though maintaining some duties on Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India launched missile strikes targeting what it claimed were terrorist camps inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, following an attack on Indian tourists. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an "act of war," raising fears of further conflict. The Kashmir region, claimed in full by both countries, is a densely militarized and volatile area, bordered by three nuclear powers: India, Pakistan, and China. China has urged both countries to exercise restraint, expressing concern that further conflict could destabilize the region.

          <p>Minneapolis is facing a surge in violence, with multiple shootings occurring within a 24-hour period, leading to fatalities and injuries. This has sparked criticism from figures like Jim Schultz, who attribute the rise in crime to anti-police rhetoric and reduced police budgets. The city became a focal point for the "defund the police" movement after George Floyd's death, leading to decreased police staffing and morale. Critics also point to policies embraced by the county prosecutor, Mary Moriarty, which they claim undermine public safety. The Justice Department has launched an investigation into the Hennepin County Attorneyâ€™s Office, focusing on whether race is illegally considered in prosecutorial decision-making.</p>

The conflict has roots in the partition of British India in 1947, with both countries claiming the territory. An armed revolt against Indian rule has persisted since 1989, and India accuses Pakistan of backing militants in the region, a charge Islamabad denies. India's recent missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir have escalated tensions, prompting fears of further conflict. Kashmir remains one of the most militarized zones in the world, underscoring the enduring nature of the dispute.</p>

          <p>India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, claiming to target terrorist infrastructure in response to a recent attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan condemned the strikes as unprovoked, asserting that they resulted in civilian casualties. The strikes have heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, prompting international concern. The strikes targeted multiple locations, including Muzaffarabad, Kotli, and Bahawalpur, with Pakistan's defense minister claiming the strikes hit civilian areas. The situation remains volatile, with potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement aimed at reducing costs and streamlining trade between the two nations. The UK will lower taxes on goods imported from India, including clothing, food products, and jewelry, while India will cut taxes on goods imported from the UK, such as cosmetics, scotch whisky, and medical devices. The deal will also enable British firms to compete for more service contracts in India. While the agreement is not expected to have immediate effects, the UK government anticipates it will boost trade by an additional Â£25.5 billion a year by 2040 and enhance the UK economy by Â£4.8 billion.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has cautioned that U.S. restrictions on sales to China will result in a US$1.5 billion revenue hit this year. This guidance stems from an export restriction imposed in April targeting AMDâ€™s MI308 chips. The company expects a US$700 million reduction in data center revenue in the current period due to decreased sales of that product. CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic about overall demand for AI infrastructure and anticipates new chips will boost sales in the second half of the year, though the company faces investor concerns about trade restrictions and competition with Nvidia.</p>
