          <p>A US federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's effort to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for an estimated 1.1 million Venezuelan and Haitian migrants. The ruling allows approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians to maintain their legal right to live and work in the United States, with the judge asserting that conditions in their home countries remain too dangerous for return. This decision, which the Department of Homeland Security plans to appeal, overturns the administration's move to reverse TPS extensions and end the program for Venezuela, which the DHS claims has been "abused, exploited, and politicised as a de facto amnesty program." The judicial action underscores ongoing legal battles over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Joe Kennedy III has publicly condemned his cousin, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., labeling him a "threat to the health and wellbeing of every American" and demanding his resignation. This strong rebuke comes in the wake of RFK Jr.'s contentious Senate hearing, where he was accused of dismissing CDC scientists and appointing individuals with controversial views. The incident further exacerbates a deep-seated family feud within the Kennedy dynasty, which is increasingly divided over RFK Jr.'s association with President Donald Trump and his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda. Several family members have previously voiced concerns about his suitability for the role, intensifying the political and personal conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol, experienced a notable decline after reports emerged that US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might suggest a link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism in an upcoming federal report. Kenvue, however, vehemently defends the safety of its product, asserting that extensive scientific evaluation shows no causal connection between acetaminophen use and autism, a stance echoed by major medical organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The Department of Health and Human Services has dismissed the report's contents as speculative, but the situation underscores the ongoing public health debate and market sensitivity to statements from high-ranking officials. Previous lawsuits against Kenvue alleging such links were dismissed due to lack of scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>NeueHouse, an exclusive members-only co-working club with locations in Venice, Hollywood, and New York City, suddenly ceased operations, citing severe financial challenges. The announcement, made just two days after promoting new memberships, left members with less than 48 hours to retrieve their belongings and employees abruptly jobless. The company attributed the closure to "legacy liabilities" despite the business being valued by its members. This shutdown, which follows the death of co-founder Joshua Abram, highlights the struggles faced by some co-working spaces in recent years, despite NeueHouse's unique blend of shared office convenience and luxury club amenities. Many members who paid annual fees upfront are now expressing anger and frustration over the sudden cessation of services.</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive day, Venezuelan military aircraft, identified as F-16 fighter jets, conducted provocative flyovers near the USS Jason Dunham, a U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer, in international waters. Pentagon officials characterized these actions as a dangerous "game of chicken" aimed at disrupting U.S. counter-narco-terrorism operations in the South American region. President Trump issued a stern warning, indicating that U.S. Navy captains would have the authority to respond if the Venezuelan jets continued to fly in dangerous positions. These escalating aerial encounters follow a recent U.S. military strike against an alleged Venezuelan drug-trafficking vessel, further heightening already strained relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has recently experienced a rally, which analysts largely attribute to robust guidance from its central bank rather than purely market-driven forces, despite a mostly steady US dollar index. This period of strengthening is expected to remain measured, as Beijing aims to avoid negatively impacting the competitiveness of its exporters amidst persistent trade tensions with the United States. Although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a potential September interest rate cut, which could influence the dollar's value, China's central bank appears to be strategically intervening to manage its currency. This highlights a deliberate effort by Chinese authorities to steer economic stability and global trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chicago Sky has suspended two-time All-Star Angel Reese for the first half of Sunday's game against Las Vegas, citing comments she made that were considered "detrimental to the team." This disciplinary action follows Reese's earlier public frustrations with the franchise, where she suggested she might seek to "move in a different direction" if the team's outlook didn't improve, although she later apologized and retracted those statements. Reese had already served a separate one-game suspension for accumulating her eighth technical foul of the season. The Sky released a statement affirming their commitment to player safety, respect, and well-being, emphasizing internal resolution and moving forward as a unified team.</p>

The weak report virtually guarantees a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, with some experts suggesting a larger 0.5 percentage point reduction to stimulate growth.

This situation has reignited a stalled national debate on whether to reverse a 19th-century ruling that abolished female succession, despite widespread public support for Princess Aiko, Emperor Naruhito's daughter. The Imperial Family faces a structural flaw in its succession system, prompting calls for urgent legal revisions to ensure the monarchy's continuity.</p>

          <p>U.S. lottery spending is on the rise, with Americans collectively spending an average of $320 on tickets in 2023, a 4% increase from the previous year. A LendingTree analysis reveals Massachusetts residents lead the nation, shelling out an average of $915 annually on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at $50 per year, possibly due to limited access in rural areas. Lottery sales contribute significantly to state revenues, accounting for about 1% of general revenue nationally, and up to 3% in some states. The Powerball jackpot recently swelled to an estimated $1.8 billion, fueling continued public interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is advancing its regulatory framework for crypto and digital assets, with a new draft of a major market structure bill introducing a provision to prevent tokenized stocks and other securities from being treated as commodities. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hopes for the bill to reach the president's desk by year-end, following the passage of a stablecoin bill signed by President Donald Trump in July. The "Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025" aims to clarify whether digital assets are regulated as securities or commodities, a key concern for crypto companies. Bipartisan discussions are underway, though Democratic support is still being sought for the measure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, a certified public accountant offers crucial advice to potential winners: choose between a lump sum or 30 graduated annual payments. While the lump sum, estimated at $826.4 million before taxes, offers immediate control, it's deemed "dangerous" for many due to the risk of overspending, leading numerous past winners to bankruptcy. The annuity option is considered a "safe bet" for its structured payouts over 29 years. The accountant strongly advises keeping the win secret, signing the ticket, and immediately seeking counsel from an attorney, CPA, and financial advisor to manage the substantial financial windfall responsibly.

          <p>World number two Carlos Alcaraz, 22, secured his spot in the US Open final by defeating 38-year-old Novak Djokovic in a compelling semi-final match, 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 6-2. Alcaraz's youth and energy proved decisive against the 24-time major champion, whose physical stamina faded in the third set. While the first two sets were tightly contested, Alcaraz's strong serve and aggressive groundstrokes ultimately overpowered Djokovic, who acknowledged his opponent's high level and his own "ran out of gas." The 2022 champion will now face either Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime in Sunday's final, marking another significant achievement in his burgeoning career.</p>

This crackdown coincides with the aggressive rollout of Max, a new state-controlled "super-app" designed to integrate multiple functions, including government services and banking, mirroring China's WeChat. Officials cite data storage laws and scam prevention, but critics view it as a move to increase surveillance and censorship, especially given Max's privacy policy allows data sharing with government bodies. Additionally, entire Russian cities are experiencing growing mobile internet blackouts, justified by authorities as drone attack protection, further limiting citizens' access to independent information and services.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, a prominent AI company, has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement with authors in a copyright infringement lawsuit, signaling a new era for AI and artistic compensation. The agreement, awaiting judicial approval, would provide authors with approximately $3,000 per work for an estimated 500,000 books, establishing a significant precedent for the industry. While a judge previously ruled Anthropic's use of books for AI training constituted "fair use," the settlement addresses the company's illegal downloading of millions of copyrighted books from online pirate libraries. This outcome suggests that AI companies may need to compensate creators for training data, fostering a more sustainable ecosystem for content creators.</p>

However, officials at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum argue that a unilateral federal takeover is not legally possible and "makes no sense" given the administration's broader efforts to reduce federal bureaucracy. New York Governor Kathy Hochul expressed strong concerns, citing fears of federal influence over historical narratives and urging support for victims' families and survivors.</p>
