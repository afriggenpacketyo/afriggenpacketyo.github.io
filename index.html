          <p>China's Cyberspace Administration, collaborating with financial regulators, has shut down numerous social media accounts for spreading false financial information and illegally touting stocks. The crackdown addresses growing concerns about financial influencers who use sensationalist headlines and questionable claims to attract investors. Authorities aim to protect investors from misleading information and market disruption, urging the public to invest wisely and avoid rumors. China had over 220 million individual investors at the end of last year, making it a large market susceptible to such scams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Kingerski, a 26-year-old police officer, died by suicide five months after undergoing LASIK eye surgery, which his parents attribute to debilitating side effects such as severe headaches and double vision. Despite vision experts claiming the procedure is generally safe, Kingerski's parents are advocating for greater transparency and accountability within the laser eye surgery industry. They have filed a complaint with the FDA, seeking investigation into long-term effects and more explicit warnings on consent forms. Previous suicides have been reported following laser eye surgeries, highlighting the need for comprehensive information and mental health support.</p>

Experts testified that Khalil's activism and criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza have made him a target. A federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation while considering whether his constitutional right to free speech was violated.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is considering amending the Building Energy Act, aiming to relax regulations on heating systems and prioritize energy security alongside climate protection. Reiche plans to construct new gas-fired power plants and potentially abolish the operating ban on older gas boilers. While the previous government focused on promoting heat pumps, the new administration seeks a more balanced approach. Critics argue that Reiche's plans could lead to new fossil fuel dependencies, while supporters emphasize the need for energy security and diverse solutions.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom after failing to meet its delivery targets, with almost a quarter of first-class post arriving late in the past year. The company could face a fine for not meeting the required 93% target for first-class mail delivered within one working day. Royal Mail Chief Operating Officer Alistair Cochrane acknowledged the quality of service is not where it needs to be, and reiterated the need for reform of the universal service obligation. Citizens Advice has criticized Royal Mail for raising stamp prices while failing to deliver post on time.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's legal battle over his security arrangements in the UK has reached a dead end after his appeal was denied. The courts ruled that Prince Harry did not understand how the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) operates, which authorizes security for senior royals. The committee determined that his decision to step back from royal duties and live outside the UK made his security needs exceptional. Prince Harry argued that his birthright made him a target, but the court sided with Ravec's decision to assess his security needs on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>Many women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are hesitant to get pregnant due to the potential return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts if they stop taking contraceptive pills. PMDD affects up to 8% of women and causes intense emotional and physical symptoms leading up to menstruation. Treatment options are limited, and women who want children face a dilemma as they may have to come off medication. The Welsh government said it was determined to improve the diagnosis, treatment and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

The increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments should benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, especially amid strengthening ties between China and oil-rich Qatar. This trend aligns with China's effort to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling.</p>
