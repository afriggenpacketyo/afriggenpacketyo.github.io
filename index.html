Zelensky emphasized the justice of returning war to its origin, though the scale of the Belgorod operation is smaller compared to actions in Kursk. These incursions aim to force Moscow to redeploy troops from the Donetsk region and potentially serve as bargaining chips in future peace negotiations.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, a major beneficiary of global trade, faces potential economic disruption from President Trump's new tariffs, which could significantly impact the nation's export-driven GDP. The tariffs, including a steep 46% import duty, could reduce Vietnam's economic growth and diminish its appeal as a manufacturing hub for companies like Nike, Adidas, and Apple. This shift may also affect foreign direct investment and prompt some companies to relocate production. While discrepancies exist between U.S. and Vietnamese trade statistics, the tariffs pose a considerable risk to Vietnam's economy.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs against China, raising concerns about a potential recession. Leading indexes initially fell sharply before briefly rebounding on a false report of a tariff freeze. Economists have warned that the tariffs could negatively impact economic growth and drive up inflation. The market's uncertainty is heavily influenced by Trump's comments and their impact on automated trading algorithms. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport alleged gang members, but with certain limitations. The justices emphasized the necessity for proper legal process, requiring individuals to be given time to challenge their detention and for the government to prove its legal justification. While the administration claims the ruling as a victory, the court's majority placed limits on how deportations may occur. The ACLU also claimed the ruling as a "huge victory".</p>

            <p>Global stock markets experienced wild swings following President Trump's tariff rollout, with the president doubling down on his plan and threatening further tariffs on China. The EU has said it offered the US a “zero-for-zero” tariff deal on cars and industrial goods weeks before Donald Trump launched his trade war. The Supreme court allows deportations under 18th century law. Donald Trump has announced that the US is to hold direct talks with Iran in a bid to prevent the country from obtaining an atomic bomb. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, met with Donald Trump Monday for the second time since the US president’s return to office.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has cleared the way for President Donald Trump to use a wartime powers law to rapidly deport alleged gang members. While the administration is claiming the ruling as a win, the justices mandated that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. Trump has alleged that the migrants were members of the Tren de Aragua gang and could therefore be removed under the Act. The court's decision vacates an earlier ruling that had temporarily blocked the use of the law to carry out the deportations.</p>
