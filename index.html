          <p>Space transportation company Firefly Aerospace has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker "FLY." The filing occurs amid a renewed interest in IPOs, following a market downturn in 2022. Firefly, known for its Alpha rockets and a successful lunar landing with its Blue Ghost lander, reported a significant revenue increase to $55.9 million in the first quarter, though it also recorded a net loss of $60.1 million. The company's backlog is valued at approximately $1.1 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will send Patriot air defense systems and other weapons to Ukraine, with distribution and payment handled by NATO. The decision follows a direct appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for 10 Patriot systems to counter a surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. The move marks a reversal from a recent pause on some critical weapons shipments to Kyiv. The advanced Patriot systems are crucial for Ukraine's layered defense against Russian aerial bombardments, protecting cities and critical infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash that killed 270 people found that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were activated moments after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other pilot denying he did so. While one engine began to regain thrust, the second did not, leading to the crash 32 seconds into the flight. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau did not assign blame or find fault with the Boeing 787-8 aircraft or its engines.</p>

          <p>A significant disagreement has arisen between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino regarding the public handling of a review into the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The conflict reportedly occurred during a White House meeting, leading to Bongino's absence from work and speculation he may resign. The review concluded Epstein died by suicide and found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail of prominent figures, a finding that frustrated some of President Trump's supporters. The internal friction highlights tensions within the administration over the politically sensitive case.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from The Atlantic satirically comments on the state of NASA, which is facing significant workforce reductions and budget cuts under the Trump administration. The article mockingly discusses the appointment of former reality-TV star Sean Duffy as the interim head of the agency, suggesting it aligns with a broader theme of undoing past national achievements. The author humorously argues that space travel is now best left to billionaires and that NASA's new role is simply to manage its own decline comfortably. The piece uses sharp wit to critique the current administration's priorities regarding science and exploration.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, a remarkable achievement following an indefinite break from the sport in 2023. Once a teenage prodigy, Anisimova stepped away to address burnout and mental health struggles, a decision some warned could end her career at the top level. Her journey back has been a "roller coaster," but her run at Wimbledon, including a semifinal win over the world's top-ranked player, proves a return to form is possible. Her story highlights a growing conversation about mental well-being in professional sports.</p>

          <p>Activists and lawyers accuse the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and LAPD of improperly using less-lethal weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas during recent protests against federal immigration raids. Numerous protesters and journalists have reported severe injuries, including one man whose finger was amputated by a flash-bang grenade. Civil rights claims argue that law enforcement has responded to peaceful protests with "militarized violence," violating department policies and a state law that restricts the use of such weapons. The incidents have sparked dozens of official complaints and legal challenges against the city and county.</p>

The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts for large parts of England, warning of risks to the entire population.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The involuntary staff reductions are part of a plan to shrink the department's U.S. workforce by about 15% and consolidate numerous domestic offices. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the "indiscriminate cuts" undermine national security. The move follows the recent absorption of USAID into the State Department, a controversial decision that has also drawn significant pushback.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned the mortgage fraud conviction of former Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, citing an "erroneously overbroad" jury instruction regarding the case's venue. However, the court upheld two separate perjury convictions against her. These convictions relate to her lying about her finances to make early withdrawals from her retirement account during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mosby, who gained a national profile for prosecuting officers in the Freddie Gray case, was sentenced to home confinement and community service but was spared jail time.</p>

Analysts noted that Sinner's dominant performance, mirroring Djokovic's own style, marked a potential turning point.
