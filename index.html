          <p>Multiple immigration enforcement operations conducted across Los Angeles by Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI led to dozens of arrests and citywide protests. The raids occurred in areas like Westlake District and downtown L.A., with ICE stating approximately 44 people were arrested. Community organizations estimated even higher numbers, while video footage showed agents detaining individuals. The LAPD and Sheriff's Department clarified their non-involvement in civil immigration enforcement, while protesters marched and clashed with police, resulting in an "unlawful assembly" declaration and dispersal order, as city officials expressed anger and concern over the tactics used. Optimism remains low given the disruption to communities and families. </p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement, paving the way for US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a major shift in college sports history. The settlement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion to former players barred from revenue sharing. This ruling will significantly impact college athletics, professionalizing the recruitment of stars and potentially affecting smaller programs. The agreement brings uniformity to the rules, although states still have separate laws regarding NIL deals. </p>

The settlement also establishes a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements for "fair market value." Some schools may opt out, continuing to compensate athletes only with scholarships. </p>
