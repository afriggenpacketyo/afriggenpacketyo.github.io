        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, is now available via prescription from general practitioners in England, but only for individuals meeting specific criteria, such as a BMI of 40 or over and the presence of multiple related health conditions. NHS England plans a staggered rollout to manage GP workload and resources, with some practices warning ineligible patients against booking appointments for the drug. Pharmacy organizations express concerns about supply meeting demand, while healthcare staff require training for safe and appropriate administration, including monthly check-ups for patients. Mounjaro has been available in specialist NHS weight loss clinics since March, and other weight loss services remain available to those who do not meet the criteria. The article provides context on the criteria and timeframe for wider availability. The optimism score is based on the potential positive impact of the drug, balanced against the limitations and challenges of its rollout.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, citing the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity as the objective. The strikes involved B-2 Spirit bombers and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles, targeting sites including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Defense Department officials reported severe damage to all three sites, while the U.S. communicated to Iran that the strikes were not aimed at regime change. Iran condemned the strikes, vowing retaliation and consulting with Russia, while the U.N.'s IAEA confirmed no increase in off-site radiation levels, urging restraint. The context is based on the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, and the potential for wider conflict in the Middle East. The optimism score is based on the potential for de-escalation and peace, balanced against the risks of further conflict and instability.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, describing the operation as a "spectacular military success" and warning of further attacks if Iran does not pursue peace. The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the objective of ending Iran's nuclear threat. Trump thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military, stating that the targeted sites were the most difficult and lethal. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization acknowledged the strikes, but claimed they would not halt Iran's nuclear program. The context is based on heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with Iran threatening retaliation for U.S. intervention in the conflict with Israel. The optimism score is based on the potential for diplomatic resolution, balanced against the risks of escalation and further military action.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil trade route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil daily. Iran controls the northern side of the strait, making it a crucial chokepoint in global energy security. Secretary of State Rubio warned that blocking the strait would be a "suicidal move" for Iran, potentially drawing backlash from countries dependent on the route. The U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait. The optimism score reflects the potential for maintaining stability in oil markets, balanced against the risk of disruptions and economic consequences.</p>

At Isfahan, extensive building damage is visible, while Natanz shows a large crater over part of the underground complex. The U.N.'s IAEA reported no increase in off-site radiation levels, but acknowledged its inability to assess underground damage at Fordo. Defense Secretary Hegseth stated the U.S. used decoy B-2 bombers and other deception tactics to protect the bombers during the mission.

The bombers dropped "bunker-buster" bombs on Fordo and Natanz, while Tomahawk missiles targeted Isfahan. The U.S. deployed deception tactics and fighter jets to protect the bombers, and no shots were fired at the planes.

This combination of long-term planning and government funding also allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production.

          <p>Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, criticized his former network as "propaganda" for its pro-war message. He named Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Ike Perlmutter, and Miriam Adelson as "warmongers" urging President Trump to intervene in Israel's war with Iran. Carlson's comments have been met with irony online, given his history of promoting conspiracy theories and disinformation on Fox News. The context is the ongoing debate about media bias and its influence on public opinion. The optimism score reflects the potential for greater media accountability, balanced against the challenges of misinformation.</p>
