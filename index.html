          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC's Investing Club described recent ADP jobs data as "disturbing," highlighting a significant decline in hiring growth at U.S. companies. He noted the data has fueled speculation about potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Cramer also commented on CrowdStrike's post-earnings stock drop despite strong results, viewing it as an overreaction, and cautioned about Broadcom's high stock value leading up to earnings, focusing on the company's custom AI chip business. The ADP data has reignited President Donald Trump's call for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Canada have led to the evacuation of over 33,000 people across Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, prompting states of emergency in the first two provinces. The fires, exacerbated by warmer weather and drier conditions, have resulted in two deaths in Manitoba. Smoke from these fires has drifted into northern U.S. states, impacting air quality, and even reached parts of western Europe. Firefighters and resources from other Canadian provinces and the U.S. are assisting in battling the blazes, which are largely attributed to human activity, with strong winds and lack of precipitation hindering containment efforts, and the Canadian armed forces assisting with the evacuation of two separate Indigenous communities in the province.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which experts predict will increase costs for various consumer products. Industries such as automobile manufacturing, sports equipment, and canned goods are likely to be affected due to their reliance on these metals. While some businesses may absorb the costs, many are expected to pass them on to consumers through higher prices, potentially impacting household budgets. The tariffs are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, though economists warn of potential job losses and consumer price increases (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Vietnam has abolished its long-standing two-child policy in response to a declining birth rate and a shrinking working-age population. Lawmakers passed amendments to the Population Law, allowing families to decide how many children they wish to have. The previous policy, in place since 2009, restricted families to one or two children, with stricter enforcement for government officials and Communist Party members. The Ministry of Health estimates the country's population at over 100 million, but the national fertility rate has dropped to 1.91 per woman, below the replacement level, and the two-child policy has been abandoned to increase it.</p>
