          <h2>Major Earthquake Near Russia Triggers Widespread Tsunami Warnings Across Pacific</h2>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has prompted tsunami warnings and advisories across the Pacific basin. The U.S. National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning for Hawaii and parts of Alaska, while an advisory covers the entire U.S. West Coast. The first waves, some measuring around one foot, have already reached Japan's coast, and officials in Hawaii are urging residents to seek higher ground as a precaution. This article explains the different levels of tsunami alerts and notes this is the strongest earthquake globally since the 2011 Japan quake.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a three-day hearing regarding the January midair collision between a regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people. The investigation is examining the notoriously congested airspace around Reagan National Airport, as well as potential equipment malfunctions on the helicopter, such as its altimeters. The hearing aims to gather facts to determine the probable cause and issue safety recommendations, not to assign blame for the deadliest U.S. aviation accident since 2001.</p>

          <h2>Australia Reverses Course to Include YouTube in Social Media Ban for Minors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 23:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Australian government has reversed an earlier decision and will now include YouTube in its landmark social media ban for children under 16. The video platform had initially been granted an exemption but was added after the country's eSafety Commissioner highlighted it as the top platform where minors encounter harmful content. While YouTube argues it is a video-sharing platform and not social media, the government is moving forward with the law, which is set to take effect in December 2025 and will impose heavy fines on non-compliant tech companies.</p>

This agreement's value surpasses the company's entire second-quarter revenue, highlighting its significance for LG's expanding operations, including new manufacturing hubs in the United States.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to revoke its 2009 'endangerment finding,' the scientific basis that classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat under the Clean Air Act. This foundational ruling has enabled the regulation of emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other sources for over a decade.
