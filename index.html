          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were slated to be laid off following a reduction in force announced on March 11. The preliminary injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by 21 states after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department. The judge emphasized the necessity of the department's ability to fulfill its obligations and adhere to congressional mandates. This ruling provides a temporary reprieve for the affected employees and underscores the legal challenges faced by the administration's efforts to reshape the agency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump's tax bill with a 215-214 vote, marking a significant victory for Republicans after weeks of crafting and amending the legislation. The bill faced unanimous opposition from Democrats, who criticized its steep cuts to social safety nets to finance tax cuts favoring the wealthy, and some Republicans. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future despite Republican leaders' aim to get it to Trump's desk by July 4. Analysts express concern over the bill's potential to increase federal deficits and weaken long-term fiscal health, while Democrats say the bill favors the wealthy at the expense of lower-income households.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has ordered its last batch of "blanks" for pennies, signaling an end to penny production due to rising manufacturing costs. The move is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually, as the cost to mint a penny now exceeds its face value. The U.S. Mint anticipates savings of $56 million in material costs alone. The phase-out will lead businesses to round prices to the nearest nickel, with the last of the new pennies entering circulation early next year. With over 114 billion pennies already in circulation, a gradual shift is planned to avoid triggering a rush to redeem the coins.</p>

Cudi described a break-in at his home and a threatening phone call from Combs after Ventura informed him that Combs had discovered their relationship. Ventura testified that Combs had threatened to blow up Cudi's car. Cudi stated that he met Combs shortly after the fire, who gave him a 'cold stare' and denied any involvement in the arson attack. The prosecution alleges that Combs ran a criminal enterprise for two decades, including having his associates commit violent acts against rivals.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation to transfer control of the U.S. Marshals Service from the executive branch to the federal judiciary, aiming to shield the agency from political interference. This move is prompted by concerns that the Marshals, responsible for protecting judges, could be compromised by the White House or Justice Department due to criticisms of judges ruling against the Trump administration. The bill seeks to establish a special board, including the Chief Justice of the United States, to oversee the Marshals, mirroring the structure of the U.S. Capitol Police. The proposal follows increasing threats against judges, including a fatal shooting targeting the son of a U.S. District Judge, underscoring the urgency of ensuring judicial security.</p>

The incident occurred in Chongjin when the ship lost balance during launch, tearing holes in its hull. Kim Jong-un condemned the failure as a criminal act caused by carelessness and ordered the responsible officials to be censured. He emphasized the need for the destroyer to be restored by the next Workersâ€™ Party meeting in June, framing the matter as a political issue tied to the state's prestige. Despite this setback, North Korea launched multiple cruise missiles on the same day, and analysts believe the ship was built with Russian technology.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlock, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling against creating the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the decision. The ruling leaves in place lower court decisions that found the arrangement violated the First Amendment's establishment clause. While a setback for the religious freedom movement, the decision is not a binding precedent nationwide, leaving the door open for future reconsideration in other states.

          <p>The House passed President Trump's domestic policy bill by a narrow margin of 215 to 214, following an all-night session and intense negotiations.

Speaker Mike Johnson touted the bill as a means to get Americans back to winning, while Democrats criticized it as a reckless tax scam.

          <p>The House passed a tax bill that includes a $40,000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), phasing out over $500,000. The provision, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, would go into effect in 2025. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. However, the proposal could face pushback in the Senate. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>

The feature has been used to create explicit images of public figures, including J. D. Vance, and minors, raising concerns about its potential for abuse.
