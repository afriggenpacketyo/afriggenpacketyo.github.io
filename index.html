          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 14:17:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who volunteer to return to their countries of origin. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that this 'self-deportation' program is the safest and most cost-effective way for immigrants to leave the United States, avoiding arrest and saving taxpayer money. Immigrants must use the CBP's 'Home' app to confirm their arrival in their home country to receive the stipend. Participants will also be deprioritized for detention and removal while they prepare to depart, potentially keeping the door open for legal immigration in the future.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced that its nonprofit arm will maintain control of the company despite restructuring into a public benefit corporation, a decision made after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. This move addresses pressure from civic leaders and former employees concerned about the company's direction as it navigates the competitive AI landscape. CEO Sam Altman expressed satisfaction with the arrangement, emphasizing that the nonprofit and the PBC will share the same mission. The announcement comes amid an ongoing legal dispute with Elon Musk, who opposes OpenAI's transition to a for-profit model. </p>

          <p>Three women who were part of 'Operation Babylift,' the U.S. government's airlift of Vietnamese children to America for adoption in April 1975, shared their experiences 50 years later. The series of flights, aimed at rescuing children during the fall of Saigon, was not without controversy, as some children were later found to have living families. While some adoptees have sought to uncover their past through DNA tests, others have no desire to find biological relatives, all three women expressed love for their adoptive parents and gratitude for the opportunities they have had in America. One of the women recounts how she was sexually abused as a young child by individuals close to the family and now uses her music to help foster and adopted children who have similar trauma.</p>

          <p>Soybean and corn farmers in western Iowa are facing increased economic pressure due to high costs, low crop prices, and a significant trade war with China. The article profiles Beau Hanson, a farmer in Monona County, Iowa, who is grappling with these challenges as he prepares for the planting season. The tariffs imposed by President Trump on Chinese imports have led to retaliatory taxes on U.S. goods, including Midwestern crops, impacting farmers who rely heavily on exports to China. Farmers are tightening their belts, lenders are becoming more cautious, and there's a sense of uncertainty reminiscent of the 1980s farm crisis, despite hopes for government assistance.</p>

The performance marks the end of Roth's first retirement, with more shows scheduled.

Roth's most recent show before this was a private 2023 corporate gig for Home Depot, according to Rolling Stone; before that, he opened for Kiss on a tour that ended in March 2020 amid widespread cancellations and postponements related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>New York City is ending its decades-long Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which aimed to protect the city's drinking water supply by purchasing land in the watershed. Since 1997, the city has acquired over 156,000 acres to prevent pollution, but an independent review found that further land purchases would have little benefit. The city will now focus on a Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring local approval for land transactions. The shift comes after years of pressure from the Coalition of Watershed Towns, which sought more control over local land use.</p>

The appointment of a new U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who is attempting to undo a jury's decision in an excessive force case is cited as an example of this shift.</p>
