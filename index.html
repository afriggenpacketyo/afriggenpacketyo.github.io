            <p>An Israeli military inquiry attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders." The IDF claims troops believed they were facing a threat, citing poor night visibility as a contributing factor, and said six of the casualties were Hamas members, but provided no evidence. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report. The incident, which involved a convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulances, a UN car, and a fire truck, has drawn international condemnation.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" start to economic activity followed by a summer drop-off. Businesses and consumers are preemptively purchasing goods in anticipation of higher tariffs, potentially inflating economic activity in the short term. Goolsbee noted that sectors like the auto industry are likely to stockpile inventory before tariffs on imported goods increase further. Despite short-term uncertainty, Goolsbee remains optimistic about the country's longer-term economic outlook.</p>

Zelensky dismissed Putin's declaration of a truce as a "PR" exercise, while the Russian defence ministry insisted its troops had "strictly observed the ceasefire".
