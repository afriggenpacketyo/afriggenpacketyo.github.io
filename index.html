          <p>Senator Miguel Uribe Turbay, a Colombian presidential contender, was critically wounded after being shot at a campaign event in Bogota. The attack occurred while Uribe was speaking with people in a park, and authorities have detained a suspect believed to be a teenager. Uribe's wife has requested prayers for his recovery, and Colombian President Gustavo Petro has canceled a trip abroad in response to the shooting, emphasizing the importance of respecting life. The incident has drawn condemnation from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called it a threat to democracy. Optimism remains subdued given the seriousness of the attack and its potential implications for Colombia's political stability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles following large-scale protests sparked by ICE operations. President Trump cited the inability of California's governor and Los Angeles' mayor to manage the situation, invoking Title 10 authority to deploy 2,000 troops. Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that the federal government is sowing chaos, while local law enforcement reported the demonstrations were peaceful. The deployment follows ICE raids in various Los Angeles districts, resulting in numerous arrests and sparking widespread demonstrations, raising questions about federal overreach and states' rights.</p>

Yamamoto faced Lars Nootbaar, his former Samurai Japan teammate, striking him out twice, but ultimately, the Dodgers' inability to capitalize on opportunities led to their defeat.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, discusses how flexible working arrangements have allowed her to balance her career and motherhood, which she believes is crucial for teacher retention. Annual data reveals a decline in the overall number of teachers and fewer entering the profession, despite government efforts to recruit new educators. Computer science teacher Sam Alner highlights the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance, leading experienced staff to seek alternative employment. Flexible working options, particularly for new parents, are seen as essential for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession.</p>

          <p>The UK's plans to modernize and potentially expand its nuclear arsenal, as outlined in the 2025 strategic defence review, are raising concerns about escalating the global nuclear arms race. Critics argue that this move undermines international non-proliferation efforts and increases the risk of deploying tactical nuclear weapons in conflict zones. The decision to spend billions on new nuclear warheads and submarines is seen as a continuation of a flawed deterrence policy that Britain can ill afford. The article contends that this decision sends a negative signal to other countries and moves the world closer to nuclear warfare.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to California amid immigration protests has widened the divide between state and federal leaders.

Defense Secretary Hegseth threatened to mobilize active-duty Marines, further escalating tensions, while the Los Angeles Police Department reported peaceful demonstrations, the situation underscores the growing political tensions between California and the federal government.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrates the potential for treating human blindness with biocompatible nanowire implants. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, acting as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. The advance offers hope for restoring vision and expanding visual capabilities in humans.</p>

The TSA emphasized this message in a Facebook post, humorously reminding travelers that their Costco membership cards do not meet the REAL ID requirements. The confusion may stem from the presence of gold stars on Costco cards, similar to the markings on REAL ID-compliant documents.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in China. A study by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women, clashing with economic changes.</p>
