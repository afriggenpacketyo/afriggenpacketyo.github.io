          <p>Overnight Russian strikes across Ukraine resulted in at least seven fatalities and 41 injuries, targeting both civilian and energy infrastructure. The city of Kharkiv experienced particularly heavy attacks, with 48 drones, five guided aerial bombs, four MLRS, and three missiles hitting homes and civilian facilities. Other regions, including Kherson and Donetsk, also reported casualties and damage, with a total of 215 projectiles launched by Russia, of which 174 were intercepted by the Ukrainian Air Force. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister called for increased pressure on Moscow and further steps to strengthen Ukraine, labeling Russia a terrorist state. Optimism is low given the human toll and continued aggression.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ruled that Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old convicted killer with dementia, is competent enough to be executed. Menzies was found guilty in 1988 for the 1986 killing of Maurine Hunsaker and chose a firing squad as his method of execution. His lawyers argued that his dementia prevents him from understanding why he is being put to death, and they plan to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. The victim's family expressed relief that justice will finally be served after 37 years of appeals.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., is hosting WorldPride 2025, culminating in a weekend parade that begins in a historic gay neighborhood and concludes at the U.S. Capitol. This marks the first time D.C. has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its inception in 2000, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Pride events in the city. Despite the usual scale of Pride festivities, organizers acknowledge that the current political climate, including executive orders limiting trans rights, has tempered excitement. High-profile corporate sponsors have also declined to support the event due to executive orders targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support for fiscal responsibility, the US national debt continues to climb, with concerns mounting on Wall Street.

Moody's recently downgraded the US credit rating, citing the failure of successive administrations to address large annual fiscal deficits and rising interest costs. The US debt burden is projected to rise to 134% of GDP by 2035, raising questions about the long-term economic stability of the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A case in Georgia is testing the application of the state's fetal 'personhood' law, as a pregnant woman declared brain dead is being kept on life support. Doctors cited legal guidance in compliance with Georgia's abortion laws as the reason for not removing life support. The law, known as the LIFE Act, grants fetuses the same rights as a person, leading to debates about whether removing life support would be equivalent to terminating a pregnancy. This situation highlights the broader implications of 'personhood' laws on medical care and pregnancy outcomes, especially in a state with high maternal mortality rates.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe store prices for rice are "too high," mirroring consumer concerns about the rising cost of this staple food. With prices doubling over the past year, more than 40% of respondents worry that consumers may start avoiding rice altogether. The government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers in an effort to curb prices, but forging a consensus on an appropriate price level remains challenging. The survey also highlights concerns about high farming costs and potential overproduction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is finding it difficult to cut the amount of foreign aid used to pay for hotel bills for asylum seekers, with plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25. This money is primarily used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers in the UK, diverting funds from humanitarian and development priorities across the world. The Home Office aims to reduce costs by speeding up asylum decisions and increasing the availability of dispersal accommodation, but Whitehall officials suggest there is little incentive to reduce ODA spending as it does not affect their budgets.</p>

          <p>Tottenham captain Son Heung-min has lauded sacked manager Ange Postecoglou as a "legend" who "changed the trajectory of this club." Postecoglou was dismissed on Friday, just over two weeks after securing the club's first silverware in 17 years with a Europa League final victory. Son expressed gratitude for Postecoglou's belief in the team and his trust in him as captain. Other players, including Vicario, Van de Ven, and Solanke, also shared their appreciation for Postecoglou's impact on the club.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is increasingly concerned about China's growing influence in Africa, particularly the increasing number of African military officers receiving training in China. General Michael Langley, head of US Africa Command (AFRICOM), noted that the PLA is replicating US training programs for African personnel. This concern arises as the Trump administration shifts its focus from providing military aid to encouraging African countries to be self-reliant. China has become a major supplier of military equipment, especially in the Sahel region, as junta-led leaders move away from Western partners.</p>

          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group is leaving Mali after helping reestablish the Malian junta's control over regional centers, but Russia will maintain its presence through the Africa Corps, a paramilitary force also controlled by Russia. Wagner cited the successful restoration of the country's regional centers to Malian military junta control as the reason for their departure. The Africa Corps, formed with the Russian Defense Ministry's support, will continue to operate in Mali, with many of its members being former Wagner mercenaries.

          <p>The S&P 500 recently achieved a historical milestone, gaining at least 5% in May, which has occurred only seven times in the past 75 years. Historical data indicates that the S&P 500 has been higher 100% of the time one year after such an advance in May, with an average annual return of 19.9%. Despite ongoing volatility-inducing factors like tariff policies and high equity valuations, this historical correlation suggests a positive outlook for the stock market over the next year. Investors are encouraged to remain optimistic and rely on time as an ally, given that bull markets tend to last significantly longer than bear markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The ministry also asserted that the policy violates fundamental principles of international law and deprives millions of people of their right to travel based on nationality or religion.
