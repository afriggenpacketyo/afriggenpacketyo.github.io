          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly offering a $2,500 stipend to unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older to encourage them to leave the United States voluntarily. According to a letter from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the program is part of a broader effort to increase deportations, though officials state it is a strictly voluntary option for children who were often trafficked into the country. Immigration advocates have raised concerns, suggesting the policy could undermine due process and potentially expose the teens to renewed trafficking risks upon their return.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering a design for a $1 coin to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary, featuring former President Donald Trump. A draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, shows Trump with a clenched fist and the words "fight, fight, fight," referencing his response to a past assassination attempt. While a Treasury spokesperson stated the design is not final, they noted it reflects the country's "enduring spirit." The proposal has emerged amid reports of Trump's declining approval ratings.</p>

An amber wind warning remains active for northern Scotland, with gusts recorded as high as 96mph. The storm has also been linked to a weather-related death in the Republic of Ireland, and authorities have closed public spaces like London's royal parks as a safety precaution.</p>

          <p>According to reports, the Israeli military has halted offensive operations in the Gaza Strip to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages as part of a U.S.-brokered peace initiative. An Israeli official clarified this is not a formal ceasefire and that tactical adjustments will be made to protect troops, with a warning that Israel will not permit Hamas to exploit the pause. U.S. envoys are traveling to Egypt to finalize details, while President Trump has issued a warning to Hamas to act quickly on the deal.</p>

Curry, who succeeds the church's first female leader, will helm the largest Lutheran body in the U.S. for a six-year term. His installation comes as the ELCA, like other mainline Protestant denominations, confronts challenges such as declining membership while also working to foster more diverse and multicultural ministries.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have arrested at least 355 people in central London during a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the UK government. The protest went ahead despite calls from police and politicians to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers stated the demonstration was necessary to grieve for Palestinians and that canceling it would mean "letting terror win," while critics called the timing insensitive and a drain on police resources.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown debate, Democrats are actively countering Republican assertions that their funding proposals would provide "free healthcare for illegals." Democratic leaders emphasize that federal law already prohibits the use of programs like Medicaid and the ACA for undocumented immigrants, and their bill does not change this. The Democratic resolution aims to reverse healthcare cuts for lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, who were affected by recent legislation, a nuance they struggle to communicate amid the politically charged rhetoric.</p>

However, the party fell short of an overall majority, meaning Babis will need to form a coalition government to regain the premiership. He is expected to begin negotiations with smaller right-wing, eurosceptic parties, including the anti-immigrant SPD, to build a governing alliance. Key policy areas for a potential coalition include opposition to EU emissions targets and the 2035 ban on new petrol cars.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly being considered for a leading role in a proposed "Board of Peace" to oversee a technocratic government in Gaza, as part of a U.S.-led peace plan. This potential appointment has drawn criticism due to Blair's controversial history in the region, including his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion and his previous tenure as a Middle East envoy. While Blair has described the new peace plan as "bold and intelligent," his potential involvement has been met with skepticism from some Palestinian leaders and UN officials.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the Justice Department's human-smuggling prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García may constitute illegal retaliation. The charges were filed shortly after Ábrego successfully sued the Trump administration over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador, a case that reached the Supreme Court. The judge cited "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general and the timing of the investigation as evidence of potential vindictiveness, ordering a hearing to examine the government's motives for pursuing the case against the Salvadoran national.</p>
