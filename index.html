          <p>A significant security operation is in effect for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to Scotland, where he is staying at his Turnberry golf resort. The US president played a round of golf amid road closures and a heavy police presence, while several hundred demonstrators gathered in Aberdeen and Edinburgh to protest. Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney to discuss trade and international affairs. The visit has raised concerns over security costs and the impact on local police resources.</p>

          <p>The UK government has strongly condemned Hong Kong for offering cash bounties for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression." Hong Kong authorities are offering up to $125,000 for help in apprehending 19 individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law. This action has heightened concerns for the safety of the approximately 150,000 Hong Kong residents who have moved to the UK under a special visa program since 2021.</p>

          <p>So-called "laundrobars," which combine laundry facilities with food, drinks, and entertainment, are becoming more popular, turning a mundane chore into a social experience. While new locations in Brooklyn have recently gained media attention, similar establishments have existed for decades in cities like Reno, Nevada, and Portland, Oregon. Owners report that adding amenities like beer, coffee, and arcade games attracts more customers and creates a community hangout spot. These businesses often face high overhead costs but find success by creating a welcoming, café-like atmosphere and sometimes partnering with other local businesses to manage the food and beverage operations.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has blacklisted the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) for engaging in bid rigging and collusion, suspending it from all military procurement activities. The institute, part of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a crucial research body for technologies like remote sensing, aircraft design, and electronic countermeasures. This is the second time this year the institute has faced such a penalty, having been disqualified from a major project in January. The duration of the current ban was not specified, but the action signals a crackdown on corruption within China's defense contracting sector.</p>

          <p>A routine pre-surgery X-ray led to a terminal diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for Christopher Kennedy, a seemingly healthy 68-year-old. After medications failed and his lung function deteriorated, doctors gave him less than a year to live, but he was approved for a double-lung transplant at age 74. Despite initial hesitation and a challenging wait, Kennedy successfully underwent the procedure at the Cleveland Clinic and has since made a remarkable recovery. Now 75, with his lung capacity at 98%, he is training a new therapy dog named 'Encore' to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the nation is grappling with deteriorating conditions, including increased insecurity and economic distress. The junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, has severed ties with Western powers, aligned with military-led neighbors Mali and Burkina Faso, and cracked down on civil liberties. Many non-governmental organizations have been forced to cease operations, leading to significant job losses in a country already facing high youth unemployment. Human rights groups report a severe decline in freedom of expression, with arbitrary detentions of opposition figures and journalists becoming common.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant rise in loneliness, particularly among its youth, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the pervasive influence of social media. Research indicates that one in five teenagers feels lonely, which can negatively impact their academic performance and social development. Sociologists warn that this isolation can also make young people more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. While single-person households are on the rise, experts caution against directly linking living alone with loneliness, noting that factors like unemployment and poverty are stronger predictors of social isolation across all age groups.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England has led to widespread cancellations of surgeries and appointments, causing significant distress for patients. Individuals, including a man with kidney cancer and the father of a three-year-old needing lung surgery, have shared their stories of frustration and fear that the delays could worsen their conditions. The strike stems from a pay dispute between the British Medical Association (BMA) and the government. While the Health Secretary has aimed to minimize disruption, many patients report that their critical procedures have been postponed indefinitely, leaving them in a state of limbo and uncertainty.</p>

This reaction mirrors the disparagement faced by other female leaders in the region, such as those in Georgia and Moldova.

The article recalls his 1990s prime, when his ambition, style, and success in breaking into mainstream spaces were inspirational for a generation. It notes how Combs made hard work and luxury feel connected and aspirational. However, the author contrasts this powerful image with the recent revelations of his cruelty and depravity, framing his fall as a curdling of childhood dreams and a cautionary tale about role models in popular culture.</p>

          <p>As global temperatures rise, more people are experiencing symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) during the summer, a phenomenon some are calling "summer depression." Unlike winter SAD, which is linked to a lack of sunlight, the summer version is associated with extreme heat, which disrupts sleep, reduces opportunities for exercise and socializing, and can lead to anxiety and restlessness. Americans are increasingly forced to choose between enduring dangerous heat outdoors or staying inside, potentially sacrificing the mental health benefits of sunshine and social activity. Experts worry about the long-term mental health impacts as heat waves become more frequent and intense due to climate change.</p>

The "Great Recall" vote was initiated by a civic movement concerned that the KMT and its allies were blocking government legislation and pushing an agenda too favorable to China. Early results indicate that all targeted lawmakers will retain their seats, meaning the opposition will keep its majority in the legislature, posing a continued challenge for President William Lai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party.

She honors the memory of the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley, whose famously profane protest sign during a previous Trump visit perfectly captured the feelings of many Scots, arguing that this act of defiance is why Trump will never be truly Scottish.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with events at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, by the Second Continental Congress, the institution has been a cornerstone of American communication and unity. The celebration occurs as the agency faces political uncertainty, with recent discussions in the Trump administration about potentially privatizing it or folding it into the Commerce Department. The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated his opposition to privatization, emphasizing the agency's enduring public service role.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if managed carefully. Charging expenses to a rewards card and immediately paying the balance with savings can help couples earn points or miles for a honeymoon. However, with the average wedding cost expected to hit $36,000 in 2025, there is a significant risk of starting a marriage with high-interest debt. Experts caution against carrying a balance, recommending this approach only for those who can pay in full to avoid long-term financial stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is fueling speculation about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While some see it as a one-off financial decision by Paramount, others view it as a sign of decline for the genre, which faces rising costs and dwindling linear TV audiences. The industry is now watching Disney's upcoming decision on Jimmy Kimmel's contract, which expires in 2026. Despite being the highest-rated show in its time slot, Colbert's program operated at an annual loss, highlighting the economic pressures that are reshaping the television landscape.</p>

Roth acknowledges that universities have problems, such as ideological narrowness among faculty and a focus on exclusion, but asserts these are not the real reasons for the assault.

          <p>The proposed Captive Primate Safety Act seeks to make private ownership and breeding of primates illegal across all 50 states, addressing a brutal industry fueled by social media trends. Animal welfare experts and zoo officials state that primates kept as pets suffer from chronic stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage from being isolated from their own kind. The pet trade often begins with poachers killing adult monkeys to steal their babies, many of whom die during smuggling. This legislation, currently in a House committee, is seen by advocates as a key step in protecting primates both in captivity and in the wild.</p>

The violence is part of a long-simmering conflict over land and resources, which has been exacerbated by climate change and a breakdown in traditional peacemaking.

Psychologists and financial advisors note that as income grows, so do expenses and financial anxiety, creating a feeling of being on a "hamster wheel."
