          <p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot detailed France's diplomatic strategy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing the urgent need for a two-state solution to ensure regional stability. He announced France's plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the UN, a move aimed at restarting a threatened political process. Barrot also called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, criticizing the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The article also covers France's stance on the Iran nuclear deal, threatening to reimpose sanctions if a new agreement isn't reached.</p>

          <p>The decision by CBS to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" has raised questions about the viability of the traditional late-night television format amid shifting viewer habits and financial pressures. While Paramount cited financial losses of around $40 million annually, the timing, following Colbert's criticism of a company settlement with Donald Trump, has fueled speculation. The article analyzes the declining ratings and rising costs of late-night shows, noting that Disney's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" faces a similar contract decision next year, which will be a key indicator for the genre's future.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 11:25:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has reportedly ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to cease using polygraph tests in an investigation to identify individuals leaking sensitive information from the Pentagon. The move came after a senior adviser, Patrick Weaver, alerted administration officials that he might be subjected to a test, prompting a direct call to Hegseth. This internal conflict follows a memo authorizing the use of lie detectors to address "unauthorized disclosures of national security information." The directive highlights ongoing tensions and controversies within the Department of Defense under the current administration.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to stop all U.S. funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private organization backed by Israel. In a letter to the Secretary of State, they expressed grave concerns over the GHF's operations, which have been linked to hundreds of Palestinian deaths at aid distribution sites. The senators are calling for a return to UN-led aid mechanisms and are questioning whether oversight rules were bypassed to fast-track $30 million in U.S. support for the controversial group. This reflects growing international and domestic pressure over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Preparations are moving forward to refit a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, donated by the Qatari royal family, for use as Air Force One by President Trump. The plane, valued at $400 million, is slated for donation to the presidential library after Trump's term, but its acceptance has raised constitutional questions regarding gifts from foreign states. Democratic lawmakers have called for an investigation into the matter, citing the Constitution's emoluments clause. Before it can be used, the aircraft will require extensive security checks and renovations that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen analyzes Israel's recent announcement of a "tactical pause" in military activity and aid airdrops in Gaza as a response to intense international condemnation over the starvation crisis. Bowen argues these measures are likely a gesture to horrified allies rather than a fundamental shift in policy, noting that airdrops are an inefficient "act of desperation." He highlights that aid agencies and the UN do not accept Israel's claims that it isn't restricting aid, and they condemn the separate, Israeli-backed GHF distribution system as a deadly "carnage." The analysis concludes that only a full ceasefire and unrestricted land access can truly address the humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas draws on deep personal tragedy for her directorial debut, "My Mother's Wedding," a film about three daughters grappling with loss as their mother prepares to remarry. Thomas reveals that the story is rooted in the pain of her own childhood, having lost her father, a Royal Navy pilot, at age five, and her stepfather five years later in a similar accident. The Oscar-nominated star, known for roles in "The English Patient" and "Slow Horses," co-wrote the screenplay, transforming her feelings of an incomplete past into a creative work starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Increased Effectiveness, Not Just Free Time, Drives Happiness in Four-Day Workweeks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek show that the resulting boost in employee happiness stems from more than just extra time off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that workers feel significantly more effective and productive while on the clock. Faced with a compressed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes and eliminate busywork, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control. This feeling of being good at their jobs positively impacts overall well-being and strengthens team spirit, suggesting a powerful psychological benefit beyond improved work-life balance.</p>

The performance, part of his global tour, has been rescheduled for August 5, and all existing tickets will be honored for the new date. The last-minute cancellation drew frustration from many fans, some of whom described the short notice and reason as a "joke." Drake had already performed two shows in the city and released a new single filmed in Manchester just days prior.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party would seek to ban all NHS doctors from taking strike action if it returns to power. The proposal would introduce legislation for minimum service levels, placing doctors under similar restrictions to police and military personnel. The announcement comes as thousands of resident doctors began a five-day strike over a long-running pay dispute with the government. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that despite recent pay rises, doctors' pay has fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008.</p>

          <p>UK charities are warning that almost £275 million in government-allocated Child Trust Funds (CTFs) intended for young people from low-income backgrounds are currently unclaimed. These tax-free savings accounts were set up for children born between 2002 and 2011, with the government providing an initial deposit. The Share Foundation, a charity that helps locate these funds, reports that over £400 million in total is sitting dormant and is calling for an automatic release mechanism. They argue this would provide an immediate financial injection for young adults at no new cost to the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As France's long-standing "Francafrique" policy of influence in its former African colonies collapses, French companies are being forced to adapt to a new reality. The rise of anti-French sentiment, particularly in the Sahel region, has challenged the preferential treatment these companies once enjoyed, with competitors like China gaining significant market share. In response, some French multinationals like nuclear firm Orano are facing suspensions and license revocations, while others are shifting strategy. Companies are now pursuing more indirect approaches, such as forming joint ventures with local partners or moving operations to non-French-speaking African nations to survive.</p>

The author argues that for Trump, deals are personal, incomplete victories that bolster his brand and feed his ego, whether they are successfully finalized or not. His focus on tariffs is presented as a way to establish personal prestige and dominance over the impersonal forces of the market. Ultimately, the piece concludes that Trump's core motivation is the endless accumulation of money itself, a drive perfectly exemplified by his profitable ventures into cryptocurrency.
