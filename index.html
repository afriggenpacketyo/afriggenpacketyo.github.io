          <p>President Trump announced he would double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill near Pittsburgh. This announcement follows earlier teases of a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a Japanese competitor. Trump characterized the agreement as one that will ensure the American company stays American, adding that the deal includes protections to ensure steel workers keep their jobs. Senator David McCormick provided details on the agreement, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., and that the U.S. would have a golden share.

          <p>Canadian officials are warning of tough days ahead as they battle growing wildfires in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with hot and dry weather forecasted for the weekend. Thousands have been evacuated in the two provinces, which have both declared states of emergency.

Meteorologists forecast that hot and dry conditions will continue, and while a cold front is expected in some parts of Saskatchewan, it will likely miss the regions where the fires are burning.</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 70,000 pounds of honeybee hives overturned in northwestern Washington state, resulting in the escape of approximately 250 million bees. Roads in the area have been closed as bee experts work to manage the situation, aiming to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen. The goal is to save as many bees as possible, considering their critical role in pollination and food production. Bees pollinate over 100 crops, including nuts, vegetables, berries, citrus, and melons.</p>

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution.

The 13-meter radio antenna, jointly developed by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, was inaugurated in Chiang Mai. This telescope, along with a second one under construction in southern Thailand, will improve deep-space tracking and Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research, and earthquake forecasting.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to reinstate an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, potentially impacting millions. The proposal aims to address rising costs by limiting eligibility to those with assets less than $2,000. Disability and health advocates are criticizing the proposal, saying it would sacrifice the health and human services of California's vulnerable populations. Newsom defended the proposed budget cuts, stating the need for fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk lashed out when asked about a New York Times report alleging his frequent use of ketamine during a White House send-off marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration. Musk dismissed the report, questioning the credibility of the New York Times. Musk's remarks came on the same day that the Times reported he used ketamine as often as once a day in 2024, and has also used ecstasy and magic mushrooms at times. The Oval Office back-and-forth came as Musk wrapped up his stint as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, where he oversaw the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey indicated that UK defence spending is expected to increase to 3% of GDP by 2034. This projection aligns with the Prime Minister's plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% by April 2027, with a clear ambition to reach 3% by 2034, contingent on economic conditions. The government is preparing to unveil its strategic defence review, outlining priorities for military and security spending. New funding for defence will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is warning consumers to be cautious of websites claiming to sell rice at heavily discounted prices, as complaints related to such scams have spiked since March. Some consumers reported that rice was never delivered despite payment, with one man in his 20s losing money on a 20 kg order. The average price of rice at supermarkets has risen to a record high, partly due to a poor harvest. The government is attempting to curb prices by releasing rice stockpiles and selling through direct contracts.</p>
