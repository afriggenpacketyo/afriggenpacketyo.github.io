          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a rare, large-scale meeting of senior generals and admirals from across the globe to convene at Quantico, Virginia, on short notice. The Pentagon has offered minimal details about the agenda, leading to speculation about its purpose. Theories range from an announcement of the new National Defense Strategy to discussions about Hegseth's previously stated goal of reducing the number of four-star positions by 20%. The unprecedented nature of the summons has drawn attention, with President Trump expressing his approval of the gathering.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to resume issuing airworthiness certificates for some of its new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a significant step in rebuilding regulatory trust. This authority was revoked in 2019 and 2022 following fatal crashes and production defects, which placed the company under intense scrutiny. The FAA stated the decision follows a thorough review of Boeing's quality control, and its inspectors will now focus on other areas of the production process. The move signals growing confidence in the manufacturer's safety protocols after years of crises.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to introduce a mandatory digital ID system in the UK, which will be required to prove an individual's right to work. The government argues the scheme will help tackle illegal migration and streamline access to public services for citizens. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties and civil liberties groups, who raise concerns about mass surveillance, data security, and its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration. A public consultation on the digital ID, which will be held on smartphones, is set to launch later this year.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention among retirees seeking to ensure their savings last. The rule suggests converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending, balancing security with liquidity. This approach aims to provide a stable, pension-like income stream to reduce stress from market volatility, though it requires careful consideration of interest rates and individual financial circumstances.

          <p>A new Pentagon policy under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requires journalists to sign a 17-page agreement that sharply curtails their news-gathering activities, a move critics call a violation of First Amendment rights. The rules appear to prohibit the publication of unclassified but unapproved information, with the penalty being the revocation of press credentials. This article, written by a veteran Pentagon correspondent, argues that these restrictions break with decades of precedent under both Democratic and Republican administrations, ultimately harming the American public by reducing transparency and accountability for the military.</p>

          <p>Russian officials have reported that at least 19 people have died this month in the western Leningrad region from suspected alcohol poisoning. In response to the deaths in the Slantsy District, authorities have opened a criminal investigation into counterfeit alcohol and detained two individuals. Eight of the deaths have been confirmed as methanol poisoning. Mass fatalities from consuming cheap, illicitly produced alcohol substitutes are a recurring problem in Russia, where high rates of alcoholism persist and the cost of legal spirits can be prohibitive for many.</p>

          <p>An Alabama woman, Summerlin Skipworth, is sharing her story after surviving a life-threatening infection from a flesh-eating bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus. The 30-year-old contracted the bacteria through a small cut on her foot while boating on the Gulf coast, which led to emergency surgery to save her limb. She now faces a yearlong recovery involving daily mobile IV treatments and oral antibiotics. Health officials have noted a growing number of Vibrio infections along U.S. coasts this summer, potentially linked to warmer ocean temperatures, and warn the public about the risks.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina, many communities are still struggling with a slow and arduous recovery.

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, will own less than 20% of the new entity, satisfying the law's foreign ownership limits.
