          <p>Paul Doyle, a 53-year-old father of three and former Royal Marine, has been charged following a car crash at Liverpool's Premier League victory celebration that injured 79 people, including a nine-year-old child. Doyle faces multiple counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, dangerous driving, and unlawful wounding with intent. Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims stated that seven people remain hospitalized and detectives are reviewing CCTV and mobile phone footage as part of the investigation. The Crown Prosecution Service is reviewing the charges to ensure justice for all victims, and the police are working to answer questions about the incident. Optimism for a swift resolution is tempered by the severity of the injuries and the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>The United States' decision to revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly those in critical fields and with connections to the Communist Party, has sparked a backlash from both Americans and Beijing, with accusations of xenophobia. The Chinese embassy in Washington lodged a "solemn dÃ©marche" in response, urging the U.S. government to correct its mistakes and ensure the rights of Chinese students. The State Department defends the decision as crucial for protecting U.S. national security, citing concerns about exploitation of universities and theft of research.

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in China-US rivalry. While he believes full-scale financial sanctions are unlikely, Washington could target specific Chinese entities and gradually expand the scope, potentially excluding China from the US dollar system. Lian suggests that such measures would damage the Swift system, as countries with ties to China would shift to using China's alternative, CIPS. This warning highlights the growing concerns about escalating tensions between the two countries and the potential for financial conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

This attack comes after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, deemed most of his tariffs illegal, leading to a clash with some conservative legal theories. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming they provided bad advice on judicial nominations and that Leo has left to pursue his own ambitions.

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year, largely due to tariffs and tightened border policies, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. Positive sentiment fell from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025, with many companies anticipating a reduction in employee trips and business travel spending. However, global airfares are slightly down, and some regions may benefit from the shift in meeting locations. The report highlights concerns about long-term impacts caused by recent decisions, particularly regarding business travel costs and visa processing issues.</p>

While Trump claims his actions are to protect Jewish students, some fear becoming collateral damage in the crackdown on elite universities. Students worry about the potential impact on their studies and their ability to remain in the U.S. This situation has led to accusations that President Trump has politicized antisemitism.</p>

          <p>President Trump's power to impose tariffs is under threat as a court ruling challenged his authority to unilaterally impose them. The court gave the White House 10 days to remove almost all tariffs, but a federal appeals court has stayed the trade court's ruling. The administration argues that a ruling against Trump would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. This legal battle could significantly impact Trump's economic agenda and his ability to use tariffs as a tool in international trade negotiations.</p>
