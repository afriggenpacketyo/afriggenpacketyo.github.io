            <p>The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, stipulating that detainees must be given due process to challenge their removal. The ruling lifts a temporary restraining order, but the court's majority emphasized that migrants removed under the AEA authority must be given notice and time to seek habeas relief. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision and accusing the administration of subverting the judicial process. This decision highlights the ongoing tensions between the executive branch and the judiciary regarding immigration policy.</p>

            <p>Amid growing economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs, some Republicans in Congress are exploring ways to limit the president's authority over trade policy. Senator Chuck Grassley introduced a bill requiring congressional notification and review of new tariffs, while Representative Don Bacon plans to introduce a companion bill in the House. Support for these measures comes as markets drop and concerns about a potential recession rise.

            <p>The Senate has moved Elbridge Colby's nomination as undersecretary of defense for policy closer to confirmation, despite initial skepticism from some Republican senators. Colby, known for his focus on great power competition with China and authoring the 2018 National Defense Strategy, has garnered support from figures in Trump's circle. His nomination has sparked debate over the U.S. military's strategic priorities in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region.

            <p>China is focusing on increasing household income to offset the economic challenges posed by President Trump's tariffs. While China has made progress in spurring domestic spending through its "dual circulation" strategy, the country's export sector is expected to slow down due to the tariffs. Despite pledges to further open up to global investment and trade, the external environment remains challenging for Chinese exporters due to the high tariffs imposed by the US. This reflects China's efforts to become less vulnerable to external economic shocks.</p>

            <p>A mother and her three children, detained by ICE agents in the hometown of Trump administration's "border czar" Tom Homan, have been released following community outcry. Protests erupted outside Homan's home, and the school principal pleaded for the students' return. The family's detention, part of a larger raid, sparked criticism from advocacy groups and local officials. The incident highlights the human impact of immigration enforcement and the power of community activism.</p>

            <p>Amid conflicting messages from top officials, President Trump states that his sweeping tariffs can be both negotiable and permanent. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he is negotiating with Japan, trade advisor Peter Navarro asserts the policies are "not a negotiation." The mixed messaging has caused confusion and volatility in the markets, with a rumor of a tariff pause briefly spiking stocks before a White House denial sent them back down. The situation underscores the uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies and their potential impact on the global economy.</p>

            <p>Madonna and Elton John have ended their decades-long feud, with Madonna stating they "buried the hatchet" after she went to "confront" him following his performance on Saturday Night Live. The feud stemmed from Sir Elton's repeated accusations that Madonna lip-synced during performances. Madonna said she had been a fan of Sir Elton since she was a teenager and that it hurt her to know he disliked her publicly. She also suggested that the reconciliation may lead to a musical partnership.</p>

Figures like Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have voiced concerns about this trend. Pronatalists believe they have a receptive audience in the White House and are seeking to influence policy. The movement highlights the complex interplay between social, economic, and political factors influencing fertility rates.</p>

            <p>Since Trump's tariffs were implemented, the Dow has fallen significantly, reminiscent of the economic shutdown during Covid-19. As tariffs are set to take effect, a global trade war looms. The President's power over tariffs is largely unchecked, with little prospect of Congress intervening. Economists predict higher prices, slower economic growth, and potential recession. This highlights the real financial shocks from Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding their long-term impact (not investment advice).</p>
