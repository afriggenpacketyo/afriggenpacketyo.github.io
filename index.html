            <p>A British couple, Elaine and Graeme Winn from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, were among the four fatalities in the Naples cable car crash. The incident occurred when a cable snapped, causing the cabin to plunge to the ground. Italian authorities have initiated a criminal investigation, while the cable car operator insists that a safety inspection was successfully completed just two weeks prior to the accident. The other victims include the cable car driver and an Israeli woman, with the woman's brother critically injured. The Mount Faito cable car has a history of accidents, including a similar incident in 1960 that resulted in four deaths.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely watching the US bond market due to volatility sparked by trade tariffs. A rare rise in US government bond rates and a fall in bond prices indicate a loss of investor confidence in the US economy. This situation is drawing comparisons to Liz Truss's mini-Budget, which caused turmoil in the UK bond market. Higher bond yields can lead to increased borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and business loans, potentially slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

These satellites offer high-definition imagery with a 0.5m resolution and a wide swath of 150km, making them more efficient for large-scale monitoring. The company has significantly reduced the weight of the new satellite compared to its predecessor, leading to lower production and launch costs. The company aims to produce high-specification satellites while minimizing costs, weight, and power consumption.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained in north Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law. The court's order prevents the government from removing the detainees until further notice. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit challenging the deportations, arguing that the Venezuelans were not informed of their right to contest the decision in court. The Trump administration had accused the Venezuelans of being gang members and sought to deport them swiftly under the act, which has been invoked only a few times in US history.</p>

The ACLU raised concerns that detainees were being given deportation notices in English, despite some only speaking Spanish, and were not informed of their right to contest the decision.</p>

Pope Francis had previously criticized the administration's deportation plans and corrected Vance's interpretation of Catholic doctrine. Vance, a Catholic convert, has acknowledged the Pope's criticism but maintains his views, while also expressing prayers for the Pope's recovery.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump posted an image that appeared to be digitally altered, claiming it showed tattoos on the hand of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador, proving his gang affiliation. The image, showing the words "MS-13" tattooed on the knuckles, has been questioned by social media users. Trump's post came shortly after a senator's visit to Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, which was followed by the release of photos suggesting a comfortable environment. The case has been marked by conflicting claims and legal battles over Abrego Garcia's deportation.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of gang membership under the Alien Enemies Act, responding to concerns raised by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that the men were at risk of imminent removal to an El Salvadoran prison. This order comes after reports that detainees were being asked to sign removal notices in English, despite some not understanding the language. The Trump administration has been flying Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, where they are being held in a notorious prison, sparking legal challenges.</p>
