          <h2>Millions in China Opt Out of National Health Insurance Amid Economic Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 03:50:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's voluntary national health insurance scheme for rural and unemployed residents saw a significant drop in participation, with nearly 16 million fewer people enrolled in 2024 compared to the previous year. This decline is attributed to rising premiums and stagnating incomes, making the insurance a financial burden for many families, particularly in rural areas. The trend highlights growing pressure on the country's healthcare system, compounded by economic challenges and declining public trust. Experts note that without improvements in economic conditions and income growth, interest in the voluntary scheme is likely to remain low, posing a challenge for public health coverage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant shift in his approach to the war in Ukraine, threatening to impose 100% tariffs on countries doing business with Russia if a peace agreement is not finalized within 50 days. This move, representing a form of secondary sanctions, signals growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Trump said has repeatedly escalated attacks after seemingly positive discussions. The new policy also includes a deal for the U.S. to manufacture weapons for NATO allies, who will then pay for and send them to Ukraine to bolster their defense capabilities, marking a more aggressive stance to pressure Moscow.</p>

          <h2>Constance Marten's Past Linked to Controversial Church Led by Preacher Accused of Abuse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 03:13:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A friend of Constance Marten has revealed that Marten spent four months as a teenage disciple at the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Nigeria, led by the infamous preacher TB Joshua. The friend described the church, which a BBC investigation accused Joshua of using to commit rape and violence, as a "place of torture" and abuse. While there is no suggestion Marten was abused there, messages from years later show she was deeply affected by the experience, which she described as a cult. This background provides context for Marten, who was recently found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter in the death of her baby.</p>

          <p>The Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is currently underway in Morocco, showcasing top talent but also highlighting persistent off-field challenges that hinder its potential. Despite growing investment and rising stars, the tournament suffers from last-minute scheduling, the use of smaller stadiums, and significant pay disparities compared to the men's tournament. Many national teams, including South Africa's, have faced financial disputes over compensation, reflecting a broader issue of inadequate support for women's sports. While the on-field competition is compelling, these organizational problems underscore the hurdles that women's football in Africa must still overcome to achieve equitable recognition and resources.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition has been destabilized after the ultra-Orthodox party United Torah Judaism announced its departure. The exit stems from a contentious dispute over a military draft law that would codify exemptions for their constituents, an issue that has long divided Israeli society. While the move does not immediately collapse the government, it leaves Netanyahu with a slim majority, increasing his reliance on far-right parties who oppose concessions in Gaza ceasefire talks. The political shake-up introduces significant uncertainty at a critical time, as it could complicate negotiations with Hamas and affect the stability of the government moving forward.</p>

          <p>The Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium has become a holding area for thousands of vehicles destined for the United States, as manufacturers pause shipments to avoid steep new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Port data reveals a nearly 16% drop in car and van transport to the US in the first half of 2025, with a more severe 31.5% decline for trucks and heavy equipment. This bottleneck illustrates the immediate and disruptive impact of the 25% tariff on European automakers.

          <p>This article presents an analysis of Donald Trump's second term, arguing that he is aggressively delivering on his campaign promises despite widespread media criticism that he is "destroying democracy." The author contends that actions like sealing the border, imposing high tariffs, and challenging established institutions are framed negatively by the press but are consistent with his electoral mandate. The piece contrasts the media's portrayal of the Biden and Trump presidencies, suggesting a biased "Resistance" framing against Trump. It also touches on the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, noting it as a significant public relations failure for the administration.</p>

The report calls for the creation of a standardized "Antisemitism Training Qualification" and urges that Judaism be understood as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure discrimination is properly addressed. It highlights a specific issue within the NHS, recommending a summit to tackle antisemitism felt by Jewish employees and patients. Other suggestions include improved education in schools to avoid antisemitic tropes and a more consistent policing approach to antisemitic crimes, aiming to apply protections equally to Jewish people.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the crash of Air India Flight 171, which killed 260 people, has sparked controversy and speculation while leaving critical questions unanswered. The report from India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau indicates that two fuel cut-off switches were moved to the 'cut-off' position shortly after takeoff, causing the engines to lose power. However, aviation experts criticize the report for being selective, lacking a full cockpit voice recorder transcript, and not providing context for the pilots' actions. This has led to unverified claims of deliberate action, which pilots' associations have condemned as irresponsible, highlighting that a full and transparent investigation is still needed to determine the cause.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the expiration of protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans under Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The Department of Homeland Security had moved to end the status, which allows them to work legally and shields them from deportation, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved. Immigrant advocacy groups sued the administration, and the court's intervention keeps the protections in place for at least another week while the case is reviewed. The move to revoke TPS for Afghans has drawn criticism, as many of those affected had assisted the U.S. during its two-decade presence in the country.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly 90% of new car sales being electric last year, a stark contrast to less than 1% in 2010. This success is attributed to a long-term strategy of robust government incentives, including VAT exemptions, reduced road and parking taxes, and access to bus lanes. The government has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure and progressively increased taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. This comprehensive approach has made EVs a common sight, improving air quality and reducing noise in cities like Oslo, offering a model for other nations.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te is reportedly planning a "stopover" in the United States this August, potentially visiting New York and Texas while en route to Paraguay. Such a visit is certain to provoke a strong negative reaction from Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province and opposes any official contact between Taiwanese leaders and other nations. Paraguay is one of the few remaining countries that formally recognizes Taiwan. The potential trip comes at a time of already tense US-China relations, and analysts suggest the US could cancel the visit to avoid jeopardizing a potential summit between the US and Chinese presidents.</p>

          <p>Yields on Japanese government bonds have surged to their highest levels in decades, with the 10-year yield hitting a peak not seen since 2008. This spike is driven by growing investor concerns about Japan's fiscal discipline ahead of an upcoming upper house election. Several political parties are proposing consumption tax cuts and increased spending, which could worsen the nation's already massive public debt. This political uncertainty is causing bond investors, or "vigilantes," to demand higher yields to compensate for the perceived risk of fiscal expansion, putting pressure on the government and the Bank of Japan.

The author suggests their experiences with "otherness" and societal transformation have equipped them with a skepticism of grand narratives and a focus on uncovering complex, often uncomfortable, histories. After years of being overlooked, these women are now in positions to exercise power more critically, offering clarity and resisting simplification in their respective fields.</p>
