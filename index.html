        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA will warn physicians about a potential link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use in pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated women should limit its use unless medically necessary, such as for high fevers. However, Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, and major medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly dispute this claim, citing robust scientific evidence that finds no credible link and affirming the drug's safety for pregnant women. The administration also approved the drug leucovorin for treating some autism cases.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries as a government shutdown deadline approaches on September 30. The meeting follows requests from the Democratic leaders, who have refused to support Republican funding proposals that do not address their healthcare priorities. Competing short-term funding bills failed in the Senate last week, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. President Trump has publicly acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown but expressed doubt that a meeting would change the outcome of the partisan impasse.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew in New York to discuss a potential $10 billion investment by the company to build a major data center in Brazil. The proposed project, located in the Pecém Industrial and Port Complex in Ceará, would be one of the largest technology infrastructure investments in the country's history. This development aims to leverage Ceará's strategic position as a hub for transatlantic data cables connecting South America with North America, Europe, and Africa.

          <p>Disney announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, nearly a week after its indefinite suspension. The company stated the initial decision was made to avoid inflaming tensions following Kimmel's comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement. The reinstatement comes after discussions between Disney executives and Kimmel, and amid significant public outcry from entertainers and civil liberties groups who framed the suspension as a threat to free speech. The host is expected to address the controversy upon his return to the late-night show.</p>

The 27-year-old was recognized as the world's best female footballer, continuing a five-year streak of Barcelona players winning the prestigious award. Bonmati's win follows a remarkable season where she was instrumental for both her club and the Spanish national team, despite a pre-Euro 2025 health scare with viral meningitis. Her international teammate Mariona Caldentey finished second in the voting.</p>

          <p>A new online phenomenon dubbed "chatbait" is emerging, where AI chatbots employ tactics similar to clickbait to keep users engaged in conversations.

This strategy helps AI companies gather valuable training data and build product loyalty. While often just a minor annoyance, this push for continuous engagement raises concerns about the potential for harmful or manipulative conversations, especially in sensitive situations.</p>

          <p>A sense of unease is growing within the Department of Justice as President Trump openly directs the agency to investigate his political rivals, including former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. This follows the recent departure of a top federal prosecutor in Virginia who reportedly felt pressured to pursue charges desired by the president. Former DOJ attorneys and legal experts express concern that these actions erode the rule of law and the department's traditional independence, creating fear among career employees and testing the ethical obligations of political appointees.</p>

          <p>England's Hannah Hampton, who was recently named the world's best female goalkeeper at the Ballon d'Or ceremony, has overcome significant adversity in her career. Born with a serious eye condition that causes depth perception issues, doctors initially told her she should not play football. Despite this, she rose through the ranks, switching from striker to goalkeeper and developing exceptional skill with her feet. After being dropped from the national team following the Euro 2022 victory, she successfully rebuilt her career, culminating in her heroic, title-winning performance at Euro 2025.</p>

Regulators also allege that Amazon intentionally complicated the cancellation process to retain subscribers.

          <p>Two months after the Dragon Bravo Fire ignited in Grand Canyon National Park, questions remain about the National Park Service's initial response. The fire, which started on July 4, ultimately destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 100 other structures, causing significant economic damage to local communities. While an emergency response team found that much of the burn area was of low severity and beneficial for forest health, lawmakers are demanding an investigation into why the fire was not more aggressively suppressed from the start. The Park Service has stated a comprehensive review is underway.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok by moving its American operations into a new U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American owners and board members. A senior official stated that software company Oracle will provide comprehensive security, including for the app's powerful algorithm, which will be continuously monitored. Although the White House expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement. The plan is intended to address national security concerns that prompted Congress to pass a law requiring the app's divestment.</p>
