          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to increase due to changes in the economy and policy uncertainties. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with long-term inflation expectations near the Fed's 2% target. He highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for both the economy and central banks. Powell also mentioned that tariffs could slow growth and boost inflation, but the extent of the impact remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief, but it also has long-term consequences, especially regarding lenders' perceptions. Settling debt for less than the full amount is a major red flag for credit card issuers, making them hesitant to extend new credit. If a credit card was included in the debt settlement agreement, that account was almost certainly closed. While other accounts may remain open, debt settlement can significantly damage your credit score, potentially leading other creditors to reduce credit limits or deny future transactions. </p>

          <p>Stephen A. Smith, the prominent ESPN sports analyst, is campaigning for a crossover American media ubiquity and influence, teasing a potential 2028 presidential run. He is seeking to emulate Joe Rogan's political clout while remaining a top sports commentator. Smith has been discussing political topics on his podcast, hosting Democrats and MAGA luminaries, and engaging in debates on issues like federal tariff policy. He is leveraging his large audience and performance skills to gain influence in the political arena, although his personal politics are described as a bespoke centrism.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the U.S. could face an increase in supply shocks, speaking a week after the central bank held interest rates steady amid economic uncertainty. Powell stated that the economic environment has changed since the Fed's last strategy meeting in 2020, with longer-term interest rates now higher. He also warned that higher real rates could unleash greater inflation volatility than what the U.S. experienced during the "inter-crisis period of the 2010s". Powell's comments come as consumers and businesses grapple with economic uncertainty due to the Trump administration's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to achieve a basic standard of living is growing, with the bottom 60% of U.S. households unable to afford a "minimal quality of life". The report, from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP), considers the costs of necessities like food and shelter, as well as technology, education, and health care. The group also says that the nation's official unemployment rate of 4.2% greatly understates the level of economic distress around the U.S.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold is best approached as adding a small but critical component to a portfolio rather than following a strict investment schedule. The conventional wisdom is that gold shouldn't make up more than 10% of the overall portfolio. How often one should invest is determined by how much money they have to invest and how those investments will be spread out over time to get to that 10% maximum. Waiting to get invested in gold is generally not advisable, as over time, the price only increases. (not investment advice)</p>
