This visit occurred just as China was beginning its era of 'reform and opening up,' which sparked decades of rapid economic and technological growth.

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, a distinguished member of the Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As one of the last surviving pilots from America's first Black military aviation unit, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II. His extensive military career also included service in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, flying a total of 136 combat missions across three conflicts. After retiring, Hardy became a dedicated advocate for preserving the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its economic growth strategy. A taskforce has identified Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve proposed locations. This initiative is central to Labour's pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, addressing the nation's housing crisis. The plan aims for at least 40% of the new homes to be classified as affordable housing, with development corporations overseeing the projects.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of U.S. troops to Portland, Oregon, stating he has authorized the use of "full force" if necessary. The stated purpose is to protect federal immigration facilities from what he described as attacks by "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." The announcement has drawn strong criticism from Oregon's governor and other Democratic lawmakers, who argue there is no national security threat in the city and view the move as an abuse of power intended to provoke conflict. The Pentagon has confirmed it is ready to mobilize personnel at the president's direction.</p>

          <p>As Major Hurricane Humberto churns in the Atlantic, meteorologists are observing its potential interaction with another developing storm system nearby. This proximity raises the possibility of a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect, where two storms orbit a common center and can sometimes merge. While forecasts suggest Humberto will not make landfall, its path could be altered if it engages with the weaker system, expected to be named Imelda. This complex weather scenario is being closely watched for its potential, though unlikely, impact on storm tracks and intensity.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve by posting a cartoon image on social media depicting him firing Chairman Jerome Powell. The post, which shows Trump shouting "YOU'RE FIRED!" at Powell, reflects his ongoing frustration with the central bank's cautious approach to interest rate cuts. While largely symbolic, the action renews questions about the Fed's independence from political pressure, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability. Legal experts and a recent Supreme Court decision suggest a president does not have the authority to remove a Fed chair at will. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a broad consensus that a severe housing shortage is driving California's affordability crisis, experts and agencies disagree on its actual size. Estimates for the number of missing housing units in the state range dramatically, from as low as 56,000 to as high as 3.5 million. This wide variation is due to different methodologies, such as calculating the units needed to stabilize prices, accommodate 'pent-up' demand from people living with family, or achieve a 'healthy' vacancy rate. While the exact number is debated, the consensus remains that a massive increase in housing construction is necessary to address the problem.</p>

They also cited reports of poor conditions at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, including inadequate medical care and recent detainee deaths.</p>

In a veiled reference to China, he also emphasized the need for 'de-risking' supply chains for critical minerals.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. Earhart and her navigator vanished over the Pacific Ocean during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe, a mystery that has captivated the public for nearly 90 years. While the prevailing theory is that her plane ran out of fuel and crashed, other hypotheses, including that she was on a spy mission and captured, have persisted. It remains unclear what classified information, if any, the government possesses regarding her fate.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly dismissed a group of 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. According to media reports, the termination letters cited a "lack of judgement" as the reason for the firings. The action of 'taking a knee' became a symbol of protest against police brutality and racial injustice. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the dismissals, asserting that the agents' rights were violated, while the move is seen by some as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to remove perceived left-wing influences from federal agencies.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores how former President Donald Trump's strategy of openly acknowledging and often boasting about controversial actions has altered the American public's perception of political scandal. Unlike past presidents who sought to conceal misconduct, Trump frequently broadcasts his intentions, such as pressuring the Justice Department to investigate rivals. Observers argue this brazenness can be perversely seen as authenticity by his supporters and numbs the public to actions that were once career-ending. This approach, combined with a rapid news cycle and loyal party support, has allowed him to weather numerous crises that might have toppled his predecessors.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume fruit containing naturally fermented alcohol, ingesting a daily amount equivalent to about one small bottle of beer for a human. Researchers analyzing fruit varieties in Uganda and the Ivory Coast found an average alcohol content of 0.3% in the ripe pulp. This finding suggests that alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots in primates rather than being a purely human cultural phenomenon. The observation supports the theory that an attraction to ethanol could be linked to our shared ancestry with great apes.</p>
