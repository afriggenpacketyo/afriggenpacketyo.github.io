            <p>Iris Enriquez, a 26-year-old woman from Faribault, Minnesota, is believed to be the only person in the world with a unique, unnamed genetic disorder caused by a duplication in her 13th chromosome. In addition to the rare genetic condition, Enriquez lives with chronic kidney disease, neurofibromatosis, scoliosis, and Raynaud's phenomenon, but her mother emphasizes that Iris's difference is a gift and that their faith helps them get through the challenges. Iris works at First Baptist School in Rosemount with her mother and enjoys being around people and listening to music. Her mother considers her a teacher who has saved her life, particularly since she had Iris at a young age and had to grow up quickly.</p>

            <p>California is defying a Trump administration order requiring school districts to certify the elimination of all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, arguing that such programs do not violate civil rights laws. The California Department of Education sent a letter to school districts defending the legality of DEI efforts and challenging the federal agency's request as vague. Sixteen states are attempting to comply with the order, while ten others have refused. California officials assert they already comply with federal law through existing assurance and monitoring mechanisms, while also defending a state law protecting students' rights related to gender identity.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to block their access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. The firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in a high-profile case against Fox News, argues that the executive order is an abuse of power and retaliation for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. Susman Godfrey asserts that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies, as at least a third of their current matters require such interactions.</p>

Meanwhile, Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting the country could be partitioned, clarifying that he was referring to a post-ceasefire resiliency force.

            <p>The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing Garcia back, but also said Judge Paula Xinis may have exceeded her authority. Garcia, a Salvadoran, was one of dozens of alleged gang member migrants placed by the US on military planes last month and flown to El Salvador's notorious Cecot (Terrorism Confinement Centre) under an arrangement between the two countries.</p>

            <p>The UK government is poised to take control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, which is at risk of imminent closure, prompting MPs to return from their Easter break to pass emergency legislation. British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's entire workforce, and is the last plant in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The company says the plant continues to lose £700,000 a day despite £1.2bn of investment and has begun a 45-day consultation on job cuts.</p>

Memories of a Lost Future," chronicles the events leading to Venezuela’s socioeconomic crisis and explores the hopeful future that Venezuelans failed to attain. The book argues that people are not very aware of what democracy means and why its preservation is important. Osío Cabrices highlights the idea of providing a deeper and more nuanced understanding of a country that lost a quarter of its population in less than a decade. He argues that democracy can’t be taken for granted and that it’s not like adulthood, a stage you reach that you don’t leave.</p>

The US president insisted his tariff war was going “really well” despite mounting fears of recession and Beijing raising its retaliatory tariffs on the US to 125%.</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system, impacting the code to exempt freight from new Trump administration tariffs, has been fixed after lasting for over 10 hours. The glitch affected the Automated Commercial Environment, preventing the acceptance of the lower duty rate of 10% for entries that qualified as in-transit shipments. Customs has advised users to resubmit applicable entry summaries. The tariffs, being paused on many nation's trade, and the Chinese tariffs still in effect, are based on the sailing date, or the date the freight leaves the factory or warehouse.</p>
