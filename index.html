          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The firm is accused of manipulating the Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices by making large, coordinated trades in stocks and options to artificially influence prices for profit. While Jane Street disputes the findings, SEBI's interim order cites the "intensity and sheer scale" of the firm's actions as a threat to market integrity. The move comes as India's booming derivatives market attracts more global firms, prompting increased regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after a landslide victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party is confronting significant challenges, including stagnant economic growth and falling public approval. The government has struggled to deliver on economic promises, while high inflation and borrowing costs continue to pressure households. Despite some foreign policy successes, such as trade deals with the US and EU, domestic issues and policy U-turns have damaged the party's credibility. The article notes the rising popularity of the rival Reform UK party reflects widespread public disaffection with the political establishment.</p>

          <p>In an interview reflecting on his first year as Prime Minister, Keir Starmer addressed a series of policy U-turns, particularly on welfare reform, framing them as pragmatic adjustments rather than weaknesses. He acknowledged that the process for his welfare plans was flawed and took responsibility for the recent difficulties, which have fueled speculation about his chancellor's future. The article portrays Starmer as determined to highlight his government's achievements, such as reducing NHS waiting lists and securing trade deals. He insists that changing his mind based on new information is a common-sense approach to leadership.</p>

According to nonpartisan analysis, the bill is projected to add approximately $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Prosecutors argued the woman was unable to give consent, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, further fueling speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. His tour will cover eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, a move the state's Democratic Party chair says is aimed at showing these voters they are not forgotten. While a political advisor denies presidential ambitions, insisting the focus is on the 2026 midterms, the trip follows several other overtures by Newsom to voters in southern states, including a high-profile debate with Florida's governor.</p>

Lead singer Pedro Tovar posted a video lamenting the treatment of immigrants and announced the band's intention to participate in a benefit concert for affected families. In an interview, the band members, who are children of immigrants, also discussed their new independently produced album, "Vibras de Noche II." They attribute their grounded nature, despite massive success with hits like "Ella Baila Sola," to their family's guidance.</p>

          <p>For the first time, scientists in China have successfully grown a beating heart structure composed of human cells inside a pig embryo. Researchers from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health announced that the human-cell-derived heart continued to beat unaided for 21 days. The team achieved this by reprogramming human stem cells with genes designed to prevent cell death, then implanting them into pig embryos at an early stage. This breakthrough in chimera research follows the same team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs for up to 28 days.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit that challenges the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren and other ranking Democrats, the brief argues the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish a federal agency established by Congress. The lawsuit was filed after the administration took steps to downsize the department, including a significant workforce reduction and pausing over $6 billion in congressionally appropriated education programs, which critics argue harms students and educators nationwide.</p>

Residents are advised to avoid swimming, surfing, or any activity involving water contact at specific locations, including areas of Santa Monica Beach, Mothers Beach in Marina Del Rey, and Avalon Beach on Catalina Island. The warnings were prompted by tests indicating that recent street runoff has contaminated the ocean water. Officials warn that swimming in the affected areas can lead to illness or skin infections, particularly for children and the elderly.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the National Park Service to charge higher entrance fees for foreign visitors while keeping prices low for American citizens. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee increase, which the administration estimates could generate over $90 million annually to fund park improvements. The directive also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park lotteries or permitting systems. As part of the same order, Trump revoked an Obama-era memorandum that promoted diversity and inclusion at national parks, continuing his administration's rollback of such federal initiatives.</p>

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the man is being investigated by relevant agencies to determine his identity and reasons for crossing.

          <p>Veterans, military families, and legal scholars are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of troops for domestic law enforcement, such as in Los Angeles, erodes democratic norms and harms service members. In a news conference, advocates argued that using the military in this capacity violates the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from civilian law enforcement. Speakers noted that troops are not trained for community policing and that the missions place them in an inappropriate role against American citizens.

According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the 56,000 people currently detained by ICE do not have a criminal record, a number that has nearly doubled since May. This trend contradicts administration claims of focusing on the "worst of the worst," instead showing a broader crackdown on individuals whose only offense is their immigration status. The article highlights the case of a pastor with no criminal history who was recently deported after living in the U.S. for 30 years.</p>

          <p>Advocacy groups are raising alarms that staffing cuts at U.S. national parks could pose safety risks for summer visitors. The National Parks Conservation Association reports that the National Park Service (NPS) has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration began, leading to issues like lifeguard shortages at popular sites like Assateague Island National Seashore. These cuts are attributed to a federal hiring freeze and a push to reduce the size of government. Critics fear that with fewer rangers, lifeguards, and other personnel, the safety of millions of park visitors could be compromised.</p>
