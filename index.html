          <p>Singapore's passport has again been named the most powerful globally for 2025, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries, according to the latest Henley Passport Index. This continues the city-state's dominance in the rankings, which are based on data from the International Air Transport Association. In contrast, the report highlights a continued decline for both the United States and United Kingdom passports, which once held top positions but have now slipped to tenth and sixth place, respectively. The rankings underscore a significant shift in global mobility, with Asian and European nations dominating the top tiers.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are urging Chinese firms to more deeply integrate with local economies in Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to navigate new U.S. trade policies. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs, some as high as 40%, on goods suspected of being transshipped through countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained locally, Chinese businesses can create more stable, long-term operations that are less vulnerable to unpredictable tariff shifts. This strategy is seen as a necessary adaptation to the escalating trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A preliminary autopsy has determined that a 9-year-old Canadian girl, Melina Galanis Frattolin, died from asphyxia due to drowning, with her death ruled a homicide by New York State Police. Her father, Luciano Frattolin, has been charged with second-degree murder after allegedly fabricating a kidnapping story. The pair had crossed into the U.S. for a vacation, but the girl's body was later found in a shallow pond in Ticonderoga. Authorities are now seeking public assistance for any information or video footage related to the family's vehicle.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail. The deputies, identified as Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, had a combined 74 years of service. According to senior officials, the incident occurred while the bomb squad was working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a separate location the previous day. The event marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, and a multi-agency investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the tragic blast.</p>

          <p>A Jacksonville, Florida, police officer has been suspended after a viral video showed him punching a driver during a traffic stop. The driver, William McNeil Jr, filmed the officer smashing his car window and striking him before pulling him from the vehicle. Police later released bodycam footage showing McNeil refusing commands to exit the car after being stopped for traffic violations. While a state prosecutor found no criminal misconduct by the officers, an internal review is ongoing, and civil rights attorney Ben Crump is representing McNeil, calling the incident a disturbing example of police violence.</p>

The agreement, described by President Trump as one of the "largest ever," is also expected to see Japan invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to more American goods. The news prompted a major surge in the stock prices of Japanese automakers like Toyota and Honda, providing relief to an industry that had been hit hard by previous tariff threats.

This policy shift effectively bars transgender women from competing in women's Olympic sports and aligns with a similar move by the NCAA.

          <p>Capital One's stock value increased following its latest earnings report, despite complex financial results due to its recent acquisition of Discover. Although the deal led to a reported net loss under standard accounting principles, adjusted earnings per share significantly beat estimates, signaling strong underlying performance. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the rare strategic advantage of owning a payments network, a move that is central to the company's future growth. Investors appear to be buying into this long-term vision, focusing on future synergies and earnings potential rather than the short-term accounting complexities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man who allegedly drove his car into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub has been charged with 37 counts of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. The suspect, Fernando Ramirez, had reportedly been ejected from the Vermont Hollywood nightclub before returning and plowing his vehicle into dozens of people, injuring at least 36. After the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the car and assaulted him before he was taken into custody. Prosecutors stated it was a "miracle" no one was killed in the incident, which could result in a life sentence if Ramirez is convicted.</p>

          <p>One month after Israeli airstrikes targeted Iran's notorious Evin Prison, transferred inmates are reporting inhumane and unbearable conditions at other facilities. Families of political prisoners moved to Fashafouyeh Prison describe severe overcrowding, a lack of beds and air conditioning, and insect infestations. The strikes, which Iran called a "war crime," killed 80 people and led to the evacuation of all inmates from the Tehran facility. Human rights groups and prisoners' accounts suggest that conditions in the destination prisons are significantly worse, compounding the suffering of those detained.</p>

The author contends this is part of a pattern, including the firings of other high-ranking female officers, driven by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's views on "social engineering." The piece concludes that these actions send a message that women are not welcome in top leadership roles, undermining military readiness and morale.</p>

Habba had been serving in an interim capacity, but her tenure expired as the judges opted to replace her with career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace. The move is a significant rebuke of the Trump administration's pick, who had faced strong opposition from New Jersey's Democratic senators over her lack of prosecutorial experience and actions they deemed politically motivated.
