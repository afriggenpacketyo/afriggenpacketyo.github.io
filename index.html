            <p>Walmart has retracted its operating income forecast for the first quarter, citing considerable ambiguity surrounding the potential effects of extensive tariffs imposed on goods from China, Vietnam, and other significant sourcing countries. This decision reflects the company's intention to maintain pricing flexibility amidst tariff implementations. While maintaining its sales outlook, Walmart acknowledges the difficulty in predicting operating income due to consumer sentiment decline and sales volatility. The company remains focused on long-term growth strategies despite the current economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Apple's stock experienced a more than 3% surge, recovering from its most severe four-day losing streak since 2000.

            <p>U.S. stock markets experienced volatility as they oscillated between gains and losses amid growing fears of a global trade war. This volatility was triggered by retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and the European Union in response to President Trump's levies on goods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both declined, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq managed a slight gain. The escalating trade tensions have also caused a selloff in U.S. Treasury markets, raising concerns about safe-haven assets.</p>

The 10-year Treasury note yield has jumped significantly, reaching its highest level since February, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield has hit a high not seen since November 2023. This bond sell-off coincides with President Trump's new tariffs, which have already sent stock prices lower amid recession concerns.

            <p>The stock market rallied on Wednesday, amid morning volatility as investors nervously eye President Trump's growing trade war, which threatens to raise prices for U.S. consumers and blunt economic growth. China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good went into effect today at a rate of 104%. The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war, which Wall Street economists warn could raise the risk of a global recession and hurt U.S. corporations and consumers by hiking prices on products from almost every nation.</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has expressed concerns that the U.S. economy is likely headed for a recession due to President Trump's tariffs. Dimon noted that the significant decline in the stock market is a contributing factor, as it negatively impacts consumer sentiment and spending. JPMorgan economists now anticipate a contraction in U.S. GDP this year. While Dimon previously supported tariffs, he now encourages the U.S. to negotiate trade deals to avoid further economic deterioration. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Investor confidence in the US economy is plummeting as growing concerns over the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs prompted a sell-off of government debt. The interest rate on bonds spiked sharply to touch the highest level since February at 4.5%. Trump has gone ahead with sweeping tariffs on goods being imported into the US, while Washington's trade war with Beijing has escalated. Analysts suggested that America's central bank might be forced to step in if turbulence continues.</p>

            <p>The second Trump administration is characterized by chaos and conflicting agendas, with two primary visions battling for control: national conservatism and tech capital. National conservatives seek to rebuild a past America, while tech capital aims to advance its own priorities. These projects clash on issues like tariffs, with national conservatives supporting them to rebuild manufacturing and tech capital opposing them. This internal conflict threatens to undermine the administration's policies and harm the American working class.</p>

While the wealthy hold a disproportionate share of stock, a majority of Americans have money tied to the market through retirement accounts. This broad exposure means a plunging market inflicts pain on individuals across income levels, particularly those nearing retirement. The tariffs are projected to reduce disposable income for the average US household and potentially lead to job losses.</p>

The lack of agreement between the Druze and the government, along with rising sectarian violence, threatens efforts to build a united Syria.
