        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with record high rice prices due to a poor harvest in 2023, Japanese supermarket chains like Aeon, Ito-Yokado, and Seiyu are expanding their offerings of foreign-grown rice, including rice from California and Taiwan, to provide more affordable options for consumers. Aeon plans to sell California-sourced rice at approximately 15% less than the average price of Japanese-grown rice, aiming to increase overall rice consumption by giving customers a choice. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan hailed Aeon's commitment to American rice farmers as "historic," acknowledging Japan's discerning standards for food quality. The average price of rice at Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, prompting the government to consider measures to stabilize prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes starting June 1st, many vapers are panic-buying to stockpile their preferred devices. Concerns over environmental impact and youth vaping have driven the ban, but some ex-smokers like Baroness Claire Fox credit disposable vapes with helping them quit smoking, finding rechargeable alternatives less appealing due to taste issues. Retailers are seeing sales surge as customers stock up, while some worry about the ban's impact on their businesses and the potential return to traditional cigarettes for some vapers. A Censuswide poll indicates that while many disposable vape users will switch to rechargeable devices or quit vaping, a significant percentage plan to stockpile or revert to smoking.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance during recent trade talks with U.S. officials. Akazawa emphasized the need to remove additional tariffs imposed on Japan and discussed economic security issues such as supply chains. In a related development, Trump approved Nippon Steel's plan to buy U.S. Steel, signaling potential progress in trade relations. While Japan maintains its stance that all additional tariffs should be eliminated, there are indications that they may be willing to compromise to secure an early deal.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available at 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This move comes amid mounting criticism of the government's failure to curb rising rice prices. The government plans to release 300,000 tons initially and may provide additional supplies if necessary. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, nearly double last year's level.</p>

Meteorologists emphasize that weather balloons provide irreplaceable data on air pressure and moisture that cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar.

          <p>King Charles is preparing for a historic visit to Canada, where he will become the first monarch to open Canada's Parliament in nearly 70 years. The visit comes amid pressure from US President Trump, who has suggested that Canada should be part of the US. The King is expected to deliver a speech emphasizing Canadian sovereignty and independence. The speech will balance a message of solidarity with Canada without jeopardizing the UK's relationship with the US.</p>

          <h2>Trump's 'Golden Dome' Missile Defense System Faces Challenges</h2>

          <p>President Trump's plan to build a "next generation" missile shield, dubbed the "Golden Dome," faces significant challenges due to its high cost and logistical complexity. Experts agree that bolstering America's missile defenses is necessary to counter advanced threats from Russia and China, including hypersonic weapons and fractional orbital bombardment systems. The Golden Dome would involve multiple layers of defense across land, sea, and space, but the details remain conceptual. The US would need space based platforms to provide even a minimal defence against incoming missiles.</p>
