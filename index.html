          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is sending GPU designs to China for modification in response to recent U.S. export curbs. A spokesperson clarified that Nvidia is not altering GPU designs to comply with export controls. The Financial Times had reported that CEO Jensen Huang discussed a potential R&D center in Shanghai with the city's mayor to assess ways to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market, but Nvidia maintains that production and design will continue outside of China. This move comes as the U.S. government has tightened restrictions on the export of advanced technology to China.</p>

The statue, a replacement for a wooden sculpture that was burned down earlier in the year, was sawed off at the ankles and removed.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a since-deleted Instagram post featuring the numbers "8647." Trump and his allies claim Comey knew the numbers meant 'assassination,' a charge Comey denies, stating he was unaware of the violent association and assumed it was a political message. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service opened an investigation into Comey's post, which Comey removed after realizing the potential for misinterpretation. Comey maintains he opposes violence of any kind.</p>

The judge described the attack as brazen and carried out in broad daylight in front of families and police. Ms. Maximen's family expressed that justice had been served, but that no sentence is long enough for her killer, as the victim's daughter witnessed her mother's murder.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, effectively shutting down train service and impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from disagreements over pay raises, with the union asserting that NJ Transit's compensation lags behind competitors and does not account for the rising cost of living. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan involving additional bus service, but it is expected to accommodate only a fraction of the usual train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate disruptions, but commuters are advised to work from home if possible.</p>

The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The gap between earnings and the cost of living is widening, with the cost of basic economic security doubling since 2001. The report also suggests that the official unemployment rate significantly understates the level of economic distress in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is accused of misleading a judge to gain access to the homes of Columbia University students, allegedly targeting them for their pro-Palestinian activism. A recently unsealed search warrant application reveals that ICE claimed it was investigating Columbia University for "harboring aliens" as a pretext to arrest and deport two students. Attorneys argue that the agency manufactured the allegation to justify entering residences without a legitimate warrant. One of the students has been granted temporary protection from deportation as the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts are warning that the U.S. Department of Education's decision to resume collections on defaulted student loans under President Donald Trump could significantly impact low-income consumers. JPMorgan estimates that disposable personal income could be collectively reduced by between $3.1 billion and $8.5 billion every month due to these collections. This policy change, combined with existing pressures from Trump's tariff plan and high inflation, may strain consumers who are already struggling financially. Bank of America suggests that the subprime consumer segment will be particularly affected.</p>

          <p>A new report suggests that individuals and small businesses may bear some of the costs associated with grid upgrades needed to support large electricity users, such as data centers. The report found that payments from large energy users may not fully cover the cost of new infrastructure, potentially leading utilities to spread the remaining expenses to other ratepayers or absorb them themselves. Rapid growth in data centers and increased use of electric vehicles are straining electricity grids, contributing to rising electricity rates. Some states, like Texas, have policies to protect individuals and small businesses from higher rates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's trade truce with China isn't providing much relief to importers, as the stacking of multiple tariff layers has significantly increased import costs for retail goods. The layering of existing tariffs, Section 301 tariffs, and new tariffs related to fentanyl and reciprocal measures can result in total tariff rates ranging from 40% to 70% for many items. This tariff stacking has led some small businesses to cut product lines and retailers to warn of potential price increases for consumers. The high cost of these import taxes are unsustainable for both American families and footwear companies.</p>
