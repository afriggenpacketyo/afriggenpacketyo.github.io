          <p>Oakland Athletics outfielder Brent Rooker humorously reacted on social media after ESPN's Jeff Passan suggested a different lineup for the MLB All-Star game's first-ever swing-off tiebreaker. Passan's preferred list did not include Rooker, who participated in the event, prompting the player to jokingly ask if he wasn't good enough. Rooker later clarified his comment was in jest, admitting he would also have chosen the players Passan listed over himself. The exchange highlighted a lighthearted moment amid discussions about player selections for the new All-Star format.</p>

          <h2>Documentary 'Afternoons of Solitude' Offers an Unflinching Look at Bullfighting</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary, "Afternoons of Solitude," from Spanish director Albert Serra, provides a stark and immersive view into the world of bullfighting, following star matador Andrés Roca Rey. The film avoids explaining or contextualizing the controversial tradition, instead using long, focused takes to present its ornate rituals and gruesome realities. The review praises the film as a "spellbinding, immersive work" that captures both the palpable danger for the matador and the horror of the bull's fate. It intertwines meditation and obscenity to honestly portray the brutality at the heart of this ancient practice.</p>

          <p>A complex prisoner swap between the United States, Venezuela, and El Salvador has resulted in the release of ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela. The deal involved El Salvador returning 252 Venezuelan nationals, who had been deported from the U.S. and held in a high-security prison, to Venezuela. Among the freed Americans is former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda, whose family stated he was an innocent man used as a political pawn. In return for the Venezuelans, the Maduro regime also released dozens of its own political prisoners.</p>

          <p>During the second round of The Open, Irish golfer Shane Lowry received a two-stroke penalty after officials determined his ball moved during a practice swing in the rough. Lowry stated he did not see the ball move and expressed frustration over the lack of definitive camera angles, but ultimately accepted the penalty to protect his reputation. The R&A, the sport's governing body, explained that video evidence showed the ball's movement was discernible to the naked eye, which is the standard for the rule. The penalty changed Lowry's score from a 70 to a 72, leaving him further behind the tournament leader.</p>

          <p>Over 200 Venezuelan migrants, controversially deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison, have been sent to Venezuela as part of a major prisoner exchange. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the deal, which also secured the release of 10 Americans and numerous political prisoners held by Venezuela. The migrants were initially deported under the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, with many families denying the U.S. government's claims of gang affiliation. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the maneuver, suggesting the administration was trying to avoid judicial accountability for detaining the individuals without due process.</p>

          <p>PBS and NPR are confronting a severe financial crisis after Congress approved a Trump administration proposal to cancel $1.1 billion in previously budgeted federal funds. The move is expected to force layoffs and programming cuts, with the most significant impact on smaller, rural stations that rely heavily on federal support. Acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns warned that many educational projects will no longer be possible, while PBS President Paula Kerger stated that local stations providing unique programming and emergency alerts will face difficult decisions.

          <p>President Trump's administration struggled internally with how to handle the persistent news cycle surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, initially resisting calls to release more information. Trump reportedly felt betrayed by his own supporters for fueling the story and was frustrated by his inability to change the topic. However, after The Wall Street Journal published a story about a bawdy letter Trump allegedly sent Epstein, the president reversed course. He then publicly asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to move to unseal grand jury testimony, a move seen as an attempt to regain control of the narrative.</p>

CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been personally recruiting top researchers with massive compensation packages to build what he calls "personal superintelligence for everyone." This overhaul comes as Meta's previous AI models, like Llama, have struggled to match the performance of rival chatbots.

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested that a federal judge unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move comes after a recent DOJ memo concluding Epstein had no "client list" and died by suicide sparked backlash from Trump's supporters, who demanded more transparency. The filing argues that releasing the material is justified due to significant public interest, though it will likely take weeks or months for any documents to be released. The final decision rests with the presiding judges, and any released information would be redacted to protect victims.</p>

          <p>A political commentary argues that members of the U.S. Congress, particularly Republicans, are increasingly voting for legislation they privately oppose, effectively surrendering their power to the executive branch. The article cites examples like Senator Josh Hawley voting for Medicaid cuts he publicly criticized and Senator Lisa Murkowski voting for a bill while hoping the House would change it. This trend of a "Vote Yes/Hope No Caucus" is seen as a form of political cowardice, where legislators avoid taking tough stands to prevent backlash.

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans support the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Approximately two-thirds of the public favor these space exploration goals, with particularly strong support coming from younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that most people believe the 1969 Apollo 11 mission was a worthwhile endeavor. These views are broadly shared across different political and ideological lines, indicating a general consensus on the value of space exploration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock of online real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed 189% this week after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson publicly announced his firm had taken a new position. Jackson, who gained credibility from an early, successful call on Carvana's recovery, posted on social media that he believes Opendoor could be a "100-bagger" in the coming years. This endorsement triggered a massive rally in the struggling company's stock, which had been at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq. The company's fundamentals have not changed, highlighting the significant influence of social media sentiment on volatile stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump establishes a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many visitors coming to the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, such as students and temporary skilled workers. This fee is part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and is effective for the current fiscal year. While the law suggests the fee could be reimbursed if visa holders comply with all regulations, such as leaving the country on time, the mechanism for collection and reimbursement has not yet been established. Immigration advocates argue this adds another financial hurdle for legal immigration pathways.</p>

          <p>The Druze are a religious community, with origins dating back about 1,000 years as an offshoot of Ismaili Shiite Islam, that is currently involved in violence in Syria. Most of their religious practices are kept secret, conversion is not permitted, and intermarriage with outsiders is strongly discouraged. A core tenet of their social doctrine is mutual defense, creating a tight-knit community where members support each other worldwide. The global Druze population is roughly one million, with the majority living in Syria, and significant communities also residing in Lebanon and Israel.</p>

          <p>A jury has ordered the city of Los Angeles to pay $48.8 million to Kamran Hakimi, a man who has been in a coma since being hit by a city sanitation truck in 2-24.

The city admitted the driver was at fault but disputed the amount of damages, arguing Hakimi's comatose state minimized his pain and suffering.

          <p>CBS has canceled its flagship late-night program, "The Late Show," with the franchise set to retire when host Stephen Colbert's contract ends in 2026. While the network cited purely financial reasons, the decision follows Colbert's recent on-air criticism of parent company Paramount's legal settlement with Donald Trump, fueling speculation of political motives. This analysis suggests the cancellation reflects the declining value and cultural power of traditional late-night talk shows in the streaming era. Even with high ratings, the format struggles with high production costs and an inability to command the broad audience it once did.</p>
