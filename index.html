The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and de-escalate trade tensions between the two nations, which had previously accused each other of violating trade agreements. U.S. representatives will brief President Trump, while China's representatives will brief President Xi, to secure their approval for the framework. While this signals a commitment to continued dialogue, the uncertainty remains regarding whether it will lead to substantial breakthroughs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that AI models struggle to represent concepts that require human senses, resulting in AI-generated content that lacks depth. Researchers found that Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot represent a flower in the same way humans do because they lack sensory and motor experiences. AI's inability to represent sensory concepts may explain why its creativity is often perceived as shallow. While AI can produce outputs that meet minimal definitions of creativity, it fails to capture the richness and complexity of human sensory experiences.</p>

          <p>President Trump's political operation has approached Texas Republicans about redrawing the congressional map to safeguard the GOP's House majority. Discussions are preliminary, but the potential redistricting could target as many as five Democratic seats. However, some Republicans worry that such a move could backfire, leading to legal challenges or Democratic gains in a wave election. The current map, approved in 2021, already favors Republicans, who hold a 25-12 majority of the state's seats.</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles experienced a calmer night under curfew, with fewer clashes between protesters and authorities, though dozens were arrested for violating the curfew. The curfew encompasses the civic center, including City Hall and federal buildings targeted by previous protests. Mayor Karen Bass expects the curfew to remain in place for several days to curb actions by those who do not support the immigrant community. Tensions had escalated over the weekend, leading to larger gatherings and episodes of violence, theft, and property destruction.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the U.S. rose 2.4 percent in May compared to the previous year, reflecting only the initial impact of President Trump's tariffs. This suggests that inflationary pressures remain subdued, despite concerns over potential price increases due to trade policies. The limited effects from tariffs indicate that businesses may be absorbing costs or adjusting prices cautiously in response to uncertain demand. Further monitoring will be necessary to assess the longer-term impact of trade measures on inflation.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has joined President Trump in criticizing the Federal Reserve, accusing it of "monetary malpractice" for not cutting interest rates. Vance's comments followed a report showing that tariffs have not exerted significant upward pressure on inflation. He argued that the Fed's refusal to lower rates is unwarranted given the easing inflation data and moderating labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to release its interest rate decision in a week, with markets anticipating a rate cut in September.</p>
