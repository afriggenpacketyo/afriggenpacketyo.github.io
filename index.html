          <p>A 113-year-old landmark church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being transported 5 kilometers to a new location to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The entire 672-tonne timber structure was hoisted onto rolling platforms for the two-day journey, a complex engineering feat that represents a symbolic moment in the broader relocation of the city's center. The mining company, LKAB, is financing the move, which involves preserving the church's valuable interior, including an altar painting and a 1,000-pipe organ, during the delicate transit process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a proposal to take a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, a move that would make the U.S. government its largest shareholder. The plan involves potentially converting some of the $10.9 billion in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company equity. This consideration is part of a broader effort to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and bolster a struggling Intel against global competitors, though it remains uncertain if the plan will proceed. The news follows a recent $2 billion investment in Intel by SoftBank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House has been acquired for $2.7 billion (£2 billion) by a consortium led by US hotel group MCR Hotels and private equity firm Apollo, a deal which will return the company to private ownership. As part of the acquisition, actor and investor Ashton Kutcher will join the company's board. The deal comes after Soho House struggled to achieve profitability and saw its share value decline since its 2021 IPO, amid concerns that its rapid expansion had diluted its exclusive brand. The new ownership aims to place the hospitality group on more stable footing for long-term growth.</p>

The aircraft, which merges the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane, is shown hovering in helicopter mode. If confirmed as a manned flight, it would be China's first such aircraft, drawing comparisons to the U.S. V-22 Osprey. While this technology offers significant versatility, it is also known for its mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety concerns, which present ongoing challenges for its development and deployment.</p>

          <p>An academic in Gaza provides a harrowing first-person account of the daily struggle to maintain intellectual work while facing deliberate starvation and the physical toll of famine. The article details how a full blockade has emptied markets and shuttered bakeries, forcing residents to survive on minimal, overpriced aid as malnutrition-related deaths rise. The author describes the immense difficulty of concentrating, teaching, and writing while battling extreme hunger, dehydration, and the collapse of basic infrastructure, framing the continuation of academic work as an act of resistance against erasure.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japanese investment firm SoftBank Group fell by over 5% after it announced a $2 billion investment in U.S. chipmaker Intel. The deal involves SoftBank purchasing Intel's common stock at $23 per share, a price below the stock's previous closing value. This market reaction occurred as broader Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, with investors awaiting a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and assessing the diplomatic talks between the U.S., Ukraine, and European leaders. The drop in SoftBank's stock snapped a nine-day winning streak for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts and students suggest practical strategies for parents and carers, such as planning for various outcomes, avoiding vague reassurances, and considering alternative ways to receive results to avoid overwhelming environments.

The summit focused on securing U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with NATO's chief describing progress on this front as a "breakthrough." However, Trump maintained his position that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for talks with Russia, a stance that diverges from the European consensus. The meeting highlighted Europe's alarm over Trump's recent pro-Russian rhetoric and aimed to present a united front to safeguard Ukraine's interests.</p>

Supporters believe it will effectively promote the sport, while critics, including doubles specialist Jamie Murray, argue it devalues a Grand Slam title and becomes a "glorified exhibition."

In some cases, photos of modern-day descendants were also used to inform the AI-generated profiles.

Although her attacker was convicted and jailed in the UK, her application was rejected because the crime occurred on a Qatari-registered aircraft, which is not considered a "relevant place" under the scheme's current rules. Her lawyers argue this is an irrational gap in the law, as UK criminal courts have jurisdiction over such offenses on foreign planes bound for the UK.

This trend has seen over 36 major clubs receive private equity participation, with many investors adopting a multi-club ownership model to maximize returns.

Key moments, such as Trump's sudden reversal on the necessity of a ceasefire and his interruption of the meeting with European leaders to call Putin, indicate that his strategy is now closely aligned with Moscow's. This dynamic suggests that any forthcoming peace proposal is likely to be shaped by Russian interests, which prioritize a settlement before a ceasefire to maintain leverage.

In contrast, Chinese beekeeping often involves more direct and adaptive management, which has contributed to the population's resilience and growth, offering potential lessons for other nations facing bee population decline.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: EU's Inaction on Gaza Crisis Reflects Systemic Racism and Colonial Mentality</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union's failure to take meaningful action against Israel's devastation of Gaza is rooted in systemic racism and a lingering colonial mindset. The author contends that the EU's paralysis, despite having powerful diplomatic and economic levers at its disposal, stems from the dehumanization of Palestinians, which mirrors the treatment of racialized Europeans and refugees. The piece contrasts the EU's strong response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its inaction on Gaza, calling this disparity a visible double standard. It calls for a moral reckoning that confronts these biases to restore the EU's credibility.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson, effectively blocking them from playing this season. Both players had sued the NCAA, arguing that its five-year eligibility rule violated antitrust laws by unfairly limiting their NIL earning potential. However, the judge ruled that the NCAA's rule was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny. The decision deals a significant blow to both teams, who had been counting on the two transfers to play key roles this fall.</p>

          <p>Florida is scheduled to execute Kayle Bates, 67, for the 1982 abduction and murder of Janet White in Bay County. This will be the state's 10th execution in 2025, a record number for a single year in Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Bates was convicted of kidnapping White from her office, attempting to sexually assault her, and stabbing her to death. His final appeals to the state and federal supreme courts are pending, with his attorneys arguing that evidence of brain damage was inadequately considered and that the governor's process for signing death warrants is discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Following the Los Angeles Dodgers' 4-3 walk-off loss to the Colorado Rockies, shortstop Mookie Betts met with manager Dave Roberts and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. The loss was punctuated by two costly defensive plays from right fielder Teoscar Hernández, prompting speculation about a potential defensive realignment. Roberts publicly stated that Hernández needs to improve his defense, raising the possibility of moving Betts, a six-time Gold Glove winner in right field, back to his former position. The meeting and the on-field struggles highlight growing concerns about the team's defensive stability as they head into a crucial part of the season.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House appeared more cordial than their previous encounter, though significant policy differences remain. Zelenskyy, who wore a suit and expressed gratitude, sought to align the U.S. with the European position on ending the war, particularly regarding the need for a ceasefire, which Trump has dismissed as unnecessary. While discussions focused on potential security guarantees and a future meeting with Vladimir Putin, no firm agreements were announced. The primary outcome for Ukraine seems to be buying more time and avoiding a catastrophic breakdown in relations, maintaining the current diplomatic status quo.</p>

The judge ruled that the claim regarding a lack of clarity over which immigration court had jurisdiction is now moot, as the government has since designated a court. However, claims that the government is violating detainees' First Amendment rights by impeding confidential access to lawyers remain a "live controversy." The case concerning legal access has been transferred to a different federal court, while a separate lawsuit challenges the facility on environmental grounds.</p>

          <p>Seattle's Police Chief, Shon Barnes, was reportedly having lunch just yards away from a jewelry store as four masked robbers carried out a brazen daylight heist, stealing an estimated $2 million in merchandise. The suspects smashed the front door of Menashe & Sons Jewelers, threatened staff, and emptied six display cases in approximately 90 seconds before escaping. A police department spokesperson confirmed the chief and his plainclothes security detail were inside a nearby business and were unaware of the robbery until responding units with sirens arrived.

During a meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Trump reiterated his unsubstantiated claims that mail-in ballots are inherently corrupt and susceptible to widespread fraud. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections, a power that can only be altered by Congress. Election experts have dismissed the claims of widespread fraud and noted that banning the practice would be an unconstitutional overreach of executive power.</p>

The documents detail multiple complaints about his condescending and unsettling interactions with women, which led to disciplinary meetings and mandatory training.

Both developments are seen as part of a broader U.S. effort to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing and support Intel as it competes with global rivals like Samsung and TSMC.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India, the world's second-largest supplier of seafarers, paradoxically has the highest number of sailors abandoned on vessels by shipowners. In 2024, nearly 900 of the 3,133 known abandoned sailors globally were Indian nationals. This crisis occurs when shipowners sever ties, failing to pay wages or provide for repatriation, often leaving crews stranded for months in precarious situations, including war zones. The issue is largely attributed to the practice of using "flags of convenience," where ships are registered in countries with weak regulations, obscuring ownership and allowing unscrupulous operators to evade responsibility.</p>
