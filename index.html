          <p>Residents in a Wisconsin city are expressing strong opposition to a proposed $1.6 billion data center planned for local farmland. The mystery company behind the project has drawn significant local ire, with community members raising concerns about the potential impact on the area's natural beauty and resources. This backlash is part of a broader trend of local resistance to large-scale tech infrastructure projects across the country. The newsletter from which this story is drawn also covers other developments in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Contrary to claims from some health policy advocates, the current generation of Americans is not the "sickest in history." This article presents evidence showing dramatic long-term improvements in public health, including a near doubling of life expectancy since the late 19th century due to vaccines, cleaner environments, and safer workplaces. While acknowledging modern health challenges like obesity and mental illness, the analysis argues that historical context reveals a much healthier present compared to a past where infectious diseases were rampant and child mortality was staggeringly high.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management is pressuring Performance Food Group to explore a merger with its competitor, US Foods. Sachem Head has nominated four new candidates to the company's board, arguing that a combination could unlock between $800 million and $1 billion in annual synergies, based on a previous attempt by Sysco to acquire US Foods. The firm suggests that such a deal would create significant value for shareholders and that the current regulatory environment under the Trump administration might be more favorable to approval than in the past.

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group have surged nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its purchase of over 5 million shares, but it remains unclear if the investment is profitable for Warren Buffett's firm. The stock was purchased during the second quarter when prices fluctuated significantly, meaning Berkshire's position could be either in the red or showing a substantial gain depending on the exact timing. Despite the stock's recent rally, it is still down for the year, though some analysts are raising their price targets, citing conviction in the company's turnaround plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An airstrike, reportedly carried out by Myanmar's military junta, has killed at least 19 students and wounded many more at two private schools in Rakhine state. The attack occurred in a village within a township controlled by the Arakan Army, an ethnic armed group fighting the military government. This incident is part of the escalating conflict in the region and across Myanmar since the 2021 military coup. The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, condemned the "brutal attack," highlighting the devastating impact of the violence on children and civilian communities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy is exhibiting signs of stagflation, a rare combination of stagnant growth and rising inflation, with some economists blaming recent Trump administration policies. A slowdown in hiring, coupled with an increase in the inflation rate to 2.9%, has shifted economic forecasts away from previous optimism. Experts cite the administration's crackdown on immigration, which has tightened the labor supply, and tariffs, which are now being passed on to consumers as higher prices, as key drivers. This situation complicates the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy, as its traditional tools are less effective against stagflation.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural and social legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete apartment blocks that defined much of East German architecture. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages, these buildings housed a quarter of the GDR's population and created a shared collective memory. After German reunification, however, they became symbols of economic decline and social problems, including a rise in extremist violence. The exhibition aims to present a nuanced view of these structures as both architectural heritage and sites of painful historical transformation.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," profiles 12 influential Chinese individuals whose experiences in the U.S. helped shape modern China and fostered an era of cooperation between the two nations. The book highlights figures like scientist Xie Xide and diplomat Ji Chaozhu, reminding readers of a time when engagement was viewed with optimism, a stark contrast to today's climate of intense competition and distrust. The editors argue that these stories demonstrate the benefits of finding common ground and express concern that both countries are losing sight of their shared interests.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, some historians of the American Civil War are noting parallels between the current political moment and the dangerously polarized 1850s. Scholars point to similarities such as widespread disillusionment with the Supreme Court, spasms of political violence, and the rise of paramilitary-style political movements. While cautioning that the country is not as fractured as it was before the Civil War, they highlight how the perception of unstoppable, sectional violence contributed to the nation's spiral into conflict. The reaction to violence is seen as just as concerning as the violence itself.</p>

          <p>An opinion column reflects on Vice President Kamala Harris's new memoir, arguing that President Biden's 2023 decision to run for a second term created a difficult situation for her and other potential successors. The author posits that Biden, who in 2020 cast himself as a "bridge" to a new generation of leaders, ultimately became a roadblock by delaying the party's transition. Harris's book, titled "107 Days," refers to the short window she had to campaign after Biden eventually stepped aside. The article suggests that critiques of Harris's 2024 campaign should consider the challenging timeline she was given.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has unleashed a wave of extremely divisive and hateful reactions on social media, prompting Utah's governor to decry the platforms as "a cancer on our society." In the days following the shooting, some right-wing accounts called for violence while others celebrated Kirk's death, and misinformation spread rapidly about innocent individuals. The vitriol has led to widespread calls for people to log off, reject online fury, and avoid the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that experts warn is being amplified by both domestic extremists and foreign bots seeking to sow discord.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica is on the brink of a financial crisis, prompting the City Council to declare a state of fiscal distress. While a post-pandemic economic downturn has hurt revenues, the city's finances have been crippled by hundreds of millions of dollars in legal settlements related to a former police dispatcher who sexually abused children for decades. Santa Monica has already paid out $229 million and still faces 180 additional claims. The declaration is intended to help the city seek grants and realign operations, but has raised concerns about potential service cuts and layoffs among city employees.</p>

The attacks are being carried out with broadhead arrows, a type used for hunting.

          <p>The city of Orem, Utah, a deeply religious and conservative community, is struggling to comprehend how it became the site of Charlie Kirk's assassination. Known as "Family City USA," the area is characterized by its strong community values and high concentration of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Residents gathered for a vigil, expressing disbelief that such a violent political act could occur in their town, a place where Kirk's views were largely shared. The event has forced a painful reckoning with the intrusion of national political violence into their tight-knit community.</p>
