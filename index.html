          <p>A beachgoer in Walton County, Florida, discovered nearly $500,000 worth of cocaine that had washed ashore. The 25 kilos of narcotics were found wrapped in distinctive packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The Walton County Sheriff's Office confiscated the drugs and warned the public not to touch any suspicious packages found on the beach, as their contents could be harmful. This incident is the latest in a series of discoveries where large quantities of illicit drugs, often in uniquely branded packages, have washed up along Florida's coastline, particularly after major storms or hurricanes.</p>

          <p>British number one Jack Draper secured his place in the second round of Wimbledon with a commanding performance against Sebastian Baez, who was forced to retire due to injury. Draper was leading 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when Baez, a clay-court specialist, could not continue after slipping on the baseline. As the host nation's biggest hope following Andy Murray's retirement, the 23-year-old Draper confidently handled the expectations on Court One. He will next face 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic in what is expected to be a more significant challenge on the grass court.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare announced it will begin blocking artificial intelligence crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move that could significantly impact how AI models are trained. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly opt-in to allow AI bots to access their content, giving creators more control over their intellectual property. Cloudflare, which handles roughly 16% of global internet traffic, argues that AI scraping deprives publishers of traffic and ad revenue. This change puts pressure on AI developers like OpenAI and Google, who rely on vast amounts of web data to build their large language models.</p>

          <p>A public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk has intensified over the administration's massive spending bill, which passed the Senate on Tuesday. Musk, a former White House aide, strongly opposes the bill due to its projected $4 trillion increase to the national debt, threatening to fund primary challenges against its supporters. In response, President Trump warned he might direct the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a program Musk once ran, to review federal contracts with Musk's companies like SpaceX and Tesla. The conflict highlights a dramatic falling out between the two influential figures over fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>A column in The Atlantic argues that the Republican tax and spending bill is a reckless piece of legislation that will impose massive harm on millions of Americans for the benefit of the wealthy. The author contends that the bill's combination of deficit-exploding tax cuts and severe reductions to programs like Medicaid and food assistance is not only morally questionable but also politically self-destructive. The piece suggests Republicans are either unaware of the bill's deep unpopularity, genuinely believe in its harsh ideology, or are simply succumbing to presidential pressure. The author concludes the party is ignoring catastrophic risks to both the economy and their political future.</p>

Collins cited concerns over drastic Medicaid cuts that would impact nearly a third of her state's population and harm rural hospitals. Tillis also opposed the Medicaid provisions, while Paul, a fiscal conservative, stated his opposition was due to the bill's failure to enact significant fiscal reform and its contribution to out-of-control national debt.

          <p>Athleisure brand Lululemon is suing wholesale giant Costco, accusing it of patent infringement by selling knockoff versions of its popular apparel designs under the Kirkland Signature brand. The lawsuit claims Costco is illegally profiting from Lululemon's reputation and innovation by creating and selling "dupes" that improperly associate with the authentic, higher-priced products. Lululemon, a dominant force in the luxury athletic space with over $10 billion in annual revenue, stated it takes the protection of its intellectual property very seriously. The case highlights the growing trend of social media-fueled demand for lower-priced alternatives to popular name-brand goods.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led "big beautiful" bill, passed by the Senate, includes a new temporary tax deduction aimed at providing relief for seniors, framed as a "senior bonus." The proposal would offer a deduction of up to $6,000 for eligible taxpayers aged 65 and over, phasing out for those with higher incomes. This measure is an alternative to President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, which could not be achieved through the budget reconciliation process. Critics note that while the bonus targets lower-to-middle-income seniors, the overall bill could accelerate the insolvency dates for Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

However, because the credit is only partially refundable, the lowest-earning families who do not owe federal income tax cannot access the full amount. The House version of the bill proposed a higher credit of $2,500, but only through 2028, setting up a point of negotiation between the two chambers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis has identified the best job markets in the United States, with Bend, Oregon, claiming the top spot. The ranking, which considered factors like unemployment, income growth, and work-life balance, highlighted Bend for its low 3.1% unemployment rate and impressive 44% median income growth from 2020 to 2023. The city also scored well for its short commute times and high percentage of remote workers. Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington, ranked second and third, respectively. The report underscores how location can be a critical factor for job seekers looking for both professional opportunity and a high quality of life.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the U.S. will cut over a billion dollars in promised funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which vaccinates children in low-income countries. Kennedy justified the decision by citing a single 2017 study that claimed the DTP vaccine was associated with higher mortality rates in Guinea-Bissau. However, global health experts interviewed by NPR have heavily criticized the study, pointing to its use of outdated 1980s data, methodological flaws, and the fact that its own authors later published conflicting findings. The move has stunned the global health community, with experts warning it will likely lead to preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plan for mass layoffs and a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 attorneys general, who argued the plan would have devastating consequences on public health services. The judge found there was "no rational basis" for the overhaul, which would have impacted crucial agencies like the CDC and FDA. The court determined the plan would cause irreparable harm and that the executive branch likely exceeded its authority in attempting such wholesale changes without congressional action.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, a pioneering televangelist whose global ministry crumbled after a 1980s sex scandal, has died at the age of 90. Swaggart built a media empire from his base in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reaching millions with his passionate Pentecostal sermons. His career was permanently damaged in 1988 after he was photographed with a sex worker, leading to a tearful, televised confession where he admitted to sinning against his followers. Despite being defrocked, he continued to preach, though his influence was greatly diminished. He was also known for his gospel music and controversial statements about other faiths.</p>

The bill is partially funded by cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating it will add over $3 trillion to the deficit over ten years. The nearly 900-page bill now returns to the House for approval before it can be sent to the President's desk.</p>

The demonstrations were organized in opposition to controversial constitutional reforms that position long-time leader Faure Gnassingbe to remain in power indefinitely. Activist groups accuse security forces and militia of using excessive force, including tear gas and batons, against protesters. While the government acknowledged that bodies were recovered from a lagoon, it claimed the deaths were due to drowning.

This labor shortage threatens the state's multi-billion dollar fruit and vegetable industry, which relies heavily on undocumented workers.
