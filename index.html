          <p>A passenger train derailed in Russia's Bryansk region, near the Ukrainian border, after a bridge collapsed, resulting in seven deaths. Local officials attributed the collapse to "illegal interference," prompting an investigation into the incident. The train, en route from Klimov to Moscow, came off its tracks, leading to emergency response efforts at the scene. The disaster area is approximately 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, an area that has experienced border shelling and drone strikes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
