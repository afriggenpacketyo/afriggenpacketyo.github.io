        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of emergency alerts reveals that the National Weather Service issued 22 warnings for the Kerr County area as catastrophic flooding unfolded, with messages escalating in urgency over several hours. The first alert for Kerr County arrived at 1:14 a.m. on July 4, but the most critical warning to "SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!" was not sent until 4:03 a.m. Local county governments did not issue their own alerts, relying solely on the NWS system. This timeline raises questions about the effectiveness and public reception of the warnings, as many residents reported not receiving them or underestimating their severity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly Texas floods are prompting questions about the adequacy of emergency warnings and the impact of potential staffing and budget cuts at the National Weather Service. Local officials claimed the rainfall exceeded forecasts, while the NWS and meteorology experts defend the accuracy and escalating urgency of their alerts. The investigation highlights that Kerr County lacked a local warning system and that potential staff shortages, including a vacant warning coordination meteorologist position, may have hindered communication. The tragedy has initiated a debate over funding for meteorological services and emergency preparedness infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 95 fatalities, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River rise with shocking speed, heavily impacted Kerr County, where a summer camp for girls suffered at least 27 deaths among its campers and counselors. President Trump has approved a major disaster declaration, enabling federal resources for the ongoing, large-scale search and rescue operations involving state and federal personnel. Officials have described the scene as horrific and are continuing round-the-clock efforts to locate all missing individuals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose significant new tariffs on at least seven countries, set to take effect on August 1. In letters shared on social media, President Trump detailed levies of 25% on goods from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan, 30% on South Africa, and 40% on Laos and Myanmar. The move is part of the administration's "reciprocal tariff" policy, aimed at correcting what it views as unfair trade deficits. The announcement, which extends a previous deadline, caused a downturn in U.S. financial markets amid concerns over escalating trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

The film's success was significantly boosted by a partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total gross. While the high-budget film still has a way to go to reach profitability, its box office performance is a major milestone for Apple's growing entertainment division.</p>

          <p>Actor and former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recently visited Mount Vernon to speak at a naturalization ceremony for 100 new American citizens. The article reflects on his admiration for George Washington, focusing on the first president's decision to relinquish power rather than seek continued rule. Schwarzenegger, like historical figures before him, sees Washington's greatness in this voluntary restraint, contrasting the pursuit of power with the ideal of civic stewardship. The event highlights how Washington's legacy continues to inspire, particularly for immigrants who have embraced the American experiment and its unique founding principles.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded its highest annual number of measles cases since 1992, with the tally surpassing 1,270 and driven largely by an ongoing outbreak in Texas. Public health experts warn that the official count likely underestimates the true scope of the problem and attribute the resurgence to falling childhood vaccination rates. The decline in immunizations has been linked to disruptions from the pandemic and the growing influence of the anti-vaccine movement. This represents a significant setback for a disease that was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, raising alarms about the return of preventable illnesses.</p>

Daines clarified that such a change must come from within Iran, not through U.S. intervention, to ensure its legitimacy.

The review also reaffirmed the official conclusion that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell in 2019, citing video evidence showing no one entered his cell area.

          <p>The political alliance between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump appears to have collapsed, with Musk spending a holiday weekend criticizing a major spending bill signed by Trump. Musk questioned the purpose of his previous government efficiency work if the national debt was just going to increase, prompting a sharp rebuke from the president. Trump accused Musk of going "off the rails" and suggested his frustration stemmed from the elimination of EV tax breaks. The public spat marks a significant downturn in their relationship and could have political implications, as Musk has floated the idea of launching a third party.</p>

          <p>The United States is set to remove Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group that now leads Syria's interim government, from its list of foreign terrorist organizations. The move follows the ousting of the Assad regime and is part of a broader Western effort to reset relations with the new Syrian leadership. HTS, formerly an al-Qaeda affiliate, is led by interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who severed ties with the terrorist network in 2016. This diplomatic shift comes as the U.S. and UK lift sanctions to support Syria's recovery, although concerns remain about the new government's operations and treatment of minorities.</p>

          <p>El Gato Night Market, a popular destination for Latino street food in Los Angeles, is slowly recovering after a two-week shutdown prompted by fears of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. The market, which provides a vital source of income for dozens of immigrant vendors, has seen a significant drop in both vendors and customers since reopening. Organizers and vendors describe a community built on family and diverse cuisines, now struggling with the choice between their safety and their livelihood. Despite the fear, they are showing up to provide comfort and familiarity, hoping customers will return to support their businesses.</p>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced temporary checks at its border with Germany, a move analysts fear could signal the erosion of the European Union's Schengen border-free travel zone. The Polish government cited the need to curb irregular migration, a justification that mirrors Germany's own recent tightening of border controls. This tit-for-tat measure is part of a broader European trend, with countries like France and Austria also maintaining long-term checks, undermining a cornerstone of EU integration. Experts warn that while these controls are often symbolic, they impose real economic costs and risk unraveling one of the EU's most tangible achievements.</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times story about Zohran Mamdani's college application has drawn sharp criticism, with some accusing the newspaper of attempting to undermine his mayoral campaign. The article, which focused on how Mamdani identified his race as a high school senior, was based on hacked data from a controversial source and has been labeled a "made-up scandal" by media critics. This incident, combined with a pre-primary editorial from the Times urging voters not to rank Mamdani, has raised questions about the paper's neutrality. Proponents of Mamdani argue the coverage is part of a larger pattern of opposition to his progressive candidacy.</p>

In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Pezeshkian alleged that Israel bombed a location in Tehran where he was holding a meeting, but he was not harmed. The Iranian president also expressed skepticism about future negotiations with the U.S., questioning how his country could trust a process that could be undermined by an Israeli attack.

          <p>With the UK facing another heatwave, farmers are warning that the risk of devastating wildfires is dangerously high, describing the landscape as a "tinder box." Some farmers attribute the increased risk to land management policies that incentivize the removal of grazing animals like sheep, leading to a build-up of dry vegetation that acts as fuel. The cost of farm fires has already risen dramatically, and there are calls for the government and fire services to work with farmers on better prevention strategies. The Met Office has issued red alerts for "very high" UV levels as temperatures are expected to climb into the low 30s Celsius.</p>

The research, which analyzed survey data from over 700,000 students, revealed that general handgun carrying rose by 65% between 2002 and 2022, with notable increases among female and middle school-aged teens. In contrast, the study found that carrying a handgun to school decreased by 60% during the same period. The findings highlight a worrying trend in youth gun possession, even as firearms have become the leading cause of death for children and teens in the U.S.</p>
