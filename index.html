          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years.

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the proposal as "free movement through the back door," while Reform UK echoed similar concerns.

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly rebuked Walmart after the retailer cautioned that tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump suggested that Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" rather than pass the costs on to customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had previously stated that the company would absorb some of the tariff-related costs and work with suppliers to minimize price increases. Several other companies, including Microsoft, Mattel, and Ford, have also announced or warned of price increases due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>Erling Haaland's struggles at Wembley Stadium persisted as he failed to score during Manchester City's FA Cup final loss against Crystal Palace. The Norwegian striker surprised many by passing up the opportunity to take a penalty, handing the ball to Omar Marmoush, who subsequently missed the spot-kick. Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested that the occasion may have gotten to Haaland, highlighting the difference between him and Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. City manager Pep Guardiola said that the decision was ultimately down to the players' feeling in that moment.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Russia for sending a "sham" delegation to peace talks in Istanbul, stating that real progress requires direct engagement with President Vladimir Putin. The talks, initiated by Putin, involved lower-level officials and resulted in a prisoner swap agreement but no ceasefire. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about the Russian delegation's authority to make decisions, while Ukrainian officials accused Russia of making unacceptable demands. Experts suggest that Russia's participation was primarily for propaganda purposes, with any genuine rapprochement unlikely until the fall.</p>

Third base coach Tony Mansolino will serve as interim manager, with the organization hoping for a turnaround in the team's performance.</p>

The Supreme Court rebuked the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation.

Despite these legal challenges, the Trump administration has openly questioned the need for due process in immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a high-stakes presidential election, with hard-right candidate George Simion facing pro-EU liberal Nicusor Dan in the runoff. A Simion victory could trigger a crisis in the European Union, given his "sovereignist" views and past pro-Russian stances. The election is marked by deep societal divisions and is considered a historic decision for Romania. Simion's recent campaign rhetoric has softened, but concerns remain about his anti-Ukrainian stance and lack of experience in governance.</p>
