          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick Airport, resulting in at least 241 fatalities with only one survivor. The aircraft, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed into a residential area, causing additional casualties on the ground including medical students. Initial flight data indicates the plane struggled to gain altitude before descending rapidly and crashing. Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the crash, with assistance from U.S. and U.K. agencies, and support is being provided to the families of the victims. The sole survivor, a British national of Indian origin, is being treated in a local hospital after being pulled from the wreckage.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement agencies are reporting a rise in the use of hidden cameras placed in residential gardens and lawns, which are believed to be used by burglary suspects to monitor homes. The cameras, sometimes disguised as ordinary objects, allow criminals to determine when a house is unoccupied. Cases have been reported across the country, from California to Massachusetts, prompting officials to urge residents to be vigilant and report any suspicious devices. South American Theft Groups, often composed of Chilean or Colombian nationals, are known to use this tactic as part of their organized criminal activities.</p>

          <p>A federal court in San Francisco is hearing arguments in a case brought by California against the Trump administration regarding the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles. The state contends that Trump exceeded his authority by federalizing the Guard without Governor Newsom's consent and deploying Marines on American soil. The Trump administration argues that the courts should not interfere with the president's authority to deploy the military, citing historical precedents. Protests in Los Angeles, triggered by immigration enforcement actions, led to the deployments, sparking a legal and political battle over federal and state powers.</p>

They emphasized the importance of coordination between governors and the federal government, particularly when dealing with the National Guard, and criticized the move as an overreach of federal authority.

          <p>AMD announced new details about its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, set to ship next year, at an event featuring OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The MI400 chips can be assembled into a server rack called Helios, allowing thousands of chips to function as a unified "rack-scale" system. Altman expressed enthusiasm for the chips' specifications, and AMD aims to compete with Nvidia on price and performance. The company plans to undercut Nvidia with aggressive pricing and lower operating costs, targeting the growing market for AI chips expected to exceed $500 billion by 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

The Titan’s carbon fiber hull and cylindrical shape deviated from industry standards, and the sub had documented hull damage.
