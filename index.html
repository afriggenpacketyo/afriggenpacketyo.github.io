          <p>The Nobel Prize in physics has been awarded to three U.S.-based scientists, John Clarke, Michel Devoret, and John Martinis, for their groundbreaking work in quantum mechanics tunneling. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the prize as part of Nobel Prize Week, which also saw awards given for medicine. The prizes, which include a cash award of nearly $1.2 million to be shared among the winners, will be formally presented at a ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. The remaining prizes for chemistry, literature, and peace will be announced later in the week.</p>

          <p>On the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, German political leaders have expressed deep concern over a new wave of antisemitism within the country. Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for Germans to show solidarity with Jewish communities, highlighting that hate is spreading on social media, at universities, and on the streets. Commemorative events were held across Germany, including at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, to honor the victims. The anniversary serves as a stark reminder of the attack's enduring impact and the subsequent war in Gaza, which continues to fuel tensions globally.</p>

          <p>The Australian Open has announced a new pre-tournament event called the 'Million Dollar One Point Slam,' where amateur players will compete against top professionals in a single-point showdown. World number one Carlos Alcaraz is set to headline the event, which will feature a winner-take-all prize of one million Australian dollars. In each match, players will decide the server with 'rock, paper, scissors,' and the winner of a single point advances. This innovative format aims to create a unique and high-stakes spectacle, building on a smaller-scale version of the event held in the previous year.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 175% after the White House announced it would acquire a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a federal push to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper and cobalt from Alaska's Ambler mining district. The decision reverses the previous administration's rejection of the controversial Ambler Road project, a move praised by the company for securing domestic supply chains but strongly opposed by critics due to its potential environmental impact on the Alaskan wilderness.

          <p>Two years after the October 7 attack, the war between Israel and Hamas has resulted in unprecedented destruction in Gaza and a staggering death toll of over 67,000 Palestinians. Israel has expanded its military operations into neighboring countries while facing international accusations of genocide, which it denies. The conflict has also seen increased involvement from the U.S. under President Trump, who has pushed for a resolution while assisting Israeli military actions. A new 20-point peace plan, which involves a transfer of power in Gaza, has received a cautiously positive response from Hamas, with further talks scheduled in Egypt.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops from Texas have been deployed to Chicago after a federal judge denied Illinois's request for an immediate block on the move. The state of Illinois, led by Governor JB Pritzker, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing the deployment infringes on state sovereignty and will cause further unrest. This action is part of a broader, contentious effort by the administration to send federal and state troops to Democratic-led cities to address protests and immigration enforcement. A similar deployment was successfully blocked by a judge in Oregon, highlighting the ongoing legal battles over presidential authority.</p>

These subsidies, which have significantly lowered insurance premiums for millions, are set to expire, and their renewal is a key Democratic demand for reopening the government. With open enrollment for 2026 health plans approaching, Democrats aim to highlight the potential for dramatic premium increases, particularly in states that supported Donald Trump, framing the standoff as a critical fight for affordable healthcare for working-class Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's push to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led cities without state approval is testing the legal limits of presidential power. The administration is using a rarely invoked statute, Title 10, to federalize troops for domestic missions, citing an inability to enforce federal immigration laws due to local protests. This move has sparked lawsuits from states like Illinois and Oregon, which argue it violates their sovereignty. While courts have shown mixed responses, legal experts note this application of federal authority is unprecedented and raises significant questions about the balance of power between state and federal governments.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that China is decisively leading the global green energy revolution while the United States risks being left behind due to political uncertainty. The article highlights that China's solar installations in 2024 dwarfed those of the U.S., which now faces potential setbacks under the Trump administration. While the U.S. remains a top producer of fossil fuels, the author asserts it is shirking its climate responsibilities as a major per capita carbon emitter. The piece concludes that global renewable energy growth is rapidly accelerating, a trend driven largely by China's strategic investments and industrial scale.</p>

          <h2>Youth Voter Apathy Looms Over Cameroon's Upcoming Presidential Election</h2>

          <p>With 92-year-old President Paul Biya seeking an eighth term in Cameroon, many young people are expressing frustration and disillusionment with the political process. The disqualification of popular opposition candidate Maurice Kamto has led to widespread belief that the election is a foregone conclusion, fueling calls for a boycott. While over half the population is under 30, issues like unemployment, corruption, and a sense of political exclusion have left many youths feeling their votes are meaningless. Despite an increase in youth voter registration, significant apathy remains a major factor ahead of the October 12 election.</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7 attacks, peace talks in Egypt offer a significant opportunity to end the devastating war in Gaza, but success is far from certain. Both Israelis and Palestinians are weary of the conflict, which has killed over 66,000 Palestinians and left Gaza in a humanitarian catastrophe. The negotiations, based on a U.S. framework, are being driven by pressure from the Trump administration on both Israel and Hamas. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas's military wing face internal pressures from hardliners who wish to continue the war, making the path to a lasting ceasefire extremely challenging.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have dismantled an international criminal network suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. The investigation, triggered by a victim who tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse, led to 18 arrests and the recovery of over 2,000 devices. Police believe the gang may be responsible for exporting nearly half of all phones stolen in London, where phone theft has nearly tripled in four years. The operation highlights the lucrative nature of the stolen phone trade, with devices reportedly sold for thousands of pounds overseas.</p>

El-Anani's nomination comes as UNESCO faces significant budget challenges following the withdrawal of the United States, which cited an anti-Israel bias. He has pledged to prioritize addressing the agency's financial shortfall and has stated his goal is to persuade the U.S. to rejoin the organization.</p>

          <p>European stock markets showed a mixed and muted response after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on all medium- and heavy-duty trucks imported into the country, effective November 1. The move is the latest in an effort to shield American companies from foreign competition and comes just before a scheduled meeting with Canada's prime minister. Meanwhile, market data from the UK indicated that annual house price growth slowed to its weakest rate in nearly 18 months, adding to a cautious investor sentiment across the region.

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to leverage the natural cooling properties of the deep sea. The facility consists of large, 1,300-tonne cabins submerged 35 meters underwater, each capable of housing hundreds of servers. By using seawater for cooling, the data center significantly reduces the energy consumption and operational costs associated with traditional land-based facilities. This innovative project is a key part of Hainan's strategic plan to develop new technologies for the marine-based "blue economy."</p>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates a significant decline in mutual empathy between Israelis and Palestinians, raising concerns about the long-term prospects for reconciliation after the current war. One survey found that a large majority of Israeli Jews agreed with the statement, "There are no innocent people in Gaza." Conflict resolution experts on both sides describe an almost complete dehumanization, with each society increasingly unwilling to recognize the humanity of the other. This profound alienation presents a major obstacle to any future peace process, as it undermines the willingness to make necessary compromises for a lasting solution.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on students not to participate in pro-Palestinian protests scheduled for the second anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Citing concerns about "rising antisemitism," Starmer described protesting on the anniversary as disrespectful and warned that such events have been used as an excuse to attack British Jews. The call comes amid heightened security for Jewish communities following a recent deadly attack on a synagogue in Manchester. University leaders have also urged students to consider the timing and impact of the planned demonstrations.</p>

          <p>France's political turmoil has intensified following the resignation of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu after only 27 days in office, marking the third government collapse in a year. The crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc lacking a parliamentary majority, leading to a deadlock over the national budget and spending cuts. Macron has given Lecornu 48 hours to attempt final negotiations, but he now faces difficult choices: appoint another prime minister, possibly from an opposing party, or call for new parliamentary elections, which polls suggest could favor Marine Le Pen's far-right party.</p>

However, Plumptre defends her choice, stating that she feels safer as a woman in Jeddah than in the UK and wants to challenge Western preconceptions. She also acknowledges that the Saudi women's league still has a long way to go in its development.</p>
