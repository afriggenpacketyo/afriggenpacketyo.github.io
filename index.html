          <p>Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp reported that a knife was pulled on him during a visit to a migrant camp in northern France. He was there to investigate the illegal migration crisis, stating he was also pelted with bottles. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding small boat crossings of the English Channel, a number that has exceeded 27,000 this year. The Labour government is focusing on tackling smuggling gangs, while Conservatives criticize the scrapping of the Rwanda plan.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Germany have warned they are prepared to trigger the "snapback" mechanism to re-impose UN sanctions on Iran if it fails to resume nuclear talks by the end of August. The threat follows a period of diplomatic stalemate and a recent war between Iran and Israel that saw strikes on Iranian nuclear-related facilities. Iran has since suspended cooperation with the IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog. The European nations are urging Iran to return to diplomacy and full cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various NATO leaders before his in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. European leaders, concerned about being sidelined, are pushing for Ukraine's inclusion in any peace talks to avoid outcomes that favor Moscow. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any negotiations about Ukraine that happen without Ukrainian participation will not be effective. The discussions occur as Trump has suggested Ukraine may need to cede some territory for peace.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues against viewing China's advancements in green technology as a threatening "China Shock 2.0." Instead, it posits that China is acting as a builder of new global systems, particularly in the clean energy sector. The article highlights that in 2023, China installed more solar capacity than the rest of the world combined and is drastically driving down the cost of solar panels. This leadership is framed not as a destabilizing force but as a crucial contribution to underwriting the world's green transition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The inspiration for the world-famous Barbie doll was a German character named Lilli, who first appeared in a 1952 comic strip in the Bild tabloid. Originally designed to appeal to male readers, Lilli was a risqué, pin-up style character who was later turned into a doll sold in bars and tobacco shops as an adult novelty gift. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll in Switzerland in 1956, bought the rights, and redesigned it into Barbie, which launched in 1959 and became a global phenomenon.</p>

The Department of Justice has proposed that Google be forced to sell Chrome as a remedy in the antitrust case. Losing Chrome would be a significant blow to Google, as the browser is a key gateway for data collection that fuels its massive advertising business. The move highlights the intense battle for market position in the age of AI-driven search.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated there is currently "no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war" as the U.S. prepares for a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. The White House has framed the upcoming meeting in Alaska as a "listening exercise" for Trump to gauge Putin's intentions. Zelenskyy, who is not attending, has been meeting with European allies to coordinate pressure on Russia for a fair peace. He stressed that any diplomatic solution requires the joint efforts of Ukraine and its international partners.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that ceasefire negotiations have moved past a phased approach and are now focused on a comprehensive deal for the release of all remaining hostages. This shift comes as a Hamas delegation holds preliminary talks in Cairo and Israel prepares for a potential large-scale military operation in Gaza. Mediators reportedly see a window of opportunity for a deal, though Egypt's foreign minister indicated efforts are still being made to revive the earlier 60-day truce plan for a partial hostage exchange.</p>

While high temperatures continue, northern areas of the UK face a yellow weather warning for thunderstorms. The prolonged hot and dry conditions are also exacerbating drought conditions in several regions of England, leading to hosepipe bans.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of prehistoric whale that lived 26 million years ago, based on a well-preserved skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast. Named Janjucetus dullardi after the local who discovered it, the creature was a small, dolphin-sized predator with sharp, slicing teeth. It belongs to the mammalodontid group, which are distant, smaller relatives of modern baleen whales. The discovery provides new insights into early whale evolution in a region that researchers are calling a cradle for some of history's most unusual whales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The reboot of the animated series "King of the Hill" is reviewed as a comforting, almost fantastical portrayal of neighborly connection in an era of social fragmentation. The show returns with protagonist Hank Hill valuing community obligations, such as helping his isolated friend Bill, over a more comfortable life. While the series lightly touches on modern issues like ride-share apps and social media paranoia, it largely avoids the deep political and cultural divisions of contemporary America. This creates a vision of coexistence that feels both appealing and distant from reality.</p>

This reflects more aggressive competition among lenders, although rates remain significantly higher than pre-2022 levels. With 1.6 million fixed-rate deals expiring this year, the change will affect hundreds of thousands of borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
