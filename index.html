          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte affirmed the U.S.'s commitment to the alliance, emphasizing that President Trump and senior U.S. leaders are fully dedicated to NATO. Rutte addressed concerns about Washington potentially abandoning the bloc due to frustrations over uneven defense spending among member states. He urged European allies to focus on increasing defense investments and supporting Ukraine, rather than worrying about the U.S.'s commitment. The summit addressed defense spending targets and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Optimism surrounding the summit is tempered by existing tensions and the need for member states to meet their financial obligations.</p>

          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis unveiled a framework for regulating digital assets, aiming to provide clarity and prevent illicit activities. The framework seeks to define cryptocurrencies as either commodities or securities, enabling crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It also intends to reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulatory oversight of digital currencies. The proposed bill includes measures to combat money laundering and sanctions evasion, building on recent bipartisan momentum in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advocates and Medicaid recipients are expressing concerns over proposed work requirements for Medicaid, citing potential loss of coverage and negative health impacts. The requirements, set to begin in December 2026, mandate that able-bodied adults work, volunteer, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours a month. Examples from Arkansas and Georgia, where similar requirements were implemented, show significant increases in uninsured individuals and medical debt without boosting employment. Critics argue that these requirements create unnecessary barriers to healthcare access for vulnerable populations.</p>

Emory University Hospital kept Adriana Smith on organ support for over four months without the family's consent, allegedly due to Georgia's LIFE Act, which grants rights to unborn children with a detectable heartbeat. This decision prioritized the fetus's potential survival over the autonomy and wishes of Smith's family. The case highlights the conflict between the needs of a pregnant woman and a fetus, and the importance of respecting patient autonomy, even after death.</p>

President Trump announced the ceasefire, urging both sides to adhere to it, but later expressed dissatisfaction with alleged violations. Israel accused Iran of launching missiles after the truce took effect, while Iran denied the allegations. The situation remains tense, with Iran vowing to respond firmly to any further Israeli aggression.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to rescind the "roadless rule," a policy that has restricted logging on millions of acres of national forest land. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the plan, arguing that the rule impedes responsible timber production and increases wildfire risk. The decision is opposed by environmental groups, who argue that logging exacerbates climate change and intensifies wildfires. The announcement has sparked protests and criticism from both sides of the issue.</p>

          <p>A police watchdog report revealed deficiencies in child abuse training within West Mercia Police, the force involved in the Alfie Steele murder case. Alfie Steele, a nine-year-old boy, was killed by his mother and her partner after repeated police contact with the family. The report found no misconduct by individual officers but identified areas for improvement in training to better identify child abuse. Recommendations include improved warning markers on police logs and reviewing referral policies to children's services.</p>

          <p>Meta, along with other major tech companies, is not sponsoring San Francisco Pride this year, marking a shift in the tech industry's public support for the LGBTQ+ community. This decision follows policy changes at Meta, including scaling back diversity programs and easing content moderation, which have raised concerns among LGBTQ+ advocates. The lack of support from tech companies, particularly those based in San Francisco, is seen as a significant blow to the LGBTQ+ community. The organization's budget is down due to a drop in corporate sponsors.</p>
