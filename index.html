          <p>At least 51 people, including 15 children, have died in catastrophic flash floods in Texas. This article focuses on identifying some of the victims through stories shared by their families, painting a humanizing picture of the immense loss. Among those lost are an eight-year-old girl, Renee Smajstrla, who was "living her best life" at a summer camp, and Jane Ragsdale, the director of another nearby camp. The report also details the heroic final moments of Julian Ryan, who saved his family before being swept away, and names other young campers and adults who perished in the disaster, providing context on the community's profound grief.</p>

          <p>Chloe Childress, a recent high school graduate and counselor at Camp Mystic, is being remembered as a "loyal and beloved" member of her community after she was killed in the Texas floods. The head of her school described her as having "steady compassion that settled a room" and noted she died while upholding a selfless commitment to others. Childress, who was set to attend the University of Texas at Austin, was active in her school as co-president of the honor council and founder of a club to help senior citizens. The article places her death within the broader context of the disaster, which has claimed at least 80 lives.</p>

          <p>The death toll from severe flash floods in Texas Hill Country has climbed to at least 82, with 41 people still missing. Kerr County has been hit hardest, with 68 confirmed fatalities, including 28 children, many from the devastated Camp Mystic summer camp. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration, and search operations are continuing around the clock along the Guadalupe River, which rose an unprecedented 26 feet in 45 minutes. Officials are struggling to account for all individuals, particularly campers and those in RVs near the river, as the scale of the "horrendously ravaged" area becomes clear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to return to work prematurely. The proposed extension, championed by campaigners like Myleene Klass, would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, with further details on eligibility and duration to be determined after a consultation. This move is seen as a significant step in legally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched air strikes against Houthi-controlled ports in Yemen, including Hudaydah, Ras Issa, and al-Salif, in response to ongoing missile and drone attacks. The operation, involving approximately 20 fighter jets, also targeted a power station and the cargo ship Galaxy Leader, which the Houthis had hijacked and were allegedly using for surveillance. Israel's defense minister warned that the Houthis will continue to pay a heavy price for their actions. In retaliation, the Houthi-run media reported that their air defenses confronted the attack and subsequently launched 11 missiles and drones toward targets in Israel, vowing they are prepared for a prolonged confrontation.</p>

The cave, located at a high altitude, was previously known to have been used as a field hospital by militants.

          <p>A top White House economic adviser has indicated that the Trump administration may delay imposing tariffs on countries that are negotiating new trade deals in good faith. With the president's deadline approaching, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran stated that countries making necessary concessions but needing more time might see their deadline extended, though he did not specify which nations. Conversely, countries not negotiating in good faith could face higher tariffs. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers countered that the tariffs would likely lead to higher inflation for consumers and reduced competitiveness for American producers, posing significant risks to the economy.

          <p>Economists are calling for more decisive action from Chinese authorities to tackle the nation's persistent deflation and weak domestic demand. China's GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices, has been negative since the second quarter of 2023, and consumer prices have fallen for four consecutive months. Analysts, including Miao Yanliang from CICC, argue that attempts to revive inflation by cutting supply have yielded limited results because weak demand is the fundamental issue. The deflationary pressure is attributed to downturns in the property and financial sectors, as well as declining income expectations among Chinese households, necessitating stronger stimulus measures.

The government claims the authority to deport noncitizens whose presence threatens U.S. foreign policy.

The slowdown is particularly pronounced in affluent suburbs, suggesting that local resistance to densification, not just economic factors, is a primary cause.

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Long Beach, has quickly risen to become the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, positioning him as a leading figure in challenging the Trump administration. This article profiles Garcia, who came to the U.S. from Peru as a child and was undocumented for years before gaining citizenship, as a symbol of a different kind of American patriotism. He advocates for an aggressive anti-corruption agenda, aiming to hold figures like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk accountable. Garcia's ascent is seen as part of a generational shift in the Democratic party, which is increasingly looking for fighters to counter the Trump agenda.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Enforcement of Party Loyalty Reshapes the Republican Landscape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is systematically purging the Republican party of dissenters, prioritizing personal loyalty over ideological consistency or electoral success. The retirement of Senator Thom Tillis, after he opposed a Trump-backed bill, is presented as a prime example of this trend, alongside threats against other non-compliant Republicans like Rep. Thomas Massie. The author contends that Trump's actions are shrinking the party into a more compliant but smaller base, where obedience is the sole measure of value. This process, the article suggests, transforms the GOP from a political party into a personality-driven mob that values domination above all else.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar has experienced its most significant six-month decline since 1973, dropping over 10% this year and raising concerns about America's long-term financial dominance. Analysts suggest that political uncertainty, including tariff policies and attacks on the Federal Reserve, combined with a ballooning national debt, have shaken global investor confidence. Foreign investors have been selling American stocks and bonds, shifting preferences to international markets. While some experts view this as a temporary correction, others, like former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff, see it as an acceleration of a broader trend away from dollar dependency toward a more multi-polar currency system.

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood early Monday morning has left three people dead and ten others injured, including two juveniles who are expected to survive. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel reported that the incident occurred just before 1 a.m. at a gathering of around 40 people. Officers, who had been monitoring the block over the weekend due to previous disturbances, heard gunfire and rushed to the scene, where they recovered dozens of shell casings. One person has been taken into custody with a weapon, but their involvement is still unclear as the investigation continues into what police believe may have been an exchange of gunfire.</p>

Analysts note the surprise in the choice of these smaller economies over giants like Nigeria or South Africa.

          <p>Sources report that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has surveyed some financial institutions regarding the recent weakness of the U.S. dollar. The survey reportedly inquired about the causes of the dollar's decline and the outlook for the Chinese yuan. One source interpreted this as a sign of official concern about a potential sharp appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, which could impact China's export-driven economy. The dollar has had its worst first-half performance since 1973, while the yuan has remained relatively stable, creating pressure as trade negotiations with the U.S. continue and tariff deadlines approach.

TEC reported that communication was successfully re-established after the re-entry heat blackout but was then lost at an altitude of 26 km, just before the parachutes were scheduled to deploy.

Investors are reportedly concerned that Musk's deepening involvement in politics will serve as a distraction and could invite political retribution against his businesses. The move has also drawn public criticism from Donald Trump, marking an antagonistic turn in their relationship. Analysts suggest there is a growing exhaustion among Tesla shareholders who wish Musk would stay out of politics, especially during what is considered a crucial period for the electric car company's growth and stability.

The men, originally from Cuba, Mexico, and several Asian countries, were sent to South Sudan after a prolonged legal battle and weeks stuck at a military base in Djibouti. The deportation marks a significant and controversial expansion of the administration's immigration policies, securing agreements with third-party countries to accept deportees.

Conversely, a pro-Israeli group opposes the move, alleging it has created a divisive and unsafe environment, with some Jewish members reporting hostility and antisemitism.
