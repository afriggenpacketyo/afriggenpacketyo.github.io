Verstappen faced challenges with grip upon the race restart, leading to a series of incidents involving Leclerc and Russell. Following contact with Russell, Verstappen initially regained his position but was instructed by his engineer to concede due to racing regulations.

          <p>Ukraine claims responsibility for a large-scale drone attack deep within Russian territory, alleging the destruction of 40 military bombers in preparation for ceasefire talks in Istanbul. According to a Ukrainian security official, the operation, which took over a year and a half to plan, was supervised by President Zelenskyy. The drones were transported in containers via trucks and targeted airfields, including the Belaya air base in the Irkutsk region. Separately, explosions in western Russia caused bridges to collapse and trains to derail, resulting in casualties. </p>

          <p>The UK Defence Secretary has announced that an upcoming defence review will send a "message to Moscow," outlining plans to deter growing Russian aggression. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a "new era of threat" and will commit £1.5bn to build new factories to make munitions. This investment aims to strengthen the armed forces and boost Britain's industrial base, addressing deficiencies highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The government also confirmed a new “cyber and electromagnetic command” to lead the UK's defensive cyber operations. </p>

          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, emphasizing "shared humanity" and global unity, has gone viral amidst increasing tensions between the US and China. Yurong “Luanna” Jiang, the first Chinese woman selected as a student speaker, delivered her speech on the same day a judge blocked a Department of Homeland Security order seeking to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. The speech comes as the US State Department announced it would intensify screening and “aggressively” revoke student visas for Chinese nationals. The move has been attributed to espionage concerns. </p>

Despite government assurances, the women are experiencing uncertainty and hardship, relying on each other for support.
