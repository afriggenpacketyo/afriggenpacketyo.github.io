          <p>Conservative energy leaders are celebrating President Trump's initiative to reverse Biden-era restrictions on oil and gas development in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that the 2024 BLM rule undermined the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. Industry figures like Frank Lasee and Sterling Burnett praised the move for prioritizing energy security and economic growth over climate ideology. Trump vowed to unleash American energy during his campaign, and this action aligns with his broader efforts to roll back Biden's climate policies, though legal challenges from climate activists are anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to revoke the legal status of a four-year-old girl, identified as Sofia, and her family, who came to the US from Mexico in 2023 seeking medical treatment for a rare condition. The federal government had previously ended their humanitarian parole and ordered them to self-deport, prompting warnings from Sofia's doctors that she would likely die if forced to return. The reversal came after a national outcry and significant pressure from Democratic lawmakers, who argued that the family's situation warranted humanitarian aid. The administration restored their legal status, granting them humanitarian parole for one year, allowing Sofia to continue receiving life-saving treatment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly planning to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran, and is considering renaming other vessels named after civil rights figures.

Other ships potentially affected include the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman.

          <p>A 4-year-old Mexican girl receiving lifesaving medical care in Southern California has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the country, weeks after federal authorities initially said she could be deported. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother humanitarian parole for one year, allowing her to continue treatment she has been receiving since arriving in 2023. The decision came after the family was notified that their humanitarian parole was being revoked, sparking concerns about the girl's ability to access necessary medical care. The girl receives intravenous nutrition for short bowel syndrome, a treatment unavailable in Mexico.</p>

The move comes amid French President Emmanuel Macron's warning about the U.S. potentially abandoning Ukraine in favor of focusing on a potential conflict with China.

Scott allegedly hoped to have Ramon Morales-Reyes, a Mexican immigrant and the victim in his robbery and battery case, deported to prevent him from testifying. The letters, which led to Morales-Reyes' arrest by federal authorities, were written in English, a language he doesn't fluently speak or write. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem initially touted the arrest, but the investigation revealed Scott's plan through recorded jail calls and handwriting analysis.</p>
