          <p>A Milwaukee County circuit judge, Hannah Dugan, was arrested by the FBI for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, evade arrest by ICE agents. Dugan is accused of escorting Flores Ruiz out of the courtroom through a jury door after being informed of the administrative warrant for his arrest. Flores Ruiz was later apprehended, and Dugan now faces federal charges of obstruction, potentially leading to a six-year prison sentence if convicted. Her attorney protests the arrest, asserting it was not made in the interest of public safety. Optimism score is based on the fact that the crime is not violent, so the optimism score is higher than if it was.</p>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that tariffs levied by President Trump would disproportionately harm the poorest U.S. households. The study indicates that in 2026, taxes for the poorest 20% of households would rise significantly more than those in the top 1%. Economists expect consumers to bear at least some of the tax burden through higher prices, making tariffs a regressive policy. There is evidence that some retailers are already raising costs, exacerbating the financial strain on low-income families.</p>

          <p>Fire danger remains high in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania as crews continue to battle a large wildfire. Low humidity, warm temperatures, and gusty winds create conditions conducive to rapid fire spread. Prosecutors have charged a 19-year-old for failing to extinguish a bonfire, leading to the wildfire. Forecasters predict fire conditions may persist across the east coast due to dry and warm weather.</p>
