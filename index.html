          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, resulting in 241 confirmed fatalities, including passengers and people on the ground. The flight, bound for London Gatwick Airport, lost signal less than a minute after takeoff, according to FlightRadar24 data. Air India's CEO expressed condolences and focused on supporting the affected families, while Boeing offered its full support for the investigation. Indian aviation officials have committed to a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the crash, which is the first fatal crash of a Boeing Dreamliner. The plane had flown for 41,000 hours and had nearly 8,000 takeoffs, which is average for that aircraft and the year it was built.</p>

AMD aims to compete with Nvidia on price, promising lower operating costs and aggressive pricing for its chips, and plans to release new AI chips annually. The company expects the AI chip market to exceed $500 billion by 2028, as big cloud companies and countries are poised to spend hundreds of billions to build new data center clusters around GPUs.

However, California Attorney General Rob Bonta led a coalition of attorneys general in filing a lawsuit to challenge Trump’s laws, arguing Congress unlawfully acted to upend California’s emission rules.

          <p>Despite widespread fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted traditional measures of inflation, with recent data showing benign consumer and producer price increases. Three factors have contributed to this: companies stockpiling imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, the time it takes for tariffs to affect the real economy, and companies lacking pricing power due to consumer belt-tightening. Experts believe the limited impact in May is a reflection of pre-tariff stockpiling and a lagged pass-through of tariffs into import prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The state argues that Trump failed to meet the legal requirements for such a federal deployment, while the Department of Justice contends that limiting the military's role would grant a "rioters' veto" over federal law enforcement.

Critics argue the rollbacks favor fossil fuel interests at the expense of public health and the environment.
