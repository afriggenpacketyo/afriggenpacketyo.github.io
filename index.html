          <p>President Trump visited Fort Bragg after deploying the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests. During his speech, Trump characterized the protests as an "assault on peace" and claimed they were being carried out by rioters with foreign flags intending to invade the country. He vowed to "liberate" Los Angeles and called for jail time for those who burn the American flag. The estimated cost for deploying the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles for up to two months is $134 million, according to a top Pentagon official. Trump also referred to the protesters as "paid insurrectionists".</p>

He suggests that these policies could fuel antisemitism and undermine the long-term security and well-being of Jewish communities globally.

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to ongoing protests will cost approximately $134 million, according to a Pentagon official. Acting Pentagon Comptroller Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell stated that this estimate primarily covers housing, travel, and food expenses for the troops. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment as necessary to ensure the safety of American citizens and the ability of ICE agents to perform their duties. The troops, consisting of 4,000 National Guard members and about 700 Marines, are being funded by the military's Operation & Maintenance accounts.</p>

          <p>A major international study has revealed a two-way link between screen time and the emotional well-being of children. The study, analyzing data from nearly 300,000 children, found that increased screen time is associated with aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Children already struggling with socioemotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Experts recommend limiting recreational screen time for children between 2 and 5 years old to one hour per day on weekdays and three hours on weekends, and encourage children to interact with friends and family to develop resilience and emotional skills.</p>

While "No Mow May" and "Let It Bloom June" aim to support pollinators and biodiversity, some experts claim that reducing lawn care can be good for physical and mental well-being. Yard work can lead to muscle strains, back pain, and joint injuries, and pesticides can pose health risks. Natural environments can promote mindfulness and reduce cortisol levels, helping people feel calmer, while gardening can combat loneliness by encouraging community engagement.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance has postponed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to multiple weather delays. The launch, initially scheduled for Friday, is now set for June 16. This mission will deploy another 27 Kuiper satellites into low Earth orbit, increasing the constellation size to 54 satellites. Amazon aims to accelerate its satellite deployments to begin delivering service to customers later this year, competing with SpaceX's Starlink. The company must launch half of its total constellation by July 2026 to meet FCC requirements.</p>

          <h2>Belief in 'Love at First Sight' on the Rise, Survey Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates a growing belief in "love at first sight" among American adults, with 60% expressing faith in the concept, a significant increase from 2014. The shift may be linked to the prevalence of dating apps, which encourage quick assessments of compatibility. While psychologists acknowledge the possibility of strong initial connections, they caution against relying solely on such feelings, as passionate love differs from the compassionate love that develops over time. The survey also reveals that most singles believe love can last forever, suggesting a persistent romantic idealism despite the challenges of modern dating.</p>
