          <p>An immersive show in London called 'Elvis Evolution' is facing backlash from attendees who feel misled. The experience was initially advertised as featuring an AI-generated hologram of Elvis, but the final production uses upscaled archive footage instead. While some visitors have praised the show, many who paid up to £300 for tickets have called it "atrocious," demanding refunds and accusing the organizers of exploiting fans. Organizers state the creative direction changed and that the show is a theatrical experience, not a traditional concert.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court justice in Brazil has warned former President Jair Bolsonaro that he could face imprisonment for violating a court-ordered social media ban. The warning came after allies circulated a video of a speech Bolsonaro gave to journalists, which the judge interpreted as a deliberate attempt to bypass the restriction. Bolsonaro is under investigation for allegedly planning a coup and has been ordered to wear an ankle monitor and avoid contact with foreign governments. The incident has sparked a debate in Brazil over the scope of social media bans for public figures.</p>

          <p>A day of national mourning is being observed in Bangladesh after a military F-7 training jet crashed into a school in the capital, Dhaka, killing at least 27 people. Many of the victims were students at the Milestone School and College, and over 170 others were injured. The air force reported that the jet experienced a mechanical fault shortly after takeoff, and the pilot, who was also killed, attempted to steer it away from crowded areas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the Trump administration's increasing reliance on tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, often in place of traditional sanctions. Tariffs are presented as a more flexible and unilateral instrument that aligns with the "America First" agenda, allowing for rapid pressure on trade partners like China, Mexico, and the EU. Unlike sanctions, tariffs generate revenue and can be adjusted quickly, but they also create market uncertainty and risk escalating trade tensions. The analysis notes this strategy blurs the lines between trade policy and punitive measures, using economic leverage to address non-trade issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>San Francisco officials are poised to approve a new policy that effectively bans homeless people from living in recreational vehicles throughout the city. The measure establishes a two-hour parking limit for oversized vehicles, targeting the at least 400 RVs used as shelter by those unable to afford housing. While Mayor Daniel Lurie supports the policy to clear streets, critics argue it is cruel and lacks a sufficient plan to house the displaced individuals. A limited permit program will exempt some current RV residents, provided they work with the city to find alternative housing.</p>

          <p>In a series of recent interviews, Hunter Biden has launched sharp criticisms against figures within the Democratic party, Hollywood, and the media.

Biden directed harsh words at actor George Clooney for calling on his father to step aside, and also condemned former Obama aide David Axelrod and CNN anchor Jake Tapper. His comments represent a departure from typical Democratic messaging, adopting a more confrontational tone that mirrors tactics often used by his political opponents.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the expectations placed upon authors from the Balkans by the Western publishing industry. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to focus on themes of cultural trauma and historical conflict, suggesting a preference for stories that exoticize the region. Schnabl argues that this limits Balkan writers to narratives of victimhood and post-socialist disillusionment, overlooking a diverse range of contemporary stories. She calls for publishers to embrace a wider variety of voices and narratives that challenge, rather than reinforce, preconceived notions about the region.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for a new tenancy in the UK has risen by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. The sharp increase, driven by high demand and a shortage of available properties, has brought the average monthly rent to £1,283. The article highlights the financial pressure on tenants, with some forced to turn down jobs or rely on parental help to cover costs. While the rate of rent increases has recently started to slow, particularly in major cities, the cumulative rise continues to impact affordability for many. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air photographs of China's J-35 fighter jet provide strong evidence that the fifth-generation aircraft is entering production and nearing operational readiness. The images clearly show the jets with official Chinese navy markings and "Flying Shark" tail insignia, confirming their integration into the naval aviation force. Military analysts note that the visible serial numbers suggest the fighters are part of an initial production run. This development indicates a significant step forward in China's goal of equipping its newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, with advanced stealth fighter capabilities.</p>

          <p>The family of Keith McAllister, the 61-year-old man who died after being pulled into an MRI machine on Long Island, claims the facility's technician is responsible for the fatal accident. According to his daughter, the technician invited McAllister into the room to assist his wife but failed to warn him about the danger of the metal chain he was wearing. The machine's powerful magnet pulled him in, and he remained stuck for nearly an hour before being freed, suffering several heart attacks afterward. The family's account contradicts initial reports and highlights the critical importance of safety protocols around MRI machines.</p>

          <p>The preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has sparked controversy rather than providing closure for the 260 victims. The investigation is focusing on why both fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff, causing a total loss of engine power. A leaked portion of the cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying it. This detail has led to intense speculation about pilot error or intent, prompting both Indian and US investigators to condemn the leaks as "premature and speculative."</p>

He is the only officer to face conviction and imprisonment directly related to the raid. The judge's sentence exceeded a Department of Justice recommendation for no prison time, with the judge stating that not imprisoning him would minimize the jury's verdict and the severity of his actions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 immigrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The court order allows the government to end the program, which grants deportation protection and work permits, while a lawsuit challenging the decision continues. The administration argues that conditions in both countries have improved enough for their nationals to return safely. Immigrant advocacy groups are alarmed by the ruling, warning that it will upend lives and place vulnerable people at risk by forcing them to return to still-dangerous home countries.</p>

          <p>Critics and political opponents are accusing President Trump of attempting to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. They point to a recent flurry of social media posts on unrelated and often inflammatory topics, such as demanding the Washington Commanders football team revert to its old name. Figures like former congressman Joe Walsh and Rev. Al Sharpton claim these actions are a "desperate attempt to distract" from the administration's handling of the Epstein case and the resulting backlash from some of his own supporters. The White House maintains that the president is being transparent on the issue.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining. They expose the hypocrisy of countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union, which have maintained their own self-defeating internal trade barriers for years. The economic pressure from US tariffs is creating an incentive for these nations to streamline their domestic economies by removing long-standing obstacles to commerce and regulation. The author suggests this forced self-reflection could lead to significant long-term economic benefits that might otherwise have been ignored. (not investment advice)</p>

Initially, more than 160 people, mostly tourists in hard-hit Kerr County, were reported missing, sparking a massive verification effort. The sharp revision in the numbers is common after large-scale disasters, as initial reports are often chaotic.
