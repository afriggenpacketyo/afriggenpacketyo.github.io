The Real ID law was passed in 2005 to enhance the security of state-issued identification, and travelers with non-compliant IDs should arrive at the airport at least three hours before departure.</p>

            <p>A hearing has begun to determine potential remedies for Google's antitrust violations, with the Justice Department advocating for the divestiture of the Chrome browser. The DOJ argues that Google's dominance stifles competition and innovation, and that separating Chrome would allow rivals to compete more effectively. Google defends its position, arguing that it earned its market share through innovation and that the proposed remedies are flawed. The outcome could significantly reshape Google's business and the broader tech landscape.</p>
