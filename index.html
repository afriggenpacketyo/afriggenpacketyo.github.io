          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule ahead of the August 1st deadline. Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet celebrated a significant reduction in duties from 49% to 19%, viewing it as positive for the nation's economy. Similarly, Thailand's finance minister expressed that the new 19% rate reflects a strong partnership with the U.S., though the government is preparing support for affected businesses. Meanwhile, Taiwan faces a temporary 20% tariff, a reduction from the previously announced 32%, with its president noting that negotiations are ongoing for further decreases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formalized a new global trade framework by signing an executive order that adjusts "reciprocal" tariffs for numerous countries. The updated duties vary widely, with nations like Syria, Laos, and Myanmar facing rates of 40% or higher, while some Asian partners like Thailand and Malaysia received reductions to 19%. A significant new provision imposes an additional 40% tariff on any goods found to be transshipped to evade duties, a measure analysts believe is aimed at China. Trade experts warn that despite these finalized rates, further tariff increases and continued uncertainty are likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An office cleaner has shared her terrifying experience of coming face-to-face with the gunman responsible for the deadly shooting at 345 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Sebije Nelovic, who has worked in the building for 27 years, was on the 33rd floor when she heard gunshots and saw the suspect, Shane Devon Tamura, shatter a glass door and point an AR-15-style rifle at her. She immediately identified herself as a cleaning lady and fled, hiding in a locked closet for hours while the attack continued.

          <p>During a National Transportation Safety Board hearing, a Federal Aviation Administration official admitted that an air traffic controller failed to properly warn a commercial airliner about an approaching Army helicopter before their fatal collision in January. The crash, which killed 67 people, occurred amid high traffic volume at Ronald Reagan National Airport, where controllers were reportedly "pushing the line" on safety. Testimony revealed the controller was juggling communications with 21 aircraft just before the incident. The FAA has since reduced the airport's arrival rate and limited certain procedures that contributed to the congested airspace.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who passed away this year, has stated that she wanted the sealed documents related to the case to be made public. In an interview, her siblings expressed that Giuffre sought "transparency and justice" for Epstein's victims and fought for the files' release until the end. The family also reacted to President Trump's recent comments, stating they were "shocked" by his use of the word "stolen" to describe what happened to their sister. They clarified that she was a person who was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell, not an object.</p>

          <p>Annual tuition fees for undergraduate degrees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. The government stated the hike is in line with inflation, while universities have been expressing growing concern about funding pressures. The Office for Students has warned that many universities expect to be in a financial deficit by 2025. In addition to the fee increase, maintenance loans for student living costs have also gone up, though housing costs continue to rise sharply across the UK.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels baseball team opted to be minor buyers at the trade deadline, a strategy that has left some analysts questioning the direction of the franchise. Despite being under .500 and having long playoff odds, the team acquired a few veteran players rather than trading assets to rebuild for the future. General Manager Perry Minasian defended the decision, stating it was important for the team's young core to play meaningful, competitive games in August and September. However, critics argue the "mid" team missed an opportunity to acquire prospects and truly build for long-term success.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which provides compensation to victims and is at risk of being depleted. The proposal would raise half of the money, $9 billion, by extending a surcharge on the monthly bills of customers of the state's three largest utilities. The other $9 billion would come from the shareholders of those same utilities: Southern California Edison, PG&E, and SDG&E.

          <p>Researchers have solved a long-standing botanical mystery, discovering that the modern potato evolved from an ancestor of the tomato around 9 million years ago. A study published in the journal Cell explains that the potato was created through a hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species. The tomato parent provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form starchy tubers, while the other parent contributed a gene that helps control their growth. This finding demonstrates how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

          <p>An investigation has uncovered that China is systematically evading U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. The illicit transfers occur in international waters, where tankers, often with their identification trackers turned off, move crude oil from one ship to another. This trade, which generates billions of dollars for Iran, is seen as undermining U.S. foreign policy and potentially funding Iran's nuclear program. Despite multiple rounds of U.S. sanctions targeting this activity, the investigation found that the ship-to-ship transfers are ramping up, with China not recognizing the unilateral U.S. measures.</p>

          <p>In the first federal jury trial of its kind, plaintiffs are seeking $345 million in damages from Tesla over a 2019 crash in Florida that killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend. The lawsuit alleges that the driver, George McGee, was using the car's Enhanced Autopilot system and mistakenly believed it would automatically brake for obstacles. Attorneys for the victims' families argue that Tesla dangerously overstated the system's capabilities, leading to driver overreliance. Tesla's defense counters that the driver was at fault and that the company provides clear instructions on the system's proper use.</p>

          <p>Two senior U.S. officials, special envoy Steve Witkoff and ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are scheduled to make a highly unusual visit to Gaza to inspect a food distribution site. The visit comes amid growing international concern over a severe humanitarian crisis, with aid workers warning of a "politically manmade famine" in the territory. President Trump has expressed frustration that aid is not reaching Palestinians, and the officials will report their findings directly back to him. The high-level visit reflects the increasing pressure on the U.S. and Israel to address the catastrophic conditions faced by Gaza's civilian population.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that surpassed expectations for both revenue and profit, with sales growing 13% to $167.7 billion. The company's high-margin advertising and e-commerce segments showed particular strength. However, investors were disappointed by the relatively modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a mixed forecast for the upcoming quarter. Despite the strong overall performance, the stock fell in after-hours trading, reflecting market concerns about AWS's competitive position in the AI race and the slightly cautious operating income guidance.

          <p>Experts are expressing concern about the increasing use of caffeine pouches among teenagers, a trend popular in the U.S. that may be spreading. These small, discreet pouches are placed in the mouth and deliver a rapid, potent dose of caffeine, with some containing as much as two cups of coffee. Health professionals worry that young people have a lower tolerance for caffeine and could easily consume dangerous amounts, leading to side effects like rapid heart rate or seizures. The products are often promoted on social media for boosting gym performance or academic alertness, raising fears of dependency and overuse.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major cities that have long powered the economy of China's southern Guangdong province, are reporting underperforming GDP growth. The slowdown is attributed to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and a domestic property market downturn, which has dampened investment. In Shenzhen, fixed-asset investment fell by 10.9% and real estate development dropped 15.1% year-on-year, indicating a decline in investor confidence. Analysts are now calling for more robust government action to revive business activity and counteract the dual economic headwinds facing these critical industrial centers. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation, which aims to protect minors from harmful material, imposes heavy fines for non-compliance. However, BBC Verify found that legitimate public interest content, such as parliamentary debates and historical art, is being restricted for users who have not verified their age. Experts warn that companies are over-applying the law, risking the suppression of important public discourse in their efforts to avoid penalties.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a policy change that will restrict its main civil service internship scheme exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The move, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves and harness a broader range of talent. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupation when they were 14. Successful interns will also be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program, as part of a wider effort to diversify the traditionally privileged institution.</p>

Newsom framed the plan as a defensive measure to prevent Republicans from "rigging the game" to hold the House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. Under the proposal, the legislature would create new maps for voters to approve, which would remain in effect until 2030. California would then return to its current independent redistricting commission system for the 2032 cycle.</p>

This total sets a new single-year record for Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. Zakrzewski, an Air Force veteran, was put to death by lethal injection. His case had drawn attention from opponents of capital punishment, who noted that his jury's recommendation for death was a narrow 7-5 vote, a margin that would not be sufficient for a death sentence under current state law.</p>
