          <p>Following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, savers are facing diminishing returns on high-yield accounts. However, opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October still presents strategic advantages, such as locking in current rates before they potentially drop further. With the CME Group's FedWatch tool indicating a high probability of another rate cut at the end of the month, the article suggests that proactive savers can benefit from compounding interest by acting sooner rather than later. Financial institutions may also preemptively lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent money manager and former bond trader Howard Rubin has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts. The indictment alleges that over a decade, Rubin and his former assistant operated a network that involved brutalizing women in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse. Prosecutors claim the encounters often went beyond the women's consent, causing significant pain and injury. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking and ordered to pay millions in damages to six women.</p>

          <p>The gunman responsible for the July mass shooting in Midtown Manhattan, Shane Tamura, was found to have low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the brain disease and asked for his brain to be studied, believing the NFL had concealed its dangers. While the diagnosis confirms his concerns, CTE experts caution that the finding does not fully explain his violent actions, as human behavior is highly complex. The case highlights ongoing concerns about the prevalence of CTE even in amateur contact sports.</p>

          <p>During the Seattle Seahawks' recent victory over the Arizona Cardinals, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba's frustrated reaction to a holding penalty was broadcast to a national audience. After a flag nullified a touchdown, Smith-Njigba audibly yelled an expletive which was picked up by head referee Alex Kemp's open microphone. Kemp paused his announcement and glared at the player but did not issue an additional penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, a decision praised by the broadcast commentators. Despite the incident, Smith-Njigba played a key role in the game, making a crucial catch that set up the game-winning field goal for the Seahawks.</p>

          <p>The National Personnel Records Center, a branch of the National Archives, improperly released a mostly unredacted version of Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military file to a political opponent's ally. The documents, containing sensitive personal information like her Social Security number and home addresses, were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The National Archives acknowledged the release was a serious error, stating a technician failed to follow standard procedures, and has since apologized to the congresswoman.

          <p>Sinclair has announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations, following a temporary suspension of the program. The preemption by Sinclair and Nexstar Media Group came after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments about the alleged murder of a conservative activist. The situation sparked a debate over media influence and First Amendment rights, particularly after an FCC commissioner suggested stations could risk their licenses. In its statement, Sinclair emphasized its commitment to responsible broadcasting and respectful dialogue, while noting that Disney's ABC has not yet adopted its proposed measures to strengthen accountability.</p>

          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey marks a new chapter in his nearly decade-long, tumultuous relationship with President Donald Trump. Their interactions began with Trump praising Comey's 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails but quickly soured after Trump's inauguration. Key points of conflict include a private dinner where Trump allegedly demanded loyalty, Comey's public confirmation of the Russia investigation, and Trump's subsequent firing of Comey in 2017. The feud escalated with Comey's critical memoir and testimony, and Trump's persistent public attacks, culminating in the current charges related to Comey's 2020 congressional testimony.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the UK's Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who had the whip withdrawn for voting against the government's two-child benefit cap, which was the first major rebellion of Keir Starmer's premiership. This move comes as the Labour government faces increasing internal and external pressure to abolish the controversial policy, which prevents parents from claiming certain credits for more than two children. Recently, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson signaled that scrapping the cap is now under consideration by ministers.</p>

          <p>A UK judge has thrown out a terrorism charge against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara. The charge stemmed from an allegation that he displayed a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, which he denied.

Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence his activism regarding the conflict in Gaza and affirmed his solidarity with the Palestinian cause.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card delinquencies rising, understanding the timeline of consequences for late payments is crucial for consumers. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major threshold is at 30 days past due, when the late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, causing a drop in your credit score. After 60 days, issuers may impose a high penalty APR, and by 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts and potential account closure can occur. Proactive communication with lenders before missing a payment is the most effective strategy to mitigate damage.</p>

This opinion article argues that pointing out an opponent's hypocrisy is a dodge that avoids engaging with the core principles of liberal norms. The author notes that while both the right and left accuse each other of selective outrage, this approach only serves to judge people rather than ideas, ultimately justifying the abandonment of free speech principles. The piece contends that a principled defense of open debate is necessary, regardless of which political side is perceived as being censorious at any given moment.</p>

He recalled Friedkin's improvisational, high-energy approach for "To Live and Die in L.A.," which included a famously dangerous car chase he drove himself.

For a $150,000 loan, the current average monthly payment is approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term and $1,452 for a 15-year term. This represents a modest saving of around $16 per month compared to rates from earlier in the year. While the immediate savings are not dramatic, the potential for future rate cuts in late 2025 and 2026 makes exploring home equity financing a potentially worthwhile option for homeowners needing a large sum of money.

          <p>The number of federal student loan borrowers awaiting processing for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program has grown to 74,510. This program allows public service workers to make retroactive payments for past periods of forbearance or deferment to qualify for debt cancellation sooner. The backlog has swelled under the Trump administration, particularly after the legal blockage of the SAVE repayment plan pushed many borrowers into forbearance, freezing their PSLF progress. Despite the significant delays, consumer advocates still recommend that eligible borrowers apply for the buyback while also exploring other repayment options to continue making progress toward forgiveness.</p>

          <p>During a historic Seattle Mariners game where the team clinched its first division title in 24 years, catcher Cal Raleigh hit his 60th home run of the season. The significant ball was caught by a fan, Glenn Mutti-Driscoll, who immediately gifted it to 12-year-old Marcus Ruelos, a stranger sitting nearby. Understanding the ball's importance to the player, Marcus decided to return it to Raleigh in exchange for a signed bat, forgoing a potentially massive monetary reward. The selfless exchange went viral, highlighting a moment of sportsmanship and kindness that stood in stark contrast to other recent fan behaviors.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, has been indicted by the Department of Justice on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The charges are linked to his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020, where he was questioned about his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. The indictment comes just days after President Trump publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute Comey, raising concerns about political influence over the Justice Department. Comey's tenure was marked by controversy, including his firing by Trump in 2017 while leading the Russia probe.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has announced the seizure of more than $220 million worth of cocaine from multiple drug-smuggling vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Cutter Midgett intercepted four boats off the coasts of Mexico and Central America, seizing over 21,000 pounds of the narcotic. In a separate operation, the Cutter Diligence seized another 8,700 pounds of cocaine from a vessel north of Panama. The Coast Guard released an image showing one of the alleged drug boats on fire, explaining that such vessels are typically sunk after narcotics are removed to prevent them from becoming maritime hazards.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup, known for its uniquely tribal and loud atmosphere, is being held at Bethpage Black in New York, a location expected to amplify the event's intensity. Unlike typical golf tournaments, the Ryder Cup encourages boisterous, partisan crowds that can emotionally affect players, especially those on the visiting European team. This article explores the history of crowd behavior at the event, including the heckling of players like Colin Montgomerie and Rory McIlroy, and anticipates that the New York audience will bring an even higher level of engagement. European players are attempting to desensitize themselves to the expected environment, which McIlroy predicts will inevitably lead to an incident.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed a large number of generals, admirals, and their staff from across the globe to attend a meeting at Quantico, Virginia. The gathering is considered rare, if not unprecedented, due to its size, in-person requirement, and short notice, with the Pentagon providing no specific agenda to the leaders or the press. The meeting comes after Hegseth announced plans earlier this year to reduce the number of four-star generals and flag officers by 20%.

While the government touts benefits for citizens, the proposal has drawn criticism from opposition parties and civil liberties groups, who raise concerns about mass surveillance, data security, and its effectiveness in stopping small boat crossings.

          <p>A retirement strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods like the 4% rule. This approach involves converting one-third of a retiree's savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, typically a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and unexpected costs. By blending the security of a pension-like income stream with the flexibility of market investments, the strategy aims to reduce stress from market volatility and provide a stable financial foundation for retirees.
