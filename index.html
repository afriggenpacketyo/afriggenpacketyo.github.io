          <p>The State Department has elevated its travel advisory for Israel to Level 4, advising U.S. citizens against traveling there due to ongoing armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest following attacks exchanged between Israel and Iran. The advisory highlights the unpredictable security situation in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and warns against travel to the West Bank and Gaza due to terrorism and armed conflict. The U.S. government is limited in its ability to provide consular services in Gaza, and Americans are urged to take precautions if they choose to travel there. The U.S. Embassy in Israel was closed, and House Speaker Mike Johnson postponed a planned trip to Israel's parliament due to the conflict.</p>

          <p>AMD shares experienced a significant rise after Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target on the stock, expressing optimism about a "snapback" for the company's graphics-processing units (GPUs) in the fourth quarter. This expectation is tied to AMD moving past the bulk of charges related to new U.S. license requirements on semiconductor exports to China. The company recently unveiled its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including a full-server rack called Helios, which is expected to be crucial for AI customers. AMD CEO Lisa Su presented these products with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, further boosting confidence in the company's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article reflects on the unusual scene in Washington, D.C., where supporters and opponents of Donald Trump mingled at the American History Museum, momentarily setting aside their political differences. The author observed a neutral atmosphere where families with opposing political views could coexist, admiring historical artifacts. Outside the museum, security measures were heightened due to both the U.S. Army 250th Birthday Parade and anti-Trump protests, raising questions about the financial costs of such security. The author notes that face-to-face interactions allowed for respectful political discourse, suggesting that physical interaction can mitigate hatred and fear, a phenomenon often undermined by online siloing.</p>

This announcement follows Trump's social media post directing ICE to conduct the largest mass deportation program in history.

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that the ethnicity of individuals involved in grooming gangs has been "shied away from" by authorities in England and Wales. The report highlights that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang perpetrators, hindering accurate assessment at a national level. However, local data from three police forces indicates a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation. The report criticizes the authorities for avoiding the topic due to fears of appearing racist, which has allowed abuse to continue unchecked. The government has apologized to victims and announced a new national inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>

These attacks have forced Tehran to partially suspend production, raising concerns about potential threats to Iran's energy production and supply. Iran, a major player in the global energy sector, relies heavily on hydrocarbons, with substantial reserves of natural gas and crude oil. The sanctions imposed on Iran have already crippled its economy, and further targeting of its energy facilities could lead to a spike in global oil and gas prices.</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, while state Senator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded, in what Governor Tim Walz described as politically motivated shootings. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, was captured after a manhunt. Authorities say the suspect was dressed in a manner to appear like a police officer. The vehicle was towed away from the Hortmans' home. Authorities say there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found inside the vehicle. More than 50 individuals were listed, including officials beyond Minnesota, abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.</p>

The dismissed juror was a 41-year-old Black man who claimed to reside in the Bronx, but doubts arose about whether he actually lived there or in New Jersey.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is likely to maintain current interest rates this week, which has implications for various financial aspects of consumers' lives.

Mortgage rates are expected to remain relatively stable, keeping housing affordability a challenge. Auto loan rates, which are fixed, are not directly tied to the Fed, but rising car prices are increasing payments. Federal student loan rates are set annually, providing some stability for borrowers, although forgiveness options are diminishing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This satirical piece is written as a diary entry from the perspective of former President Donald Trump, lamenting that his 79th birthday parade did not meet his expectations. The author humorously depicts Trump's desire for a grand, authoritarian-style tank parade, contrasting it with the actual event, which focused on the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary. The piece satirizes Trump's longing for power, his disdain for historical facts, and his idealized vision of a government resembling those of China or North Korea. The entry concludes with a complaint about the parade's shortcomings and a demand for improvement on his 80th birthday.</p>
