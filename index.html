          <p>The once-close alliance between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated, leading to public attacks and potential ramifications for the Republican Party. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his suggestion of a new political party have caused concern among some Republicans. The billionaire's past financial support for the GOP raises questions about future donations, especially with the midterm elections approaching. While some downplay the feud, others worry about the impact of Musk's influence on key issues and the party's unity. The situation remains fluid, with some signs of a possible reconciliation, but the long-term effects on the Republican landscape are uncertain. The optimism score is based on the potential for reconciliation and the resilience of the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new, more public-facing role, just two days after resigning as chairman. He will lead the party's "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf attributed his initial departure to exhaustion after 11 months of intense work building the party. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf regrets his actions and will now appear more frequently in the media. His reinstatement follows criticism of a party member's stance on burqas, which Yusuf deemed inconsistent with party policy.</p>

          <p>A study by Inspired Taste has revealed distinct regional preferences for pasta shapes across the United States. Spaghetti is the national favorite, dominating in 20 states, while penne is a close second, leading in 17 states, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Elbows, despite being the fourth most popular nationally, are not a favorite in any single state. California favors fettuccine, while Hawaii and New Mexico prefer angel hair pasta; South Dakota, Alaska, and Montana favor rotini.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to transport undocumented migrants, including gang members, into the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. His attorney argues that the charges are an abuse of power and that Abrego Garcia is not the leader of an international smuggling conspiracy. President Trump distanced himself from the decision to return Abrego Garcia, stating that it was the Department of Justice's decision.</p>

Trump also accused Musk of being "disrespectful to the office of the president" and asserted that the Republican party is more united than ever despite the feud.

Sophia Dunkley made 26 at the top of the order as England rejigged their batting line-up, while Alice Capsey finished unbeaten on 20 in another one-sided affair. West Indies, who were again without star all-rounder Hayley Matthews because of a shoulder injury, had slipped to 4-3 inside the first four overs after England chose to bowl first under gloomy skies.

While these initiatives have been adopted, they lack concrete political steps or financial agreements. Some see this as a form of social maturity, while others view it as symbolic gestures in a politically paralyzed legislature.

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced that the government will seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the legality of migrant turnbacks at the border. This decision follows a Berlin court ruling that deemed the refusal to allow three Somali nationals to enter Germany unlawful. The court stated that Germany should have followed the EU's Dublin Regulation before sending the migrants back to Poland. Dobrindt maintained that Germany needs to crack down on illegal migration to prevent the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from gaining more influence.</p>

The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to "facilitate" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.
