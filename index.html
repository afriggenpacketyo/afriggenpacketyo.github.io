        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Game 1 loss to the Indiana Pacers, Cleveland Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson expressed concerns about the Pacers' physical style of play, suggesting it crossed a line and contributed to injuries sustained by Evan Mobley and DeAndre Hunter. Atkinson clarified he didn't consider the plays "dirty," but excessive physicality led to Mobley aggravating an ankle injury and Hunter dislocating a thumb. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle defended his team's approach, stating he was protecting his players. Mobley and Hunter were subsequently ruled out for Game 2. This article provides insights into the tensions and physical nature of playoff basketball. Optimism Score: 50</p>
