          <p>The president-elect of the Oxford Union, George Abaraonye, has lost a no-confidence vote following backlash over social media posts that appeared to celebrate the death of U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The motion to remove him passed with the required two-thirds majority. Abaraonye is disputing the result, alleging procedural failures and unsupervised access to the ballot collection email. The controversy has drawn significant attention, with Kirk's allies threatening to urge American political figures to boycott the prestigious debating society if the ousting had not been successful.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is demanding $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for federal investigations conducted into his activities after his first term. The claims were submitted through an administrative process, a common precursor to a lawsuit, and relate to the Russia election interference probe and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. Trump has publicly commented on the demands, suggesting any settlement money received would be donated. The situation presents a potential conflict of interest, as any settlement might require approval from officials he appointed during his second term.</p>

While President Trump initially stated the construction would not interfere with the historic residence, the work has proven to be more extensive than first suggested.

          <p>Toy manufacturer Mattel reported third-quarter financial results that missed Wall Street estimates, causing its shares to drop in after-hours trading. The company's performance was negatively impacted by ongoing global tariffs and shifting retailer ordering patterns, which led to a 12% decline in North American sales. Global sales for key brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price fell by 17% and 19% respectively, although Hot Wheels sales saw an 8% increase. Despite the quarterly miss, Mattel issued full-year guidance projecting a net sales increase of 1% to 3%.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total compensation for the 2025 fiscal year rose by 22% to $96.5 million, largely driven by stock awards tied to the company's strong share performance. The surge in Microsoft's stock value is attributed to the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence and the growth of its Azure cloud business. The pay package includes over $84 million in stock awards and more than $9.5 million in cash incentives. This increase comes despite recent workforce turmoil, including the elimination of over 15,000 jobs within the company during 2025.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Citywest Hotel in Dublin, which is being used to house asylum seekers, escalated into violence on Tuesday evening. Demonstrators attacked Irish police with missiles and fireworks and set a police vehicle on fire. A line of riot police was deployed to prevent the crowd, estimated to be several thousand people, from reaching the hotel. Ireland's Justice Minister, Jim O'Callaghan, condemned the violence, stating it was unacceptable and that those involved would be brought to justice. A water cannon was reportedly brought to the scene, marking its first potential use since being purchased two years ago.</p>

In a statement, the administration framed the privately funded, $250 million project as a "visionary addition" in line with historical improvements by past presidents. The controversy grew after images of the construction went viral online. In response to potential security risks, the neighboring Treasury Department has reportedly instructed its staff not to share photos of the demolition work, citing concerns about revealing sensitive structural details.</p>

          <p>Spain's La Liga has canceled its plan to stage a match between Villarreal and Barcelona in Miami this December, citing "uncertainty" from the widespread criticism the proposal faced in Spain. The league expressed deep regret, stating that holding official matches abroad is a crucial step for global growth, especially when competing with the financial power of England's Premier League. The plan had been met with protests from the Spanish footballers' association and legal complaints from Real Madrid. European governing body UEFA had also reluctantly approved the match while reiterating its opposition to domestic games being played overseas.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat skyrocketed by over 146% on Tuesday, marking its best trading day ever. The massive rally began after the stock was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and was further fueled by an announcement of expanded distribution through a new deal with Walmart. The surge appears to have triggered a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of the stock's available float had been sold short. This marks a dramatic reversal for the company, whose stock had fallen to penny-stock levels after years of poor performance.</p>

          <p>A coalition of unions and corporate watchdog groups has launched the "Take Back Tesla" campaign, urging shareholders to vote against a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth nearly $1 trillion. The group argues the plan is "outrageous" and fails to require Musk to focus on Tesla over his other business and political activities, which they claim have damaged the brand. The campaign encourages public pension funds and individual investors to reject the proposal. This new plan follows a Delaware court's decision last year to void his previous $56 billion pay package.</p>

The company now projects adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion for 2025, signaling confidence despite challenges in the electric vehicle market. GM's strong performance was bolstered by gains in its China and international operations, which helped offset a decline in its North American profit margin.

          <p>A new study by investment firm Schroders indicates that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before reaching age 70, forgoing the higher monthly payments that come with delaying. While financial experts often advise waiting to maximize benefits, many respondents cited the immediate need for income in retirement as their primary reason for claiming early. Concerns about the long-term financial stability of the Social Security program also contribute to the trend. The survey highlights a significant gap between the income retirees believe they need and what they typically generate.</p>

          <p>Gold and silver prices experienced a sharp decline, with gold futures seeing their largest one-day drop in over a decade and silver tumbling by more than 8%. The sell-off brought a halt to a powerful rally in precious metals and was attributed to easing trade tensions, a stronger U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggesting the market was overbought. Despite the significant drop, some analysts view it as a temporary correction rather than the end of the bullish trend.

HELOCs feature variable rates that can adjust downward following a Fed cut, unlike fixed-rate home equity loans. Currently, average HELOC rates are already lower than those for home equity loans, offering a more affordable borrowing option in a cooling rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>
