          <p>During an emotional public hearing, Texas lawmakers and flood survivors criticized local officials for a disorganized response to the catastrophic July 4 floods that killed over 130 people. Key emergency officials in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, admitted to being unavailable as the unpredicted floodwaters rose, with the emergency coordinator ill and asleep. Survivors shared harrowing stories of loss, including one woman who lost her parents and daughter, while others called for better warning systems and criticized the lack of governmental aid. The hearing highlighted failures in communication and preparedness.</p>

          <p>The gunman who killed four people in a Manhattan office building reportedly had a valid concealed carry permit from Nevada, despite a documented history of mental health incidents. Law enforcement sources confirmed the shooter, Shane Tamura, obtained the permit in 2022 and legally purchased the handgun used. The AR-15 style rifle was acquired through a private sale from a coworker. The incident highlights the complexities and potential loopholes in state-by-state gun regulations, prompting renewed calls from New York officials for a national assault weapon ban.</p>

          <p>Following a report that Los Angeles has not complied with a 2019 state law, a city councilmember has introduced a motion to compel an analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The law requires local governments to assess the capacity and viability of these routes in disaster-prone areas, but the city's planning department had not made such an analysis public, citing terrorism concerns. The motion specifically calls for an assessment of routes in high-risk areas, considering scenarios like wildfires and tsunamis, and demands a timeline for full compliance with the state mandate.</p>

The new law caps federal loans for professional school at $50,000 per year, leaving a significant funding gap for expensive programs like law and medicine, which can cost much more. This policy may force students to seek private loans with less favorable terms, disproportionately affecting those from working-class backgrounds.

          <p>A recent high-profile meeting between LeBron James, his business partner Maverick Carter, and Nikola Jokić’s agent was reportedly about plans for a new $5 billion international basketball league, not an NBA team-up. The proposed league, inspired by LIV Golf and Formula One, would feature traveling men's and women's teams and offer players equity stakes, a practice currently prohibited for active NBA athletes. This new venture aims to compete on a global scale, even as the NBA pursues its own expansion plans in Europe, setting the stage for a potential rivalry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to revive the presidential fitness test, a physical education program in U.S. schools that was suspended in 2013. The test, which includes activities like a one-mile run and push-ups, was a staple for decades, and its return is part of a broader "make America healthy again" initiative. The program will be administered by the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and will re-establish the president's council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Trump announced the revival alongside several famous athletes, calling it a "wonderful tradition."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has solved a long-standing puzzle about the origin of the potato, revealing that it evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers found that a hybridization event between an ancient tomato and a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile led to the modern potato. The ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form starch-rich tubers. This discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, showcases how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of new traits.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, wearable cooling devices, particularly horseshoe-shaped fans worn around the neck, are gaining popularity as a personal solution to beat the heat. This article explores the effectiveness of these gadgets in providing relief. While they can create a cooling sensation by blowing air across the skin and aiding sweat evaporation, their ability to significantly lower core body temperature is limited. They are best seen as a supplementary comfort measure rather than a primary tool for preventing heat-related illness in extreme conditions. Their utility depends on factors like humidity and personal comfort.</p>
