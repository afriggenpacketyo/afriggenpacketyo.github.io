          <p>Chinese EV manufacturer Nio is planning to produce right-hand-drive vehicles, targeting markets like the UK and Southeast Asia to boost profitability. The company intends to begin production of a right-hand-drive version of its Firefly minicar in October, aiming to compete with brands like BMW's Mini and Mercedes-Benz Smart. Nio's president, Qin Lihong, emphasized the significance of the right-hand-drive market and the company's commitment to global expansion with its Firefly and Onvo brands.

          <p>President Trump's recently announced tariffs have sent shockwaves through the US economy, causing consumer confidence to plummet and triggering panic-buying of goods expected to become more expensive. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index has fallen to levels lower than during the Great Recession, indicating widespread anxiety among Americans. Businesses are also predicting a slowdown in production, suggesting that the tariffs are undermining Trump's goal of reviving American manufacturing.

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating increasing tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of ongoing negotiations regarding tariffs imposed by the U.S. One proposal involves raising the import volume from the United States to approximately 410,000 tons from the current 350,000 tons annually. This consideration arises amidst growing demands in Japan for more affordable imported rice due to surging prices and supply shortages.

Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserts that no government should dictate the curriculum or hiring practices of private universities. The White House maintains that taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard has failed to meet the basic conditions for accessing them.</p>
