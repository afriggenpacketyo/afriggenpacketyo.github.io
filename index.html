          <p>The NATO summit is set to decide on a significant increase in collective defense spending, aiming for 5% of GDP by 2035.

          <p>The UK government's compensation efforts for victims of the Post Office scandal are facing criticism for slow payouts and insufficient action to reach all eligible claimants.  The Public Accounts Committee found that many wrongly accused sub-postmasters remain uncompensated, citing concerns about potential harassment if officials actively pursued them.  The government's response emphasizes concerns about potential claimant harassment, but they have agreed to consult on sending follow-up letters.  The scandal's public inquiry will release its final report on July 8.</p>

          <p>Despite ministerial appeals, a significant number of Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned welfare cuts.  Over 130 MPs, including many from the 2024 intake, have signed the amendment, raising concerns about the impact on disability and sickness benefits.  While the amendment isn't explicitly a confidence vote, it reflects growing internal dissent within the Labour party.

          <p>An initial intelligence assessment suggests that recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months, not years as initially claimed.  The assessment, based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, indicates that while significant damage occurred, the deeply buried enrichment infrastructure remained largely intact.  The White House has rejected this assessment, while Israeli officials claim a multi-year setback.  The conflicting assessments highlight the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the impact of the strikes.</p>
