          <p>China's embassy in Israel has issued a stern rebuke to Israeli lawmaker Toporovsky, condemning his repeated visits to Taiwan and his "erroneous remarks" as actions that severely undermine the political foundation of China-Israel relations. A spokesperson declared Toporovsky's political credibility "completely eroded" and warned of significant consequences if he persists in harming China's core interests and national sentiments. This diplomatic friction underscores Beijing's unwavering commitment to its 'one-China' policy, which considers Taiwan an inseparable part of its territory, and views foreign official interactions with Taiwan as a direct challenge to its sovereignty. The article highlights the escalating diplomatic strain between China and Israel over this contentious issue, emphasizing Beijing's resolve to protect its territorial claims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has approved plans for a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a £2.2 billion privately-financed project designed to boost economic growth. This expansion involves adapting the existing Northern Runway for regular use, aiming to increase annual flights from approximately 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s, thereby creating thousands of jobs and attracting billions in investment. While the government and Labour support the project as a vital economic opportunity, it faces strong opposition from climate campaigners who criticize it as an environmental disaster. The approval includes new conditions for stricter noise controls, enhanced insulation schemes for nearby residents, and targets for increased public transport usage by passengers.</p>

          <p>The recent announcement of a $100,000 H-1B visa fee hike by the U.S. President has generated widespread anxiety among Indian tech professionals and their families, leading to a decline in Indian IT company shares. This article highlights the substantial impact on Indian companies, which may face increased operational costs and adjust staffing strategies by offshoring or hiring locally. Furthermore, analysts predict a potential reduction in remittances to India and a decrease in Indian students pursuing education in the U.S., viewing the new fee as a significant barrier to their career aspirations. The policy could reshape India's tech sector and its relationship with the U.S. labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dominican Republic authorities have successfully recovered 377 packages of cocaine from a speedboat that was destroyed by the U.S. Navy as part of a controversial anti-narcotics mission. The vessel was reportedly carrying 1,000 kilograms of drugs, attempting to use the Dominican Republic as a transit point to the United States. This operation marks a historic joint effort between the two nations against drug trafficking in the Caribbean, aimed at disrupting illicit routes. However, the Trump administration's broader mission, which has involved destroying multiple speedboats and resulted in several deaths, faces strong criticism from human rights groups regarding alleged extrajudicial killings.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has warned Israel against annexing parts of the West Bank following the UK's, Canada's, Australia's, and Portugal's recognition of a Palestinian state. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated the decision aims to "revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution," despite strong condemnation from Israel, which views it as rewarding terrorism. The US also criticized the move. Cooper emphasized that Hamas would have no future role in a demilitarized Palestinian state, framing the recognition as a moral obligation to protect security and peace for both Israelis and Palestinians amid the dire situation in Gaza.</p>

This innovative solution addresses the increasing scarcity and cost of river sand, a critical construction material, by making abundant sea sand viable for use. Sea sand's salt content typically causes corrosion in metal rebar, compromising building integrity, but this new method desalinates it more efficiently, using a 2-to-1 water-to-sand ratio, significantly less than traditional methods. This article highlights the technology's potential to enhance structural integrity, offer economic feasibility for builders, and mitigate the environmental impact associated with river sand extraction.</p>

Parents, like Rachel Cowley, whose daughter Jessica is severely impacted, are actively fighting to raise awareness for this condition, which causes progressive memory loss, movement impairment, and seizures. DRPLA, previously believed to be rare outside Japan, is showing more aggressive symptoms across generations due to gene expansion. Challenges include diagnostic difficulties, the high cost of private testing, and ethical considerations surrounding testing minors for an currently incurable disease, despite some hope from clinical trials.</p>
