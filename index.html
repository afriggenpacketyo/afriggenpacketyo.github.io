            <p>United Airlines presented two profit outlooks for 2025, acknowledging the unpredictability of the current economic climate. The company maintained its initial full-year forecast of $11.50 to $13.50 earnings per share but also offered a recession-adjusted forecast of $7 to $9 per share. CEO Scott Kirby noted that domestic travel demand is weak, leading to a planned 4% reduction in domestic capacity starting in the third quarter, while international bookings remain strong. United's revised strategy reflects the airline's effort to navigate potential economic downturns while maintaining profitability.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to investigate the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported despite having a "withholding of removal" protection order. Van Hollen sought to meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and visit Abrego Garcia, who is being held in a supermax prison. ICE admitted the deportation was an "administrative error" but initially did not take action to return him, alleging Abrego Garcia had MS-13 ties based on a confidential witness and his attire. Van Hollen emphasized that Abrego Garcia's return is about due process and the rule of law.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing parts of an executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, citing potential violations of the First and Fifth Amendments. Judge Loren AliKhan stated the order appeared to be retaliatory against the firm for representing Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News. Donald Verrilli, representing Susman Godfrey, called the order an unconstitutional abuse of executive power, noting that other firms have made deals with the White House to avoid similar targeting. This ruling marks the fourth time a law firm has successfully challenged similar executive orders signed by Mr. Trump.</p>

            <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has lost his appeal against an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court. The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence, citing the meticulous approach of the original judge in applying the law and determining the appropriate sanction. Yaxley-Lennon was jailed for breaching a court order related to a libel trial in 2021, where he wrongly claimed a Syrian teenager was a violent thug. The court also considered Yaxley-Lennon's complaints about his treatment in prison but found no reasonable basis to reduce his sentence.</p>

            <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai's approval ratings have decreased, according to recent polls, amid rising tensions with mainland China and a recall campaign targeting opposition lawmakers. A poll by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that 45.9% of respondents approved of Lai's job performance, while 45.7% disapproved, marking his second-lowest rating since taking office. Another poll by mnews indicated that 37.8% of voters expressed dissatisfaction with Lai's performance. The polling occurred as Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supports a recall campaign to unseat lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to regain control of the legislature.</p>

The cases involved Isaiah Haastrup and Zainab Abbasi, both of whom were subjects of life support treatment disputes at the High Court. The court emphasized that the need for restricting freedom of speech must be convincingly established, which the NHS trusts failed to do. The ruling allows the parents to share their experiences and ensures transparency in the treatment of patients in public hospitals.</p>

            <p>Canada's Conservative party, led by Pierre Poilievre, is facing a potential catastrophic loss in the upcoming federal election due to Donald Trump's tariffs and threats to annex Canada. Poilievre's populist messaging had initially gained traction, but recent polling shifts have placed the Liberals in the lead. Poilievre's confrontational style and focus on the cost-of-living crisis have alienated female voters and prompted left-leaning voters to support Liberal opponent Mark Carney. The Conservative party is now facing internal recriminations as it struggles to regain momentum before the election.</p>

The doctor, part of a nursing service's end-of-life care team, is accused of administering anesthetics and muscle relaxants without the patients' knowledge or consent, leading to respiratory arrest. Prosecutors said the suspect had no motive beyond killing and aim to ensure he wouldn't be eligible for release after 15 years and to ban him from his profession for life.

The game, involving the transfer of "germs" between children, reflects anxieties about illness, hygiene, and gender relations. Originating from a British colonial term for lice, the game became popular during the polio epidemic in the 1950s and the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. The author notes the irony of children engaging in vaccination satire while the Health and Human Services secretary undermines vaccine efficacy, highlighting the importance of cherishing medical wisdom.</p>

            <p>Three protesters were arrested, two of whom were tased, for disrupting Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's town hall in Georgia. Greene accused the media of defending an "illegal alien" member of MS-13 who was deported to El Salvador, referring to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite his legal status. Greene's remarks and the police response to the protesters sparked controversy. Outside the venue, additional protesters lined up on the street, exercising their First Amendment rights.</p>

            <h2>UK Inflation Rate Falls, But Expected to Rise Again Soon</h2>

            <p>The UK inflation rate has eased for the second consecutive month, reaching 2.6% in March, driven by falling petrol and toy prices, and unchanged food prices. However, analysts predict this is a temporary lull, as household bills and costs rose in April, including utilities, council tax, and phone and broadband contracts. The impact of Donald Trump's tariff policies and the performance of the UK economy also add uncertainty. While the tariff on UK goods is lower than feared, the possibility of cheap Chinese products entering the UK could slow inflation, but economic growth and Bank of England policies remain critical factors.</p>

            <p>The diplomatic row between France and Algeria has escalated with both countries expelling diplomats. France recalled its ambassador and ordered 12 Algerian diplomats to leave Paris after Algeria expelled 12 French officials due to the arrest of a consular staff member over the kidnapping of a government critic. Tensions have been rising for months, with disagreements over French recognition of Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and the jailing of French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal. Despite attempts to ease tensions, underlying issues persist, leading to further deterioration in relations.</p>

Harvard's decision reflects a broader conflict between the federal government and higher education institutions, particularly regarding campus protests and accusations of antisemitism.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a lawsuit challenging President Trump's authority to enact international tariffs without congressional approval. The legal action argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose tariffs. California, which engaged in nearly $675 billion in two-way trade last year, stands to lose billions in state revenue under Trump's tariff policies. The lawsuit seeks to void Trump's tariff orders, potentially requiring Congress to vote on the tariffs and placing Republican lawmakers in a politically vulnerable position.</p>

            <p>Experts warn that the Trump administration's promotion of white Christian nationalists to key government roles could lead to the dismantling of government institutions and the chilling of free speech. The creation of an "anti-Christian bias" taskforce and a White House Faith Office, dominated by right-wing Christian loyalists, has prompted concerns about prioritizing a specific brand of Christianity over other faiths. Appointees like Paula White and Jennifer Korn reflect a narrow slice of conservative Protestantism, potentially influencing policy beyond social issues. Concerns are also raised about figures involved in Project 2025, who now hold positions in Trump's government.</p>
