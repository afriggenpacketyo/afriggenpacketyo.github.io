          <p>A Republican senator has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill," suggesting the presence of sufficient resistance within the Senate to potentially obstruct its advancement without substantial modifications. The senator emphasized the necessity of prioritizing deficit reduction, highlighting the bill's current trajectory of increasing rather than decreasing the deficit. This resistance underscores the challenges in securing bipartisan support for the sweeping domestic policy package, particularly given the narrow Republican majority in the Senate and concerns about its economic impact. The speaker is hopeful the Senate will pass it without too many changes, but the senator disagrees.</p>

          <p>Six months following President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party is still grappling with the aftermath, facing historically low approval ratings and a sense of cultural rejection. The article highlights the party's struggle to reconnect with voters, particularly in communities they once relied upon, as working-class voters increasingly align with the Republican Party. Democratic leaders are reassessing their messaging and policies, engaging in fierce debates over immigration, transgender rights, and economic populism. The article notes the structural challenges Democrats face, including a Senate map tilted to the right and an Electoral College favoring red states, while donors explore new strategies to win back working-class voters.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Nice, France, affecting approximately 45,000 households, following damage to an electrical facility suspected to be caused by arson. The incident occurred a day after a similar outage disrupted the Cannes Film Festival, leading authorities to suspect malicious acts. The blackout in Nice halted tram services and briefly impacted Nice Côte d'Azur Airport, but power was fully restored within a few hours. Police have launched a criminal investigation into the incident, exploring potential links to the Cannes outage and a separate act of sabotage on a high-voltage power line near Cannes.</p>

The Red Cross reported the deaths of two of its staff in a separate strike, underscoring the dangers faced by civilians and aid workers in the region. The Israeli military stated that the incident is under review, claiming the area was a "dangerous war zone" and civilians were urged to evacuate. The UN reports that a significant portion of Gaza is now subject to Israeli evacuation orders or located in militarized zones, with the conflict resulting in thousands of Palestinian fatalities since the resumption of hostilities in March.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa intends to file a formal complaint with the Premier League following a controversial refereeing decision during their 2-0 defeat against Manchester United, a loss that ultimately cost them a Champions League spot. A goal by Morgan Rogers was disallowed due to referee Thomas Bramall's perceived foul on the United goalkeeper, a decision Villa argues was a "big mistake." The club is particularly upset about the selection of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial match, questioning why more seasoned officials were not assigned. Villa's director of football stated the complaint is not about the decision itself, but the selection of the referee.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Supreme Court order has effectively allowed President Trump to remove high-level officials who normally retain their positions regardless of the president, raising concerns about the consolidation of power within the executive branch. The court's decision, made in a case involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent central to the structure of the federal government. The author argues that this decision risks assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law, emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional norms. The author expresses concern that the court's actions may undermine lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Ketamine therapy is gaining traction as an alternative treatment for depression, particularly treatment-resistant depression, with some reality stars touting its benefits for relationships. While a derivative of ketamine has been FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation, experts caution about potential risks, including adverse health issues and addiction. The drug is believed to create more connections between brain cells, potentially easing depression and suicidal thoughts, but should be administered under medical supervision. Experts emphasize that ketamine therapy should be seen as a step toward healing rather than a quick fix, and that its use should be carefully monitored by medical professionals.</p>

McCain criticized Israel's blockade, stating it has created a catastrophe for the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza and pushed back on claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, attributing it to the desperation of starving people. She emphasized the urgent need for scaled-up aid deliveries to prevent famine and called for international pressure to ensure consistent access to those in need. The blockade has been in place for 2 1/2 months before a small number of aid trucks were allowed to enter.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and potential deportation.

The case has also highlighted the role of local law enforcement in immigration enforcement, with the Whitfield county sheriff's office having a 287(g) contract with Ice. The teenager has since been released on bond, and her attorney is working to secure her permanent residency.</p>

          <p>The broadcast of "Face the Nation" on Memorial Day covered a range of topics, including President Trump's spending bill, the situation in Ukraine, and humanitarian aid to Gaza. Speaker Mike Johnson defended the bill as an investment in the U.S. economy, while Representative Jim Himes criticized it for failing to address the deficit and providing tax relief to the wealthiest Americans. Cindy McCain, head of the U.N.'s World Food Program, described the aid reaching Gaza as insufficient, while Navy veteran Jack McCain spoke about the need to support Afghan pilots who worked with the U.S. military. The show also featured veterans serving in Congress discussing public service and honoring those who have protected the nation.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuel projects, Japan remains a major public financier of gas and oil production, particularly in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. This investment contradicts Japan's role as a leader in promoting a fossil fuel phase-out in Asia through initiatives like the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC). Critics argue that Japan's reliance on LNG as a "transitional fuel" and its investment in carbon capture storage (CCS) technology constitute "greenwashing." The article points to Indonesia as an example, where Japan's involvement in energy planning may hinder the country's transition to renewable energy.</p>

          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, aiming to build emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Unlike other approaches, it prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents, encouraging them to accept their child's emotions without dismissing them. The method sees misbehavior as a signal for support, setting boundaries with empathy rather than control, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair after conflicts. The article advocates for parents to reflect on their own childhood experiences and triggers to create a steady, safe space for their children during emotional storms.</p>

While some celebrate the progress made in addressing systemic racism and police brutality, others express concern that the initial momentum for change is waning. President Trump has begun to roll back police reforms in Minneapolis and other cities, which makes the anniversary more bittersweet.</p>
