Her debut was celebrated by supporters and praised by team managers for her professionalism and clear knowledge of the game. Following the historic event, Pawol donated the cap she wore during the game to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, marking a significant milestone for women in professional sports.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military operation in Gaza City, stating it is essential to defeat the remaining Hamas strongholds and end the war. He asserted that the goal is to demilitarize the enclave and install a non-Israeli civilian administration, not to occupy Gaza. The plan, which has drawn international condemnation over humanitarian concerns, involves moving civilians to designated safe zones. The announcement came as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting and reports emerged of an Israeli strike that killed several Al Jazeera journalists in the area.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 5-4 to the Toronto Blue Jays after their bullpen gave up three solo home runs in the final innings, squandering a lead. Starter Tyler Glasnow delivered another strong performance, but relievers Blake Treinen and Alex Vesia could not secure the win. Despite strong offensive contributions, including a home run from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers struggled with runners in scoring position, leaving the bases loaded in both the eighth and ninth innings.

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner addressed a critical comment on her social media after she was judged for attending an Oasis concert without her children. When a user suggested she had forgotten she was a mother, Turner replied by explaining the concept of shared custody, stating her children were likely with their father, her ex-husband Joe Jonas. Her response garnered significant support from fans, who praised her for pushing back against the double standard often applied to mothers.

          <p>A 25-year-old man from New York, identified as Kevin Mares, was fatally shot in the La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mares was visiting the island with friends to attend one of Bad Bunny's concerts and was an innocent bystander in an argument that escalated to gunfire, which also injured two local men. The incident occurred at a nightspot and has renewed concerns about tourist safety in La Perla, a historically troubled area that had seen improvements in recent years. This marks another violent incident involving tourists in the community this year.</p>

          <p>According to a Financial Times report, Nvidia and AMD have entered an unprecedented agreement to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China. This arrangement was reportedly a condition for obtaining export licenses for Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips, which were recently granted. The move is seen as a novel approach to navigating strict U.S. export controls on advanced technology to China, though it is unclear how the government intends to use the funds.

          <p>A coalition of European leaders, including those from the UK, France, and Germany, issued a joint statement affirming that a lasting peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. This came in response to a planned bilateral meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which currently does not include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While welcoming U.S. efforts to end the conflict, the European nations stressed that Ukraine must have the freedom to choose its own destiny. The White House has indicated it remains open to a joint meeting with all three leaders.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour title in over two years by winning the St Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole play-off against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a play-off at this year's Masters, held his nerve to claim victory in Memphis. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with a lead but finished one shot behind, continuing his long wait for a first PGA Tour victory despite a successful career. Rose's victory marks a significant return to form for the 45-year-old.</p>

The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to recruit more proactively based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move as a source of hope for students, NHS employer representatives raised concerns about how the changes would be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

While his passing statistics were modest, his performance on the ground, with 48 rushing yards, has seemingly narrowed the gap with veteran Taylor Heinicke. The game also highlighted promising plays from the Chargers' defense and special teams, providing key insights into the team's depth ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded the immediate removal of homeless people from Washington, D.C., suggesting they be relocated to facilities "FAR from the Capital." In a series of social media posts, he also floated the idea of putting the city under federal control and increasing the presence of federal law enforcement to combat what he calls rampant crime. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, noting that official data shows violent crime in the city has been declining and is at a 30-year low, making the president's claims of a crime spike false.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Community Shield match against Crystal Palace, which ended in a 2-2 draw and a penalty shootout loss, offered a first look at Arne Slot's revamped team. Four new signings started, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, who was a standout performer in a more advanced midfield role. The team showed flashes of offensive brilliance, with two debutants scoring, but also displayed significant defensive vulnerabilities that led to them twice surrendering a lead. The performance suggests that while the new-look squad has high potential, it will require time to adapt and fix its defensive bugs.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly pushed back against allegations from Chinese state-affiliated media that its H20 artificial intelligence chips represent a national security risk for China. An article had claimed the chips could be remotely shut down through a hardware "backdoor," a feature often called a "kill switch." In response, an Nvidia spokesperson stated that the company does not have backdoors in its chips that would allow remote access or control. This dispute occurs amid escalating U.S.-China tensions over semiconductor export controls, even as Nvidia has resumed sales of the H20 chip to the Chinese market.</p>
