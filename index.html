          <p>A gunman shot and killed two women, aged 72 and 32, at a church in Lexington, Kentucky, after earlier shooting and wounding a state trooper. The suspect, identified as Guy House, was reportedly looking for his ex-partner at the church and allegedly had a history of mental health issues and drug use. Two other individuals were also wounded in the church shooting before police arrived and fatally shot the suspect. The incident has been described as a "senseless act of violence" that has shocked the local community.</p>

          <p>A severe fire at the Gabriel House assisted-living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of at least nine residents and injuries to more than 30 others. Firefighters arrived to a chaotic scene with residents trapped in the three-story building, requiring numerous ladder rescues. While the fire was contained to one wing, heavy smoke spread throughout the structure, which officials noted is often more deadly than the flames themselves. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and the incident has been labeled an "unfathomable tragedy."</p>

          <p>Rescue and recovery efforts are ongoing in Texas following catastrophic flooding, with the death toll currently at 130. Heavy rains on Sunday hampered search operations in Kerr County, where officials are still looking for missing individuals. A model indicated that water in one community reached 36 feet, moving at 1.5 million gallons per second, highlighting the disaster's immense scale. While a flood watch remains in effect, forecasters anticipate a period of dry weather to begin later in the week, which may aid the ongoing search.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the formation of an independent commission to investigate serious allegations of organized crime infiltrating the nation's law enforcement. The move follows public claims by a high-ranking police commissioner that Police Minister Senzo Mchunu has links to a corruption suspect. In response, Ramaphosa has placed the minister on a leave of absence, stating the commission will deliver initial findings within three months. Critics, however, argue the president is outsourcing responsibility and avoiding decisive action on the issue of endemic government corruption.</p>

          <p>Following Morgan Stanley's downgrade of CrowdStrike to "equal weight," CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed a bullish counter-opinion, viewing the subsequent dip as a buying opportunity. Morgan Stanley cited the cybersecurity firm's high valuation after a 50% stock rise since April, suggesting its growth potential is already priced in. Cramer, however, remains confident in the company's strong second-half outlook, particularly as customer deals made after a 2024 IT glitch expire. The article notes that while concerns over valuation and potential federal budget cuts exist, many investors still see CrowdStrike as a long-term leader. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed sanctions would target key trade partners like China and India, which have been crucial in absorbing Russian oil exports and providing vital imports.

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has theorized that President Trump's tariff policies have not caused significant price inflation because of a rise in "patriotism" among American consumers.

This explanation was met with skepticism from other economists, who point to factors like importers stockpiling goods and countries absorbing tariff costs as more likely reasons. Critics also note that many of Trump's most significant tariff plans have been temporarily delayed, muting their immediate price effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Reinstated Tax Break for Private Jets Expected to Stimulate Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 12:21:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new federal spending bill is anticipated to boost the private jet market by reinstating "bonus depreciation," allowing businesses to write off 100% of a jet's purchase price in the first year. This tax incentive, which applies to new and used jets placed in service for business use, is reviving a provision from the 2017 tax cuts. Jet brokers report a surge in interest from clients who were waiting for the legislation to pass. The stimulus comes as the private jet industry has seen growth slow from its post-pandemic peak, with a rising inventory of pre-owned jets on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of current certificate of deposit (CD) rates reveals that while short-term CDs currently offer higher annual percentage yields (APYs), long-term CDs generate substantially more total interest over their full term. For a $5,000 deposit, a 5-year CD at 4.20% would earn over $1,140, whereas a 1-year CD at a higher rate of 4.40% earns $220. The unusual rate inversion is attributed to banks hedging against potential Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. The choice between them depends on a saver's goals: maximizing total returns versus maintaining flexibility to reinvest sooner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari leaves behind a complex and debated legacy following his death. Supporters remember him for his anti-corruption stance and belief in a unified Nigeria, while critics point to his autocratic tendencies and a flawed leadership style that earned him the nickname "Baba Go Slow." His tenure was marked by economic struggles, including a recession and falling oil production, and his government's violent crackdown on the #EndSARS protests in 2020 remains a source of deep anger. Ultimately, his time in power, both as a military ruler and a democratically-elected president, is viewed as a period of both praise and pain.</p>

The author recounts frustrating experiences where AI assistants fail to understand simple, context-rich commands, such as getting directions or finding files on a personal computer. The piece suggests that while generative AI can synthesize vast amounts of internet data, it has made little progress in creating a seamless, intuitive interface for managing one's own digital life.
