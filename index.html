          <p>British pharmaceutical giant GSK announced a substantial commitment to invest at least $30 billion in U.S. research, development, and manufacturing over the next five years. This significant pledge includes $1.2 billion earmarked for advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and cutting-edge digital technologies to establish next-generation biopharma factories and laboratories across the United States. The timing of this major investment coincides with President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K., underscoring the deep economic and scientific relationship between the two countries. GSK's CEO, Emma Walmsley, highlighted the company's pride in contributing to both nations' leadership in healthcare innovation and strengthening its existing R&D and supply chain within the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's Yiwu "International Trade Market," a major wholesale hub, is reportedly pivoting its customer base away from the U.S. amid ongoing trade tensions. While some sellers downplay the impact of tariffs, observations suggest a clear shift towards Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and Latin American buyers, with Arabic signs becoming more prevalent. Exports from Yiwu to the U.S. have declined significantly, mirroring a national trend, as Chinese suppliers seek more stable, albeit slower-growing, non-U.S. markets. This strategic reorientation highlights the enduring effects of the U.S.-China trade war on local economies.</p>

          <p>An international cybercrime group, Qilin, has claimed responsibility for a ransomware attack on the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, holding parts of its computer system hostage. The breach, which occurred three weeks prior, affected the "DocketMaster" system, crucial for managing inmate transfers and releases. While the office assures that no jail security operations are impacted, the outage caused delays in inmate releases, frustrating families. Authorities are refusing to pay the ransom, and are implementing manual workarounds while cybersecurity specialists investigate the malware attack.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz stated that hate speech is "absolutely" protected by the First Amendment, asserting that individuals cannot be prosecuted for speech, even if it is "evil and bigoted." His comments followed the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, prompting a debate on free speech limits. Cruz argued that those who celebrate Kirk's murder should face consequences like termination or expulsion, but not prosecution, contrasting with Attorney General Pam Bondi's initial remarks about targeting hate speech that she later clarified to include only threats of violence. This article highlights the ongoing tension between free speech principles and calls for accountability for divisive rhetoric.</p>

          <p>China's offshore yuan has strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar, surpassing 7.1 for the first time in nearly a year, as the Federal Reserve's anticipated interest rate cut approaches.

Economists predict that the Fed's easing will further depreciate the U.S. dollar, contributing to the yuan's stability and strength.

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, announced his resignation from the ice cream company, expressing a "broken heart" over the perceived loss of the brand's social mission independence under owner Unilever. Greenfield and co-founder Ben Cohen had previously called for Ben & Jerry's to become independent again, especially as Unilever plans to spin off its ice cream division, Magnum. Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry's in 2000 with an agreement for significant autonomy, allowing it to pursue its social corporate mission, which Greenfield now feels is compromised.

          <p>An opinion article warns that the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk could be exploited by Donald Trump, potentially becoming a "Reichstag fire" moment to consolidate power and suppress dissent. The author argues that Trump immediately blamed the "radical left" without evidence and expressed indifference to national healing, accelerating polarization. The article highlights historical parallels to 1933 Germany and expresses fear of intensified repression against perceived enemies, despite unclear motives behind the shooting. This piece underscores concerns about the weaponization of political violence in a highly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>China's large reusable Tianlong-3 rocket has successfully passed a critical "major exam," involving a 35-second burn of nine Tianhuo-12 engines that generated nearly 1,000 tonnes of thrust. This achievement marks a significant milestone in the rocket's development, described as the "most complex and challenging ground trial." Space Pioneer, the company behind the rocket, announced that Tianlong-3 is now in the final sprint towards its inaugural launch, aiming for a flight by the end of this year. The company plans to quickly scale up to over 30 commercial missions annually, advancing China's capabilities in reusable space technology.</p>

          <p>A report by Global Witness reveals that at least 142 environmental advocates were killed worldwide in 2024, with four more missing, predominantly indigenous people and farmers. Most victims were targeted for opposing mining, logging, agriculture, poaching, and energy projects, with criminal groups being the primary perpetrators, though state security forces were also involved. Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico were identified as the most dangerous countries, with over 80% of the deaths occurring in Latin America. While the global death toll decreased slightly from 2023, the organization stresses governments' responsibility to protect these defenders and prosecute attackers.</p>
