          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to negotiate the return of Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia during his upcoming meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. He characterized the summit as a "feel-out meeting" to gauge if a deal is possible, stating he would know within minutes of meeting Putin. Trump mentioned he would update European allies and speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before and after the talks.

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon is on a national tour to advocate for the Trump administration's plan to dissolve the Department of Education and return control to individual states. The tour began in Louisiana, a state praised for its post-pandemic improvements in elementary literacy, which McMahon presents as evidence of state-level success. Critics argue that abolishing the department, which requires congressional approval, would create chaos for programs like federal student loans and special education grants. McMahon dismisses funding concerns, stating that congressionally appropriated funds would simply flow through a different agency.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars from Switzerland and other countries. The initial ruling caused gold futures to hit a record high, but prices fell after Trump's declaration on Truth Social. The tariffs would have impacted 1 kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars used to back COMEX futures contracts.

          <p>After pausing its initial public offering plans in April due to market volatility from tariff concerns, ticketing company StubHub is now targeting a September IPO. The company, which updated its prospectus, reported a 10% revenue growth in the first quarter to $397.6 million, though its net loss widened. The move comes as the IPO market shows renewed signs of life after a prolonged quiet period. StubHub, acquired by co-founder Eric Baker's company Viagogo in 2020, faces stiff competition from rivals like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study of a major earthquake in Myanmar on a fault similar to the San Andreas suggests the next "Big One" in California may not resemble past events. The research, coauthored by Caltech scientists, found that the recent magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar ruptured a much longer section of fault than expected, crossing areas that had ruptured more recently. This implies that earthquakes do not follow repeatable patterns, and future seismic events on the San Andreas could be smaller and more frequent or a single, much larger rupture exceeding magnitude 8.

The company posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, a 35% increase year-over-year, and significantly narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million from $32.8 million a year prior. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive results to a recovering box office, growth in premium offerings, and increased attendance. The company has also successfully addressed its 2026 debt maturities, pushing them to 2029 and strengthening its financial foundation for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's move to place the Washington, D.C. police under federal control invokes a specific provision, Section 740, of the D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973. While the Act grants D.C. an elected mayor and council, it retains significant federal oversight, including congressional review of all laws and presidential appointment of judges. Section 740 specifically allows the president to take control of the city's police force for up to 30 days in an emergency, an action which can only be extended by Congress. D.C. officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the move as an assault on local autonomy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 16:04:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2019 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause is a primary driver of the current crisis over partisan gerrymandering. The ruling declared that challenges to partisan gerrymandering were a "political question" beyond the reach of federal courts, effectively enabling state legislatures to rig elections without federal judicial oversight. The author contends this opened the door for actions like the current push in Texas to redraw districts for partisan gain, forcing other states to consider similar tactics in response. The article concludes that the Supreme Court is to blame for the erosion of democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly defended Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following President Trump's call for his resignation. In a Financial Times article, Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, described Trump's attack as a "vindictive political sideshow" without modern precedent. He praised Tan's past success in turning around Cadence Design Systems and called on Intel's board to show "backbone" by not capitulating to political pressure. The defense came as Tan visited the White House to address concerns over his ties to China, after which Trump reversed his stance.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed five Al Jazeera journalists, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif, has drawn widespread condemnation from the United Nations, the European Union, and Germany. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation, noting that over 240 journalists have been killed in the conflict. Israel claimed it targeted Sharif, alleging he headed a Hamas cell, an accusation Al Jazeera and media rights groups reject. The incident has intensified calls for the protection of journalists in war zones and has been described as an unacceptable breach of international law.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the growing trend of mandating identity verification and facial recognition for online services is creating a "facial-recognition sham." Using the example of the "Tea Dating Advice" app, which was easily fooled despite its security claims, the author contends these systems are often insecure and ineffective. The article criticizes new laws in the U.K. and U.S. states that require age verification for online content, stating they dissolve anonymity and create new privacy risks without effectively protecting users. The author suggests such measures sacrifice privacy for a flawed and easily circumvented idea of safety.</p>

          <p>A new research note from Melius Research downgrading Adobe has raised concerns about the broader software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry, including major players like Salesforce. The analysis posits that AI is disrupting the software world much like cloud computing disrupted on-premise data centers, as AI tools may reduce the need for expensive, seat-based software licenses. While Salesforce is also investing heavily in its own AI capabilities, the market is showing concern over the potential threat to its core business model. This has prompted a re-evaluation of Salesforce's stock amid the shifting technological landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global transition to clean energy could be hampered by significant shortages of up to 12 critical minerals by 2100, according to a new comprehensive study in Nature Climate Change. Technologies like batteries and solar panels depend on minerals such as lithium and cobalt, and current supplies may not meet future demand. However, the article notes that fears of "peak mineral" may be premature, as rapid technological innovation is already creating substitutes and reducing the need for certain scarce materials. The dynamic nature of the industry makes long-term predictions difficult, but it underscores the complex supply chain challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>A Romanian man, Catalin-Marius Graur, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in a large-scale fraud scheme that stole food and cash aid from thousands of low-income Californians. Graur used sophisticated skimming devices on ATMs to steal Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card information, which was then used to create fraudulent cards and drain funds. At the time of his arrest, he possessed nearly 1,500 stolen account numbers and over $37,000 in cash.

This action comes despite local police data showing that violent crime in D.C. has fallen dramatically and is at a 30-year low. D.C.
