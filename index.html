          <p>Equinor will resume construction on its Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm in New York after the Trump administration lifted a stop-work order. The Interior Department initially halted the project due to concerns about insufficient analysis, but the decision was reversed following discussions with Equinor and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. The project, which aims to deliver electricity directly to New York City, is expected to begin commercial operations in 2027 and supports 1,500 union jobs. The approval followed what appears to be a compromise regarding a gas pipeline project with the state.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world's largest electric car battery maker, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were blocked from participating due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. This exclusion underscores the deepening financial rift between the two nations, with CATL caught in the crossfire of sanctions and tariffs. The company has been labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, and U.S. lawmakers have pressured Wall Street banks to withdraw from the listing. CATL's move to exclude U.S. investors reflects concerns about geopolitical risks, signaling a potential trend of broader financial decoupling.</p>

Conservatives seek steeper spending cuts and earlier Medicaid work requirements, while moderates oppose cuts to Medicaid and demand a higher state and local tax deduction cap. The bill, estimated to add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, requires near-unanimous Republican support to pass the House. Trump urged Republicans to back the bill, suggesting any Republican who doesn't back the bill would be "knocked out so fast."</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax and spending bill is facing opposition from Republican dissidents, creating four main sticking points: the amount of spending cuts, changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, and food assistance. Four right-wing lawmakers argue that the cuts should be steeper to avoid increasing the national debt, while others oppose cuts to Medicaid. Some lawmakers from high-tax states object to the proposed cap on local tax deductions, and there is also debate over work requirements for Medicaid recipients.

Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief to do so, but the SEC has been hesitant due to concerns about the tax implications of co-mingling the funds. One risk is that ETF shareclass holders may end up subsidizing the mutual fund class holders.

          <p>A Republican plan to tax university endowments, designed to target "woke, elite universities," could also affect smaller schools like McPherson College in Kansas. The proposal aims to hold accountable schools that Republicans believe operate more like corporations, with a tiered tax system based on endowment size and enrollment. While the highest rate would hit institutions like Harvard and Yale, smaller schools could also face significant tax burdens. Critics argue that the tax would harm universities' ability to fund financial aid for students, potentially shifting the cost of tuition onto families.</p>

          <p>Home Depot announced it will maintain current pricing levels, contrasting with Walmart's warning of price hikes due to tariffs. The home improvement retailer is working with suppliers to hold prices steady and is shifting production out of China to avoid tariffs. More than half of Home Depot's goods are domestically produced, and the company aims to further reduce reliance on China. This decision follows President Trump's criticism of Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases, with Trump asserting that Walmart should "eat the tariffs."</p>

          <p>President Trump faces a significant challenge in securing Republican support for his "big, beautiful bill" before the Memorial Day recess. With House Republicans only able to lose three votes, outstanding issues remain on state and local tax deductions, Medicaid work requirements, and overall spending. The House Rules Committee convened at 1 a.m. ET to prepare the package for the floor, but it is doubtful the bill has the votes to pass right now. Trump is expected to meet with Republicans for about an hour and a half this morning to persuade Republicans to back it.</p>

          <p>President Trump appears to be stepping back from trying to end the war in Ukraine, prompting mixed reactions from Ukrainians. While many Ukrainians express exhaustion and a desire for peace, they also demonstrate a resolve to continue fighting despite the lack of progress in negotiations. Trump's call with Putin did not appear to yield any concessions from Russia, leading some Ukrainians to view the diplomatic efforts as a "theatrical performance." Ukrainians express a need to rely on themselves and find support from allies as they continue to defend their country.</p>

          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has prompted questions about the stability of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power. Some have suggested that Spain's high reliance on renewables was at fault, but the country's grid operator and prime minister have disputed this. Experts suggest the blackout highlights grid stability issues more than problems with renewable energy sources. They also recommend investing in better battery storage, increasing grid flexibility, and improving connections to neighboring countries to enhance grid stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's desire for a new Air Force One led to a proposed deal with Qatar for a luxury Boeing 747-8, which the country had been trying to sell for years.

Qatar denies any intention of using the transaction as part of an influence campaign, and the arrangement is under scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
