          <h2>Speculation Arises Over Strained Relationship Between Trump and Netanyahu Amid Gaza Conflict</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 09:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing speculation that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu's relationship has soured due to disagreements over the handling of the Gaza conflict. Trump's recent Middle East tour, which notably excluded Israel, and his direct negotiations with Hamas for the release of an American-Israeli hostage, have fueled these speculations. Israeli commentators suggest Trump is displeased with Netanyahu's perceived manipulations regarding Iran and Gaza, particularly Netanyahu's violation of a ceasefire agreement. While some analysts believe Trump is sidelining Netanyahu to reshape the Middle East, others suggest Trump's transactional foreign policy requires Netanyahu to deliver on a ceasefire in Gaza and a less belligerent stance on Iran, conditions the prime minister is unlikely to meet due to domestic political constraints. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Direct peace negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators took place in Istanbul, marking the first talks since early 2022, though they concluded after a short duration. Despite low expectations, even from President Trump, the meeting was viewed as a tactical success for President Putin, who initiated talks without agreeing to a ceasefire, a condition sought by Ukraine and its Western allies. The negotiations followed days of posturing, with both Putin and Zelensky appearing to respond to Washington's call for direct talks. However, Trump later undermined the discussions, stating that meaningful progress would only occur after a personal meeting with Putin, leading to concerns in Ukraine that Trump might negotiate their country's fate behind closed doors with Russia. </p>

          <p>MPs have approved changes to a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek assistance in ending their lives, including provisions that allow health workers to opt out of participating in the process.

The bill has undergone several changes since its initial passing, including the removal of the need for a High Court judge to approve each request, and faces a Commons vote on whether to proceed to the next stage. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates a widening gap between earnings and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living for most Americans. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finds that the bottom 60% of U.S. households cannot afford a "minimal quality of life," considering factors beyond basic necessities, such as technology, education, and healthcare. The report also suggests that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a "functionally unemployed" rate topping 24% when factoring in poverty-wage jobs and those unable to find full-time work. From 2001 to 2023, the cost of basic economic security doubled, while median earnings for the bottom 60% fell, highlighting a growing disparity. </p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary, marking the longest period any reluctant defectors have been held. Despite their repeated requests to return home, Pyongyang is refusing to communicate with Seoul, reflecting strained relations between the two countries. Analysts suggest North Korea's silence is a sign of displeasure with South Korea's conservative government and its closer ties with the U.S. and Japan. The fishermen's fate remains uncertain, pending improved relations or a change in their desire to return, highlighting the deep political divide and communication breakdown between the two Koreas. </p>

The deduction would be available to those 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes over $150,000.

          <p>A research team in China has utilized DeepSeek AI to generate military simulation scenarios, significantly reducing the time required for commanders to plan battles. The AI system can produce 10,000 scenarios in just 48 seconds, compared to the 48 hours previously needed for manual planning. The AI's ability to deconstruct and reconstruct complex battlefield situations through massive data sets is seen as a disruptive change in military decision-making. This advancement highlights the increasing role of AI in modern warfare and strategic planning. </p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike after failing to reach an agreement on pay raises, resulting in a complete shutdown of rail service and impacting hundreds of thousands of daily commuters. The union, representing about 460 engineers, cites disparities in pay compared to competitors and the rising cost of living. Negotiations have been ongoing for five years, with the union stating that NJ Transit could have avoided the strike. The agency has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service, but it can only accommodate a fraction of daily train riders. </p>

          <p>In far northern California, a region with strong support for Donald Trump, voters are expressing concern over the rapid pace and scale of cuts enacted by the Trump administration. Despite backing Trump's agenda, including a smaller federal government, residents are worried about the impact of layoffs and reductions to essential services like healthcare and emergency preparedness. While support for Trump remains strong among Republicans, the unease highlights the potential harm to rural communities that rely on federal support. The situation underscores the challenges of balancing fiscal conservatism with the needs of communities dependent on government assistance. </p>

Novogratz said the process, which should have taken a few months, stretched out to several years and cost over $25 million. Despite the challenges, Galaxy Digital is now trading on U.S. public markets, with Novogratz ringing the opening bell at the Nasdaq.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Achieving a 100% "Made in the USA" vehicle is currently infeasible due to the complexities of the global automotive supply chain, according to industry experts. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase domestic sourcing through tariffs, the cost of reshoring all auto parts manufacturing would be substantial. Many parts are cheaper to produce overseas, and establishing new processing and production plants in the U.S. would take a decade or more. Ford CEO Jim Farley notes that sourcing 15% to 20% of commoditized parts domestically is currently difficult or impossible, and a 100% U.S.-made vehicle could price many consumers out of the market. </p>

          <p>A recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that 25 percent of unresponsive brain-injury patients exhibit signs of awareness based on brain activity. This finding suggests that thousands of individuals previously thought to be in a vegetative state may retain cognitive function, living in profound isolation. The article shares the story of Ian Berg, who suffered a severe brain injury in 1986 and was initially diagnosed as vegetative, but later found to be minimally conscious. Researchers are exploring new tools and technologies, such as brain implants, to help unlock communication and improve the quality of life for these patients. </p>

However, the article also points out that short-term CDs often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve.
