          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, following a recent phone call between the two leaders. To increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a possibility Trump may use as leverage in discussions. This diplomatic push comes after Trump claimed success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza, shifting his foreign policy focus to the nearly four-year-long conflict in Ukraine. The Kremlin has expressed openness to dialogue but warned that providing Tomahawks to Kyiv would represent a "serious escalation."</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has ruled that the BBC committed a "serious breach" of broadcasting rules with its documentary "Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone." The program was found to be "materially misleading" for failing to disclose that its narrator was the son of a Hamas official, a group proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK. Ofcom has ordered the BBC to broadcast a prime-time statement about its findings, marking the first such sanction against the broadcaster since 2009. The BBC has accepted the ruling and apologized for the significant failing in accuracy.</p>

          <p>The Portland City Council has unanimously voted to legally codify its sanctuary city status, implementing new measures to further limit cooperation between local police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The "Protect Portland Initiative" makes the city's sanctuary policies legally binding and prohibits city employees from assisting federal agencies with immigration enforcement. This move establishes a formal framework for resisting federal immigration actions, which Mayor Keith Wilson praised as a stand against federal overreach. The decision comes amid ongoing tensions with the Trump administration over federal law enforcement presence in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of Americans, particularly older adults who retired before becoming eligible for Medicare, face substantial increases in health insurance premiums if enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies expire. These subsidies, which cap premiums at 8.5% of household income, are set to lapse at the end of the year, and their extension is a point of contention in government shutdown negotiations. An early retiree couple profiled in the article expects their monthly premiums to nearly quadruple, potentially consuming over a quarter of their annual income. The potential lapse could significantly impact household finances for the 22 million people enrolled in ACA marketplace plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three men who followed a Nazi ideology have been sentenced to prison for preparing terrorist acts, including a planned attack on an Islamic education center in Leeds. Christopher Ringrose, Marco Pitzettu, and Brogan Stewart were part of an online group that amassed over 200 weapons, such as machetes and a 3D-printed firearm. The men, who glorified mass murderers and espoused extreme right-wing views, were arrested after undercover officers infiltrated their group when an attack was believed to be imminent. The judge issued extended sentences, stating she believed they remained dangerous and continued to adhere to their violent ideology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean targeting an alleged drug-smuggling vessel, but for the first time, there are reported survivors from the incident. This marks at least the sixth such strike under the Trump administration's campaign against what it labels "narcoterrorists" operating off the coast of Venezuela. The White House maintains the strikes are authorized and effective in reducing drug trafficking, stating they will likely continue. Venezuela's UN ambassador has condemned the strikes as extrajudicial executions of civilians and called for a UN Security Council investigation into the U.S. military's actions.</p>

          <p>The potential transfer of U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine is playing a central role in diplomatic maneuvers between Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that discussions about the long-range missiles prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a meeting with Donald Trump. While Trump has publicly mentioned sending Tomahawks as leverage, he has also expressed concerns about depleting the U.S. stockpile. The strategic value of these missiles lies in their ability to strike high-value Russian targets from a significant distance, though the U.S. currently has a limited number of the necessary ground-based launchers.</p>

Although Snyder had an alibi and was never charged, Shymanski's family expressed suspicions about her potential involvement, which she addressed in an exclusive interview for the program. Holbrook was convicted of first-degree murder, but his defense attorney argued that authorities failed to sufficiently investigate Snyder's potential role in the crime.</p>

          <p>The UK's director of public prosecutions is under pressure from Members of Parliament to explain why a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China was dropped. The prosecutor, Stephen Parkinson, stated the case against parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash and academic Christopher Berry collapsed due to insufficient government evidence proving China posed a national security threat. In response, the government released witness statements detailing China's "large scale espionage" activities, intensifying calls for clarification. Parliamentary committees have now launched inquiries into the matter, demanding answers from both the Crown Prosecution Service and the government.</p>

While remaining a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, Greene's willingness to break from the party line on this and other populist issues reflects her consistent hard-right, Christian nationalist values.

By using mass spectrometers to identify new and dangerous adulterants like medetomidine and nitazenes, the city's public health department can issue rapid alerts to the public and emergency services.

          <p>Small businesses across the United States are facing significant financial distress due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which have dramatically increased the cost of imported goods. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less ability to absorb these costs, forcing them to take out high-interest loans, raise prices, freeze hiring, and delay expansion plans. Many owners report a subsequent drop in sales as consumers react to higher prices, creating a precarious situation that threatens their survival. Economists warn that the struggles of these small businesses could be a leading indicator of broader economic challenges to come for larger companies as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown, now in its third week, has been characterized by political analysts as unusually subdued compared to previous instances. Despite federal workers going unpaid, the shutdown has not generated a sense of crisis in media coverage or on Capitol Hill. This is partly because the central policy dispute over extending Obamacare subsidies is seen as a resolvable issue, unlike past shutdowns over intractable demands. Furthermore, the Trump administration has taken unconventional steps, such as using tariff revenue to fund certain programs, which blunts the public impact and reduces pressure on lawmakers to reach a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>Voters in North Macedonia are participating in local elections that have become a referendum on the national government's handling of the country's stalled European Union membership bid. Despite pressing municipal issues like infrastructure and public transport, the campaign has been dominated by debates over national identity and concessions required to unblock the EU accession process. The country's path has been blocked by Bulgaria, which demands that North Macedonia amend its constitution to recognize its Bulgarian minority. The ruling VMRO-DPMNE party is expected to perform well, despite public division over the country's direction and the prolonged deadlock with the EU.</p>

          <p>Beau Greaves, a 21-year-old darts sensation from Doncaster, has confirmed she will compete in the prestigious PDC World Darts Championship and accept a professional two-year tour card. This decision marks a significant step in her career, as she had previously declined to play in the main world championship at Alexandra Palace. Greaves, a three-time WDF women's world champion, recently secured her spot by finishing as the runner-up on the development tour, becoming only the second woman ever to earn a full-time professional tour card through this route. Her management announced the move was the most logical step for her burgeoning career.</p>

          <p>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) reports that an average of 560 tonnes of food aid has entered Gaza daily since the recent ceasefire began, providing a crucial but insufficient level of support. While the amount marks an improvement, it still falls short of what is required to address the severe humanitarian crisis and famine-like conditions in the enclave. Access to the hardest-hit areas, particularly Gaza City and the north, remains extremely challenging due to the continued closure of key border crossings and damaged infrastructure. The WFP considers the recent increase a breakthrough but emphasizes that much more aid is needed to meet the population's needs.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that participants in the upcoming nationwide "No Kings" protests must maintain strict nonviolence to counteract the narrative being pushed by Donald Trump's allies. Prominent Republicans have labeled the demonstrations a "Hate America rally" organized by violent extremists, a smear campaign intended to delegitimize dissent. The author contends that any instance of violence, regardless of who initiates it, would play directly into the administration's hands and could be used as a pretext for a more severe crackdown on civil liberties. By remaining peaceful, the millions of protesters can effectively demonstrate who the true proponents of democratic values are.</p>

          <p>A sharp increase in car repossessions across the U.S. is raising concerns about the financial health of American households, particularly those with sub-prime auto loans. The collapses of a used car lender and an auto parts supplier have heightened fears on Wall Street of wider credit stress. Repossession agencies report being overwhelmed with work as more consumers default on loans taken out when car prices were high during the pandemic. Economists view rising auto loan delinquencies as a key warning sign, as people typically prioritize car payments to maintain their ability to work, suggesting that household finances are becoming increasingly tight.

          <p>California has successfully navigated another summer without issuing a single "Flex Alert," a call for voluntary energy conservation that was once a common occurrence during heat waves. Experts and state officials attribute this increased grid stability to a massive expansion of battery energy storage capacity, which has grown over 3,000% since 2020. These batteries store excess solar power generated during the day and discharge it onto the grid during peak evening demand, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-powered "peaker" plants. This technological shift has been a game-changer for grid reliability and is crucial to California's goal of achieving 100% carbon-neutral electricity by 2045.</p>

By framing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as a narco-terrorist directly linked to gang violence and drug problems in the U.S., Rubio aligned the issue with Trump's domestic priorities. This strategy led to the U.S. conducting a series of deadly strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug boats and building up military assets in the Caribbean.

          <p>Citing a heightened risk of wildfires, the Malibu City Council has declared a state of emergency and directed law enforcement to remove and, if necessary, arrest homeless individuals engaged in unpermitted camping. The move comes after more than 30 fires in the city since 2021 were believed to have been started by unhoused people cooking or staying warm. The decision to authorize arrests has created a potential policy conflict, as Malibu contracts with the L.A.
