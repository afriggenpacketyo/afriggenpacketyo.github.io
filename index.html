          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme, aiming to combat illegal working and modernize state services. The proposal, which will undergo consultation to ensure inclusivity for all citizens, revives a debate from two decades ago when a similar Labour initiative was blocked. The government, facing pressure on illegal migration, has expressed increasing enthusiasm for the idea, drawing inspiration from countries like Estonia where digital identity streamlines access to services. However, opposition parties and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticize the plan as a cynical ploy that infringes on civil liberties and fails to address core issues.</p>

          <p>A series of drone incidents across Jutland, Denmark, including at airports and military bases, has exposed the NATO member's vulnerability to hybrid warfare. While no damage or harm occurred, the systematic nature of the attacks, which also saw drones near North Sea oil platforms, has prompted a crisis response from Danish officials. Defence chiefs opted not to shoot down the drones due to safety concerns, highlighting a lack of effective counter-drone tools. Denmark is now assessing whether to invoke NATO's Article 4 for consultation, as other Eastern flank allies like Estonia and Poland have recently faced similar incursions, some involving Russian drones.</p>

          <p>The National Archives released a nearly unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to an ally of her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. This disclosure, which included her Social Security number, home addresses, and performance evaluations, potentially violates the Privacy Act. The National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) admitted a technician failed to follow standard procedures, leading to the breach. Sherrill, who had an unblemished Navy career, accused her opponent of illegally weaponizing her records for political gain, while the NPRC apologized and offered identity protection services.</p>

          <p>Shares of CarMax plunged over 20% after the used auto retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. CEO Bill Nash described the quarter, ending August 31, as "challenging," citing changing market conditions, a pull-ahead in sales due to earlier tariff fears, and inventory depreciation. The company's overall vehicle sales dropped 4.1% year-over-year, contributing to a 28% decline in net income. This performance is seen as an early indicator for the broader auto retail sector, causing shares of other car retailers to also decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A second deadly prison riot in Ecuador in days resulted in at least 10 inmate deaths, with images showing some bodies decapitated, as clashes erupted between rival drug gangs in Esmeraldas. This incident adds to approximately 500 inmate deaths since 2021 in Ecuador's overcrowded and violent prisons, which have become operational hubs for organized crime. The country, situated between major cocaine exporters, has seen escalating violence as cartels vie for control, leading President Daniel Noboa to declare an "internal armed conflict." Prison officials have also been targeted, highlighting the severe challenges in controlling these facilities.</p>

          <p>Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to five years in prison for criminal conspiracy, making him the first ex-president to face such a fate, a conviction that has reignited national divisions. The sentence stems from allegations of seeking Libyan campaign money, with Sarkozy vehemently denying the charges and claiming he is a victim of "limitless hatred" from the judiciary and media. His supporters question the severity of the punishment for a lesser charge and the 20-year delay since the alleged offense. Critics, however, view it as further evidence of his history of pushing legal boundaries, citing previous corruption convictions.</p>

Many MPs view his actions as self-serving and damaging to party unity, with some questioning his ability to return to Westminster without a safe seat.

This occurs as the Fed balances price stability and maximum employment, with the bond market hedging against potential inflation fueled by short-term rate cuts. Bond traders are selling longer-dated Treasurys, pushing their yields higher, to protect against a rebound in inflation. Investors are advised to consider whether this dynamic will persist, especially with inflation still above the Fed's 2% target and ongoing tariff uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

The event is set to feature intense security around Trump's visit, adding a political dimension to the already fierce golf rivalry.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal report describes the White House's chaotic handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, stating that a memo quietly released by the Justice Department on July 4th weekend caused a "bomb" to go off internally. The report details a summer of "disorganization" and "unforced errors" as the Trump administration grappled with the scandal. President Trump, who socialized with Epstein previously, was reportedly desperate to distance himself from the case, worrying some friends might be implicated and that files could be doctored to harm him. White House officials initially underestimated the issue, leading to a series of missteps and internal finger-pointing.</p>

          <p>US new car sales are experiencing a surprising boost heading into the fourth quarter, driven by consumers rushing to buy vehicles before anticipated price increases due to tariffs and the expiry of EV tax credits. Cox Automotive raised its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units, up 4.6% year-over-year, attributing the resilient demand to fear-buying. While beneficial for the industry now, analysts expect a slowdown in Q4 and next year as policy changes take full effect. Larger automakers like General Motors, Toyota, and Hyundai have gained market share, while smaller brands and Jeep parent Stellantis have struggled. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is alleging "triple sabotage" during his recent UN General Assembly speech, claiming an escalator malfunction, a non-working teleprompter, and low audio were intentional. He has demanded investigations from both the Secret Service and the UN, calling for arrests related to the escalator incident. The UN, however, attributes the escalator stop to a US videographer accidentally triggering a safety feature and refers teleprompter issues to the White House, which in turn blames UN staff for hindering setup. This dispute highlights ongoing tensions between Trump and the UN, an organization he has frequently criticized and from which he has withheld funding.</p>

          <p>This article explores workaholism, defining it as a compulsion to work excessively even when financially secure and deriving minimal enjoyment. It suggests that this pathology often stems from an unconscious belief that love and intrinsic rewards can be earned through constant toil and exceptional merit. The author posits that childhood experiences, such as conditional parental love based on achievement, can foster this mistaken conviction. To address workaholism, the article advises individuals to confront these origins, prioritize giving true intrinsic love to loved ones, and commit to long-term behavioral changes to foster healthier relationships. This can involve planning career adjustments and scheduling tech-free time with family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Department for Education (DfE) has proposed increasing Ofsted inspection fees for private schools in England, arguing taxpayers should not subsidize private businesses. Last year, Ofsted's inspections of independent schools cost £6.5 million, with only £2.2 million covered by existing fees. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the additional revenue would boost funding for state schools. This proposal follows the government's introduction of VAT on private school fees earlier this year, a move that has drawn accusations of discrimination and led to legal challenges. The DfE's consultation outlines a phased increase in annual fees over the next five years.</p>
