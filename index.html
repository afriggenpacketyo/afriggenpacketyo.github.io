The fire, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has threatened over 1,300 structures and forced the evacuation of 3,000 people. Fire officials are working to contain the blaze, which has impacted traffic due to road closures and caused power outages for over 25,000 customers. The Red Cross has established shelters to support those displaced by the fire, and officials are urging the public not to fly drones in the fire zone.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is struggling with the effects of the US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. Producers are projected to cut capital expenditure, potentially shrinking the annual expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). With higher tariffs impacting exports to the US, producers are looking to cultivate non-US markets. The industry is also dealing with a price war caused by overproduction, resulting in a significant drop in export prices.</p>

          <p>Tyler Hassen, a former oil executive and representative of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has been granted significant authority to implement changes within the Department of Interior. This move has sparked concern among conservation groups, who fear it could lead to the dismantling of national parks and public lands management. The order gives Hassen the power to alter funding and directives, raising questions about the influence of unelected DOGE officials on environmental policy.</p>

The case involves a dispute between families and the Montgomery County Board of Education in Maryland.

          <p>Archaeologists are investigating a medieval cemetery near Cardiff Airport, where they've discovered unusual burials dating back to the 6th or 7th century. The site primarily contains female skeletons buried in unusual positions with artifacts, suggesting both heavy manual labor and signs of wealth. A woman found tossed in a ditch contrasts with the careful burials of others. Analysis of teeth suggests a carb-heavy diet lacking fish, and skeletons come from various regions, adding to the mystery.</p>
