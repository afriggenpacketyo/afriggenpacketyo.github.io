          <p>England midfielder Jordan Henderson has completed a two-year contract signing with Brentford, marking his return to English football after brief spells with Saudi Arabian club Al-Ettifaq and Dutch side Ajax. Henderson, 35, brings a wealth of experience, having spent 12 years with Liverpool where he achieved significant success, including winning the Premier League and Champions League. His recent England recall under manager Thomas Tuchel underscores his continued relevance in the sport. This transfer aims to bolster Brentford's midfield with a seasoned professional, potentially impacting the team's performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the nation did not violate international law by failing to prevent or strictly monitor US drone attacks aided by its Ramstein air base. The case was initiated by two Yemeni men who lost family members in a 2012 drone strike, asserting Germany's partial responsibility. Although the court recognized Germany's human rights obligations abroad, it found no sufficient link to German state authority or evidence of unjustifiable US targeting criteria. This ruling ends a decade-long legal challenge, upholding Germany's position on the matter.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong-Listed Chinese Stocks See Smallest Discount to Onshore Peers in Five Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:30:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong-traded shares of dual-listed Chinese companies are now trading at their smallest discount to mainland-listed shares in nearly five years. This narrowing gap, with H shares trading 22 percent below A shares, is attributed to a weaker US dollar driving global investor diversification and increased mainland investor interest. The Hong Kong market is benefiting from these inflows, particularly as investors seek exposure to major Chinese technology companies poised for growth in artificial intelligence. Analysts remain optimistic about Hong Kong stocks, citing their attractive valuations and potential gains from global capital rebalancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following its Rio de Janeiro summit, the expanded BRICS bloc aims to project a more potent global presence, challenging unipolar dominance and condemning "coercive" economic tactics. Despite leaders calling for de-dollarisation and rejecting US unilateralism, internal contradictions among members like India, Brazil, and South Africa persist. The article questions if BRICS can evolve into a true alternative to the G7 or remain a fractured partnership. While not a formal alliance, the bloc serves as a strategic forum for major emerging economies to collaborate on global governance and financial reform.</p>

          <p>China's Central Committee has released an opinion paper outlining a strategy to enhance its legal tools against foreign sanctions and interference, particularly from the United States and its allies. The directive aims to refine Beijing's judicial toolkit to better understand and challenge trade and technology restrictions imposed on Chinese companies. This move is part of a broader plan to safeguard China's national interests by strengthening the application of international treaties and engaging with foreign law. The initiative reflects China's proactive approach to legal defense in the face of geopolitical pressures.</p>

          <p>Reddit is introducing age verification on its UK platform, requiring users to confirm they are over 18 to access "certain mature content." This measure is in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, which mandates "robust" age-checking techniques for sites displaying adult material. Users can verify their age via a selfie or government ID through an external firm, Persona, ensuring privacy by not sharing photos with Reddit directly. While regulatory bodies welcome the move for child protection, civil liberties advocates express concerns about user privacy and the broader implications of the law.</p>

The move, a decisive diplomatic change, follows Trump's growing frustration with Putin's refusal to end the Ukraine war. While Kyiv welcomes the arms deal, including Patriot missile systems, its long-term military impact remains uncertain without a concrete value.
