          <p>The Trump administration has fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following the release of a jobs report showing a significant hiring slowdown. The report indicated only 73,000 jobs were added in July, with major downward revisions for May and June, suggesting a weaker labor market than previously thought. President Trump baselessly accused the commissioner, a Biden appointee, of falsifying statistics. The White House Council of Economic Advisers acknowledged the numbers were disappointing but expressed optimism for future growth as administration policies take effect.</p>

          <p>A Miami jury found Tesla partially responsible in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning its Autopilot system, ordering the company to pay $200 million in punitive and $129 million in compensatory damages. The case involved a 2019 crash where a Model S using Autopilot struck and killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend. While Tesla argued the driver was solely at fault, the plaintiffs' attorney stated the verdict holds the company accountable for prioritizing its valuation over human lives. Legal experts suggest this verdict could encourage more lawsuits against the electric vehicle manufacturer.</p>

          <p>Aviation company Joby and defense contractor L3Harris have announced a partnership to develop a new military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The craft will be based on Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology and is intended for applications like surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics in contested environments. The collaboration aims to create a smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable alternative to traditional military aircraft like Apache helicopters. Testing is scheduled to begin this fall, with operational demonstrations expected in 2026, aligning with the military's push for autonomous battlefield technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's stock fell by approximately 8% after its second-quarter earnings report, even though revenue and profits exceeded expectations. Investors were primarily concerned by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and slower growth in its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), compared to rivals Microsoft and Google. The company announced it could spend up to $118 billion on capital expenditures this year, largely to support AI infrastructure, raising questions about when these investments will yield returns. Despite these concerns, Amazon demonstrated resilience in its retail and advertising segments, navigating recent U.S. tariff policies better than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has announced it will shut down after the Trump administration and Congress eliminated its federal funding. The nonprofit, which supports over 1,500 local PBS and NPR stations, will begin an orderly wind-down, with most staff positions ending in September. The move follows a campaign by President Trump to defund what he called "left-wing propaganda," culminating in legislation that clawed back $1.1 billion in allocated funds. This closure is expected to severely impact smaller and rural public media stations that rely heavily on federal support for educational programming and local journalism.</p>

The proposal specifically targets California's long-standing authority to set its own stricter tailpipe standards, which has been crucial for its air quality efforts and its plan to ban new gas-powered car sales by 2035. The EPA's own analysis suggests that repealing California's rules and federal tax credits would lead to lower EV adoption and higher gas prices nationally. California officials have vowed to fight the move, describing it as a choice for "polluter fantasyland over proven science."</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Tariff Approach Appears More Strategic, But Economic and Legal Risks Remain High</h2>

          <p>President Trump's recent tariff actions reveal a more coherent strategy of using tariff threats to secure bilateral trade concessions, particularly commitments to buy U.S. goods. Countries that offer satisfactory deals, like the EU and Japan, face lower 15% tariffs, while others are hit with rates of 30% or more to compel negotiations. However, this strategy is fraught with significant risks, including a potential U.S. economic slowdown, as suggested by a recent weak jobs report. Furthermore, the administration's legal authority to impose these tariffs is facing strong challenges in appellate courts, creating deep uncertainty about the policy's long-term viability.

The restaurant was known for its Southern comfort food and remained a popular tourist destination even after the Food Network canceled her show in 2013. Deen's statement thanked customers for their loyalty over 36 years and confirmed that her four other restaurant locations outside of Georgia will remain open.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy, visited a controversial U.S.-backed aid distribution site in Gaza to assess the humanitarian situation. The visit to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site, which was accompanied by the IDF, has been criticized as a "media stunt" by some Gazans and human rights groups. The GHF sites have been the location of numerous deadly incidents, with the UN reporting hundreds of Palestinians killed in their vicinity, a figure the GHF disputes. The visit's purpose was to inform a plan for aid delivery, but critics argue it obscures the reality of a dire crisis that they say U.S. policy has helped create.</p>

          <p>President Trump faced immediate backlash after launching a revived Presidential Fitness Test initiative alongside Lawrence Taylor, a former NFL star and registered sex offender. Taylor, who pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct involving a trafficked 16-year-old girl, stood beside Trump at the White House event, with the president praising him as someone with "nobody like him." Critics condemned the decision to feature a convicted sex offender at an event for a children's health program as a new low. The incident added to a controversial week where Trump also invoked the name of a deceased Jeffrey Epstein accuser.</p>

          <p>Infielder José Caballero experienced a highly unusual trade deadline, as he was dealt from the Tampa Bay Rays to the New York Yankees in the middle of a game between the two teams. Caballero started the game for the Rays, recording a pop-out in the sixth inning, before being informed of the trade and saying goodbye to his teammates in the dugout. As part of the deal, the Rays acquired outfielder Everson Pereira. Caballero, who is tied for the MLB lead in stolen bases, expressed gratitude to the Rays and excitement about joining the Yankees, the team he rooted for as a child.</p>

          <p>The U.S. job market is showing clear signs of weakening after a federal report revealed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, a figure below the level needed to keep pace with population growth. Economists are even more concerned by massive downward revisions for May and June, which cut previous estimates by over 250,000 jobs, painting a much softer picture of the labor market. Factors contributing to the slowdown include the uncertainty created by the administration's tariff policies, which discourages hiring. While layoffs remain low, the overall environment is described as having a "high degree of stagnation." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wildlife groups have condemned the killing of a collared lion named Blondie by a trophy hunter in Zimbabwe, drawing comparisons to the infamous 2015 killing of Cecil the lion. Blondie was part of an Oxford University research project and was allegedly lured out of a protected national park before being legally shot in a hunting zone. While Zimbabwe's parks agency defended the hunt as legal and necessary for conservation funding, critics argue it makes a mockery of hunting ethics, as the lion was a collared, prime breeding male. The incident has reignited the fierce international debate over the morality and conservation value of trophy hunting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 500 points. The slide was driven by a combination of a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and the White House's unveiling of new, high tariffs on dozens of countries. The employment data, which showed only 73,000 jobs added and major downward revisions for previous months, signaled a hiring slowdown. This, coupled with new tariffs of up to 41% on some trading partners, has intensified investor concerns about economic stagnation and prompted bets on a future interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to impose high tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanction a Supreme Court justice has been condemned in Brazil as unacceptable interference. The U.S. justified the measures by citing Brazil's prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, and sanctioned Justice Alexandre de Moraes under the Magnitsky Act. Analysts suggest the move is primarily ideological, aiming to support a political ally and pressure Brazil over its ties with China, rather than being based on trade imbalances. The actions have triggered a nationalist backlash in Brazil and could potentially backfire by strengthening the domestic political standing of those targeted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of UK motorists will be denied compensation for hidden car finance commissions following a pivotal Supreme Court ruling. The court sided with finance companies in two of three test cases, finding that car dealers did not have a fiduciary duty to put customers' interests above their own. This decision reverses earlier rulings that could have led to a massive, industry-wide payout scheme similar to the PPI scandal. While the ruling narrows the scope for claims, compensation may still be possible for customers who had "discretionary commission arrangements," with the UK's financial regulator expected to announce its plans soon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Even with the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, credit card debt forgiveness remains a worthwhile option for consumers struggling with significant balances. Average credit card APRs are still near record highs of 22%, and any future Fed rate cuts are unlikely to provide substantial or immediate relief to borrowers. With total U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.18 trillion, strategies that reduce the principal amount owed, like debt settlement, can be more effective than waiting for minor rate changes. The article suggests this approach is particularly relevant for those nearing default or unable to keep up with minimum payments. (not investment advice)</p>
