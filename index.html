          <p>The UK government is facing criticism from its climate watchdog, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), for insufficient progress in preparing the country for the escalating threats posed by climate change. The report highlights inadequate adaptation measures across various sectors, including healthcare, food, and water supplies, potentially leading to severe economic and health consequences. Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, emphasized the urgency of the situation, noting that climate impacts are intensifying faster than the government's response. The article cites specific examples, such as the vulnerability of hospitals to extreme heat and the increasing frequency of flooding, and a lack of sufficient investment in flood defenses.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have agreed to initiate discussions for key security pacts, including an intelligence-sharing deal, to strengthen their security ties, with China in mind. Nearly 40% of Japanese prefectures are offering financial aid to businesses affected by U.S. tariffs. President Trump eased the impact of his new 25% tariffs on the auto industry, allowing automakers producing vehicles in the United States to claim some reimbursements. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its policy interest rate at 0.5 percent due to uncertainty from U.S. tariffs, while Japan's March industrial output fell 1.1% on month.</p>

Harvard will review admissions processes, faculty standards, and curriculum to promote viewpoint diversity and ensure a welcoming environment for all students.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to ease some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others argued would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum, with some tariff relief for imported components phased out over two years. While automakers welcomed the changes, analysts note that administration policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices.

Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the tariff level that had resulted from separate levies stacking on top of one another. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts set to start by May 3 will still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.

          <p>Waymo, owned by Alphabet, and Toyota have announced a preliminary partnership to explore bringing robotaxi technology to personally-owned vehicles. The companies aim to leverage Waymo's autonomous technology and Toyota's vehicle expertise to enhance next-generation personally owned vehicles, with the goal of more quickly developing driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technologies. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana suggested the partnership could also lead to Toyota vehicles being incorporated into Waymo's ride-hailing fleet. The partnership with Toyota will not affect Waymo's plans to deploy Hyundai and Geely vehicles through the Waymo One ride-hailing service in the future.</p>

The county will fund the settlement by issuing bonds and utilizing its rainy day fund, with payments to victims beginning in January. The county has implemented measures to prevent future abuse, including enhanced vetting of foster parents and probation staff, as well as reducing the use of group homes.</p>

          <p>Two dozen states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over significant cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the administration is attempting to "dismantle" the volunteer service organization as part of its cost-cutting campaign. The lawsuit claims that the cuts, which include staff layoffs and grant eliminations, violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers. The White House defends the cuts, citing AmeriCorps' history of financial mismanagement.

The BBC's analysis reveals that Turkey now effectively controls over 2,000 sq km of Iraqi land through its vast network of military bases, with much of the construction occurring since 2018. Despite Iraq's condemnation of Turkey's military presence, the two countries have signed an agreement to jointly fight the PKK.</p>
