          <h2>New US Legislation on Social Security Taxes Analyzed for Actual Impact on Seniors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 11:20:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill touted as a major tax cut for seniors does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals over 65 with incomes below certain thresholds, which is set to expire in 2028. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax will see no change. Concerns have also been raised that the measure could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund, which is already facing long-term solvency issues.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas were caused by staggering amounts of rainfall over the Fourth of July weekend, with some areas receiving over 20 inches. Data from the National Weather Service shows locations like Bertram, Liberty Hill, and Streeter were inundated with extreme precipitation. This intense downpour caused the Guadalupe River to rise at an unprecedented rate, contributing to the high death toll. The region's topography, characterized by dry, packed soil, exacerbated the runoff and led to the rapid and devastating flash flooding that caught many residents and campers by surprise.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Dr. Fortune Gomo, a 39-year-old scientist who was found fatally injured in Dundee, Scotland. Dr. Gomo, originally from Zimbabwe, had recently earned her PhD from Dundee University and started a new role at Scottish Water. Her family and friends described her as a brilliant and kind person who was the 'deputy parent' of her family and had achieved her life's goals. The local community has expressed shock and sadness, leaving floral tributes at the scene while collections have been started to support her family.</p>

          <p>An active shooter incident at a U.S. Border Patrol sector annex in McAllen, Texas, ended with the suspect being killed. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the individual opened fire at the entrance of the building before being 'neutralized' by Border Patrol agents and local police. One McAllen police officer sustained a non-life-threatening leg injury, apparently from the return fire directed at the suspect. The incident prompted a temporary delay of all flights at the nearby McAllen International Airport as authorities secured the scene and began their investigation.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to at least 89 fatalities, with dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still unaccounted for.

President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration, and a massive search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies is ongoing to locate survivors. Officials are grappling with the scale of the tragedy, which was exacerbated by the rapid and unexpected intensity of the rainfall.</p>

          <p>Former England cricket star James Anderson has strongly advocated for pace bowler Jofra Archer to be included in the lineup for the third Test against India at Lord's. Archer, who has been sidelined from Test cricket for over four years due to injuries, recently made his red-ball comeback and is part of the current squad. Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, stated that the upcoming match is too crucial to delay Archer's return, suggesting it's a risk worth taking rather than waiting until later in the series. The series is currently tied 1-1, making the next match pivotal for both teams.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value fell by approximately 7% following CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he intends to form a new political party called the 'America Party.' This move has reignited investor concerns about his focus being diverted from the electric vehicle company, especially during a period of declining sales and increasing competition. Analysts noted that many Tesla investors are growing weary of Musk's political activities, which they see as a distraction from the company's core business challenges. The announcement also drew criticism from President Trump, who has previously clashed with Musk on policy issues.</p>

          <p>With CD rates currently attractive, financial experts are advising savers on whether to choose short-term or long-term options. One-year CDs offer flexibility in an environment where the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates, allowing investors to reassess their options sooner. Conversely, five-year CDs can lock in the current high yields, protecting against the risk of lower renewal rates in the future. Experts suggest the optimal choice depends on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance, with some recommending a 'bucket' strategy that combines both short and long-term investments.

          <p>In a major move within the AI infrastructure sector, CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is expected to significantly bolster CoreWeave's position by giving it direct ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of data center capacity, reducing future lease costs and enhancing operational efficiency. Core Scientific, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, has been increasingly focusing on high-performance computing. Following the acquisition, Core Scientific shareholders will own less than 10% of the newly combined company.</p>

          <p>Apple has formally appealed a 500 million euro fine from the European Union, calling the penalty 'unprecedented.' The fine was imposed for violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA), with the European Commission stating that Apple's App Store policies illegally restrict developers from informing users about cheaper offers outside the platform. In its appeal, Apple claims the EU is forcing business terms that are confusing for developers and harmful to users. This legal battle is a significant development in the ongoing regulatory clash between major tech companies and European authorities over market competition.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to extend statutory bereavement leave to include parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, paid leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change, which is under consultation, would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, recognizing the grief of early pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement rather than sickness. Campaigners and MPs have praised the move as a significant step forward in acknowledging the emotional trauma of miscarriage and providing necessary support for grieving parents in the workplace.</p>

Polish officials state the checks are intended to combat 'illegal immigration' and will focus on vehicles likely to be used for smuggling, not on ordinary EU citizens.
