        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission is investigating Pornhub, Stripchat, XVideos, and XNXX for potentially violating online content laws related to child safety. The investigation centers on the platforms' apparent lack of effective age verification methods and risk assessment measures to protect minors from harmful content. Regulators are scrutinizing whether current "click away" pop-ups are sufficient for age verification, as stricter regulations are being considered worldwide. Pornhub has previously blocked access in several US states due to age verification laws and suggested device-level verification for enhanced privacy and regulatory compliance. The company faces increasing regulatory pressure as authorities seek to safeguard children's rights online. The BBC has reached out to Pornhub and Stripchat for comment. Optimism score is based on the fact that regulators are actively seeking to protect minors, but it is a negative situation for Pornhub.</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit against President Trump and administration officials, challenging an executive order that seeks to slash federal funding to NPR and PBS. The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment and the Public Broadcasting Act, asserting that Mr. Trump lacks the authority to halt federal funding for these outlets. NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, emphasized that the order is a clear violation of constitutional rights and threatens the existence of a vital public radio system. The lawsuit highlights the importance of public media for millions of Americans who rely on it for news and information. NPR receives approximately 1% of its budget from federal dollars. The lawsuit aims to protect the freedom of speech and the press, which are essential for a healthy democracy.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on films "produced in foreign lands" has triggered widespread concern within the globalized US film industry. The move has prompted worries about rising production costs and the potential collapse of film industries in countries like India. While on-location filming in Hollywood has decreased, the decline is also attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and actors' and writers' strikes, not solely to foreign incentives. Industry experts are divided on whether the tariffs will revitalize Hollywood or spark a content trade war, with some questioning Trump's commitment to the policy. The article notes that the US remains the world's largest film and TV exporter despite increasing competition from global content hubs. The optimism score is based on the uncertainty of the situation and the potential negative impact on global film industries.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-backed group with Israel's approval, has commenced distributing aid in the Gaza Strip, despite facing scrutiny and the resignation of its executive director, Jake Woods. Woods resigned due to concerns that the organization could not adhere to humanitarian principles. The distribution plan involves aid arriving at hubs guarded by armed contractors near Israeli military positions, drawing criticism from the United Nations and other aid groups. The U.N. has labeled the GHF's efforts as a distraction from the need for a larger, principled aid operation. Despite these challenges, the GHF asserts that the flow of supplies to Palestinians in Gaza will increase daily, though concerns persist about its independence and impartiality.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff won her first-round match at the French Open against Olivia Gadecki, despite a pre-match hiccup where she forgot her rackets in the locker room. Gauff, the No. 2 seed, realized the error just as she stepped onto Court Philippe-Chatrier, blaming her coach for the mishap due to his superstition of always packing her bag. A ball boy retrieved the rackets, and Gauff quickly dismissed Gadecki in straight sets. Gauff, the 2023 US Open champion, is aiming for her first title at Roland-Garros, where she reached the final in 2022.

          <p>Southwest Airlines will begin charging $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy. This change, effective Wednesday, applies to tickets purchased on or after that date, excluding those with top-tier loyalty status, Business Select fares, or Southwest credit card holders. The move follows pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management, aiming to boost revenue amid rising baggage fees across the industry. Southwest is also introducing basic economy tickets with limited change options and ending its Wanna Get Away fare.

          <p>The decline of "track II diplomacy," which involves informal dialogue facilitated by NGOs and civil society groups, has negatively impacted conflict resolution between India and Pakistan. For years, these informal channels played a crucial role in building bridges and finding solutions to crises, particularly concerning Kashmir. However, funding issues and decreased government engagement have rendered these networks less effective. The absence of civil society actors has created a vacuum, making it more difficult to smooth out contentious issues.

          <p>Donald Trump issued an unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted on federal fraud and bribery charges. Jenkins was found guilty of accepting over $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. Trump defended Jenkins, calling him a "victim of an overzealous" justice department and criticizing the judge who oversaw the case. Jenkins had appealed directly to the Trump administration for clemency after his conviction. The article also notes other pardons issued by Trump, including those related to the January 6 attack on Congress. The optimism score is based on the fact that the pardon is controversial and reflects a pattern of pardons by Trump.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and House Republicans are pushing to restrict federal benefits for immigrant families, which could largely affect U.S. citizen children with noncitizen parents. Proposed changes in the tax bill would limit the child tax credit to parents with Social Security numbers, impacting roughly two million children.

He said the measures would be paid for by scrapping net-zero climate measures, stopping hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, ending diversity and equality initiatives in the public sector and cutting the number of quangos.
