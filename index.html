            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen discussed his visit to El Salvador to check on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported. Van Hollen stated El Salvador initially resisted his visit but relented, highlighting the government's attempts to deceive the public about Garcia's conditions. He emphasized Garcia's transfer to a less restrictive facility and the ongoing legal battle for his return to the U.S., arguing the case is crucial for upholding constitutional rights for all Americans. Van Hollen urged the Trump administration to present evidence in court regarding alleged gang affiliations rather than relying on social media posts. </p>
