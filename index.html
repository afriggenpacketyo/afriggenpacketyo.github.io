          <p>Adrian Clouatre, a Marine Corps veteran, is struggling to care for his two young children after his wife, Paola, was detained by ICE. Paola, a Mexican national who came to the U.S. seeking asylum as a child, was detained during a green card application appointment due to a deportation order issued after her mother missed a hearing years ago. Despite marrying Adrian in 2024 and attempting to gain legal status, she now faces deportation, leaving the family in distress and raising concerns about the treatment of military families under current immigration policies. Immigration law experts say that prior to the Trump administration's push to drive up deportations, USCIS provided much more discretion for veterans seeking legal status for a family member.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS may be preparing to garnish wages for unpaid tax debt, and there are several warning signs to watch out for. These include receiving multiple notices about unpaid taxes, a Final Notice of Intent to Levy, the filing of a federal tax lien, and direct contact from the IRS to your employer. Taxpayers can take steps to prevent wage garnishment by requesting a Collection Due Process hearing, setting up a payment plan, exploring hardship options, or working with a tax relief specialist; acting proactively is crucial to resolving tax debt and protecting your paycheck.

Inventory is up more than 20% year-over-year, shifting the market in favor of buyers in some areas, while condo sales are particularly weak, with 83% more sellers than buyers.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a 10-year industrial strategy focused on lowering energy costs for businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. This initiative, part of a broader plan to boost economic growth, aims to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, while energy-intensive firms will see network charge cuts increase to 90% from 2026. The strategy also includes measures to expedite energy grid connections for new factories and projects, alongside plans to improve workers' skills and attract global talent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump demanded that "everyone" keep oil prices down to avoid playing "into the hands of the enemy" as tensions in the Middle East escalate following U.S. strikes on Iran. In a post on Truth Social, Trump urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling, despite oil production decisions being made by private companies in response to market dynamics. His message followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, which initially caused a brief spike in oil prices before futures trading stabilized; oil prices have since decreased.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the July policy meeting if inflation pressures remain contained.

She believes that tariffs are likely to have a temporary and muted impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, is drawing level with Andrew Cuomo in the city’s primary, according to a new poll. The survey indicates that Mamdani may even be leading Cuomo, particularly when ranked-choice voting is simulated. Mamdani has surged in recent weeks, setting up a contest between a centrist and a progressive, and the race has been colored by international politics, with some accusing Mamdani of being antisemitic after he defended the phrase “globalize the intifada.”</p>

Insurers will implement these changes across various markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans, benefiting an estimated 257 million Americans. The commitments include creating a standardized system for online submissions and reducing the number of claims subject to prior authorization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more homeowners consider home equity loans, experts caution against taking on excessive debt, even with attractive interest rates. They recommend examining your entire financial picture, including debt-to-income ratio, credit score, home equity, income stability, and emergency fund. A high DTI ratio (above 43%), low credit score (below 680), low home equity (less than 20%), unstable income, and lack of an emergency fund are indicators that a home equity loan may be too risky. Strengthening these fundamentals before borrowing can save you from putting your home in jeopardy. (not investment advice)</p>
