          <p>Nasdaq is proposing new rules that would require companies primarily operating in China to raise at least $25 million in their initial public offerings to list on the exchange. This move aims to curb "pump and dump" schemes associated with small-float IPOs and protect U.S. investors, given the difficulty of taking legal action against entities involved in manipulative trading. The change comes amid simmering U.S.-China trade tensions and follows years of increased scrutiny over a flood of tiny, high-risk Chinese IPOs in the U.S. market. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must approve the proposal for it to take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite new government initiatives aimed at boosting the country's declining birth rate, significant doubts remain among the public regarding the effectiveness of China's latest child subsidy programs. Many citizens and experts question whether the financial incentives offered are substantial enough to offset the high costs of education, healthcare, and housing associated with raising children in modern China. The reluctance to have more children is deeply rooted in societal and economic pressures that have developed over decades. Consequently, there is widespread skepticism that these new subsidies alone will be sufficient to reverse the demographic trend and encourage families to expand.</p>

          <p>Huawei has launched the Mate XTs, its second-generation trifold smartphone, with a starting price of approximately $2,520 in China. The device features two hinges, allowing it to unfold into a tablet, a design concept Huawei pioneered last year. This release is a key part of the company's strategy to solidify its comeback in the Chinese market, where it has regained the top position with an 18% market share. Despite ongoing U.S. sanctions that have restricted its access to key technologies since 2020, Huawei's continued innovation in premium devices like the Mate XTs demonstrates its resilience and dominance in the foldable phone category.</p>

          <p>Survivors of abuse by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell gathered on Capitol Hill to demand the full, unredacted release of all Justice Department files related to the case. Speaking at a press conference, they argued that transparency is essential for justice and to hold all involved individuals, regardless of their status, accountable for their actions. The push for the "Epstein Files Transparency Act" comes after an initial release of documents was criticized for being heavily redacted and containing previously public information. Survivors shared powerful testimonies, emphasizing that the full truth is necessary to prevent future abuse and to help them in their lifelong journey of healing.</p>

In response to this uncertainty, Jet2 plans to reduce its seat capacity for the upcoming season to maintain attractive pricing.

          <p>Portugal is observing a national day of mourning following a tragic accident in Lisbon where a historic funicular streetcar derailed, killing 15 people and injuring 23. The 19th-century "Elevador da Gloria," a popular tourist attraction, crashed into a building after seemingly losing control on a steep hill during evening rush hour. Authorities are investigating the cause, with possibilities including a faulty brake or a snapped cable, while recovery and identification efforts are underway. The city has halted operations of its other funiculars for immediate safety inspections following the capital's worst accident in recent memory.</p>

The move, effective immediately, follows a Chinese investigation which concluded that U.S. exporters were altering trade patterns to circumvent existing duties. This action was announced shortly after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned a Guangzhou-based chemical company over claims related to fentanyl production.

The court reasoned that the state has the authority to ensure public transit systems remain free from accessible firearms for public safety.

The issue stems from the purchase of her flat in Hove, where the higher rate for a second home was not paid due to complex tax laws involving a trust set up for her son. Experts suggest that if HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) determines her actions were "careless," even if based on poor legal advice, she could be liable for a penalty of up to 30% of the unpaid tax.

          <p>Experts from Historic England have determined that the iconic Sycamore Gap tree was between 100 and 120 years old when it was illegally cut down in September 2023. By counting the growth rings in a cross-section of the trunk, a process known as dendrochronology, researchers established a minimum age range for the beloved Northumberland landmark. The tree, which stood next to Hadrian's Wall, was believed to have been planted in the late 1800s. The analysis revealed that the tree was formed by two stems that fused together when they were about 30 years old, and the preserved section will undergo further study.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its fight over trade policy to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to quickly overturn a federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of the president's tariffs illegal. The government argues that the lower court's decision creates uncertainty in foreign negotiations and jeopardizes existing trade deals. The appeals court had found that the president overstepped his authority by using an emergency powers law to impose the sweeping import taxes. This legal battle places a central component of President Trump's economic and trade strategy before the nation's highest court, with significant implications for both government revenue and businesses affected by the levies.</p>

          <p>A new scientific report from World Weather Attribution concludes that climate change made the weather conditions fueling this summer's devastating wildfires in Spain and Portugal 40 times more likely. The analysis found that the extreme heat and dry conditions were also 30% more intense due to global warming driven by fossil fuels. These fires burned over 640,000 hectares combined, accounting for two-thirds of all land burned in Europe this year. The report emphasizes that rising temperatures are creating longer and more ferocious fire seasons, stretching firefighting resources and highlighting the urgent need for better forest management and a rapid shift away from fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>During Kim Jong Un's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin in Beijing, North Korean staff were observed meticulously wiping down every item the leader touched, including his chair and coffee table. Analysts explain that this is part of a comprehensive security protocol designed to prevent foreign intelligence agencies from obtaining biological samples like hair or skin cells. Such samples could reveal insights into Kim's health conditions. This practice, which extends to bringing a personal toilet on foreign trips, has been a standard procedure since the era of his father, Kim Jong Il, to protect sensitive information about the supreme leader's physical state.</p>

          <p>A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that the Chinese public has a more flexible view of its global role than commonly perceived in the U.S. While optimistic about their nation's future, a plurality of 48% of respondents expressed interest in a "shared leadership role" with other world powers, implying a desire for peaceful coexistence rather than global dominance. This nuanced perspective suggests potential avenues for reducing U.S.-China tensions, according to the report's authors. However, they also cautioned that some responses may have been influenced by self-censorship, given the political environment in China.</p>

The facility, dubbed "Louisiana Lockup," will house over 400 male detainees convicted of serious crimes, with Noem stating the prison's fearsome reputation is meant to encourage self-deportation. The prison has a long and brutal history, originating as a slave plantation and later becoming known as "the bloodiest prison in America."

          <p>China's recent military parade, showcasing its advanced weaponry, served as a clear message of its growing global power, an alternative to the U.S.-led world order. This event underscores the potential geopolitical consequences of President Trump's "America First" trade policies, which have pushed nations like China, Russia, and India closer together. While Trump views tariffs as a tool to protect American industry, his actions risk creating new international alignments that challenge U.S. influence. Furthermore, the legal foundation of these tariffs is being challenged in U.S. courts, adding another layer of risk to a high-stakes strategy that could reshape global dynamics.</p>
