          <p>President Trump celebrated the passage of a major legislative package, dubbed the "megabill," during a rally in Iowa, promoting its tax cuts as the largest in U.S. history. He also detailed plans for the "America 250" celebration, which includes a UFC fight on the White House lawn and a new National Garden of American Heroes. The president commented on recent military strikes against Iran, framing the past two weeks as highly successful for his administration. He asserted that the military action led to the "complete obliteration" of Iran's nuclear facilities and recounted a conversation where he claims Iranian officials respectfully informed him of their retaliatory strike.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that discussions are underway to form a new left-wing political party, following an announcement by ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana that she was leaving the party to co-lead the new venture with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated his delight that she will help build a real alternative to the current political system. This move formalizes efforts by a small group of independent pro-Gaza MPs, coordinated by Corbyn, to establish a party that could contest in upcoming local elections. While some on the left of the Labour party have praised the move, none have yet committed to joining.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Los Angeles for overstaying his visa and allegedly providing fraudulent statements on a green card application. The arrest occurred just days after his high-profile fight against Jake Paul. U.S. officials stated that Chávez will be processed for expedited removal and deported to Mexico, where he faces an outstanding arrest warrant related to organized crime and arms trafficking. His attorney noted he was taken into custody without his family being informed, amid the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration. Chávez's family has expressed full confidence in his innocence.</p>

          <p>Following the recent conflict with Israel, Iran's regime is reportedly escalating domestic repression at an alarming rate, with some analysts suggesting a move toward a "North Korea-style model of isolation and control." According to experts and sources within Iran, there has been an unprecedented increase in suppression, including random phone searches for pro-Israel content and internet blackouts to control information. This crackdown is seen as a sign of the regime's weakness and fear of internal dissent. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is also reportedly facing an internal crisis, with pressure to purge senior commanders, potentially leading to the rise of more radical and volatile leadership.</p>

          <p>Scientists are currently tracking 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, which was recently spotted by a telescope in Chile. The comet is approximately 20 kilometers wide and is traveling at about 60 kilometers per second, but it poses no danger to Earth, with its closest approach in October being over 1.5 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. While its exact origin is unknown, astronomers believe it came from the direction of the Milky Way's galactic center. The discovery highlights advancements in telescope technology, and scientists expect to detect more such objects with new systems like the Vera Rubin Observatory going online soon.</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at a petrol station in Rome's Prenestino neighborhood has resulted in at least 29 injuries, including police officers and firefighters. The incident began when a tanker truck struck a pipe, causing a gas leak and an initial smaller blast, which was followed by a much larger explosion as a fire broke out. The second blast caused extensive damage to nearby vehicles and buildings, with eyewitnesses describing a massive fireball and a shockwave felt across the city. Officials noted that the evacuation of a nearby sports center just before the main explosion likely prevented a more severe tragedy, as many people were expected in the area.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's latest budget proposal includes severe cuts to the National Science Foundation (NSF), sparking concerns about the future of U.S. scientific research and economic growth. The bill proposes a 56% cut to the NSF's $9 billion budget, a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships, and the abrupt cancellation of over 1,600 active research grants. Critics argue that dismantling the nation's primary funder of fundamental research across all scientific fields risks losing a generation of talent and jeopardizes American innovation. The Guardian is soliciting stories from scientists, researchers, and students to understand the real-world impact of these cuts on scientific output and their specific concerns.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed budget slashes NASA's funding by nearly a quarter, a move that critics, including The Planetary Society, have called an "extinction-level event" for the agency. The cuts would reduce NASA's funding to 1961 levels, adjusted for inflation, and severely threaten key scientific missions, including the search for extraterrestrial life. Specifically, the Science Mission Directorate faces a nearly 50% cut, jeopardizing the development of the Habitable Worlds Observatory and forcing the abandonment of 19 active missions.

          <p>A prominent Chinese academic has suggested that for a potential summit between President Trump and Chinese leadership to be successful, the U.S. must first clarify its position on Taiwan. Wu Xinbo, dean of Fudan University's Institute of International Studies, stated that Trump should explicitly declare that the U.S. does not support Taiwan's independence, a move he argues would align with past U.S. presidential statements. This call for clarity comes after the U.S. State Department recently removed a phrase opposing Taiwan's independence from its website. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province, and the issue remains a highly sensitive point in U.S.-China relations.</p>

It is also important to calculate the value of the time saved by outsourcing the labor compared to the expense. Furthermore, the potential for reduced stress and maintaining peace of mind is a significant factor. Finally, one must ensure that the cost of hiring movers does not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to taking on high-interest debt.</p>

Similarly, Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson's biography of McCardell shows how the designer prioritized comfort and practicality, creating clothes for "doers" with features like pockets and accessible zippers. Both works advocate for a shift in perspective, valuing what bodies can do over how they look, offering a refreshing alternative to restrictive beauty standards.</p>

The proposal, still in its early stages, aims to form a new trade organization with like-minded partners, potentially starting with the CPTPP trade bloc in Asia. This new framework would establish strong rules on fair competition and industrial subsidies, effectively creating an alliance that could initially exclude both the protectionist U.S. and China, which is seen as distorting markets. While business groups express caution about splintering global trade, proponents see it as a strategic move to promote trade liberalization and pressure the U.S. and China to reform.

The bill also introduces new work requirements for food stamp (SNAP) recipients and boosts defense and immigration enforcement funding by over $100 billion. Other elements include a temporary tax break on Social Security income, an increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, all of which could add trillions to the federal deficit.

A second group of countries may see the current 10% baseline tariff extended as negotiations continue in good faith. However, a third group of nations, viewed as uncooperative, could face a sharp increase in tariffs, potentially triggering inflation and market instability. Experts suggest an extension is likely for many, as finalizing complex trade deals in 90 days is challenging. (not investment advice)</p>

The discovery has puzzled researchers, who are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at the fort to understand why so many large-sized shoes were discarded there.

They point to a federal government that is hostile to racial equity, actively dismantling protections, and weaponizing law to silence dissent. Instead of despair, the authors call for grassroots action, urging citizens to engage in their communities, reimagine institutions, and work towards a more robust, multiracial democracy that lives up to its stated ideals.</p>

          <p>In Springfield, Ohio, community volunteers are urgently working to help Haitian families secure U.S. passports for their American-born children. This effort comes as the Trump administration announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, which could lead to their deportation by September. Without passports, thousands of U.S. citizen children could become stateless or be separated from their parents if they are forced to leave the country. The situation is compounded by a dire humanitarian and security crisis in Haiti, which makes returning unsafe, and legal battles over the administration's power to end TPS and birthright citizenship, creating a climate of intense fear and uncertainty for the community.</p>

Some travelers from Canada and Europe cite concerns over safety and a desire to spend their money in more inclusive destinations as reasons for changing their plans. Travel platform misterb&b reported a significant decline in U.S. bookings from Canadian and European users. This trend could impact the U.S. economy, as the LGBTQ+ travel market represents significant purchasing power.

          <p>Apple is experiencing a period of contrasting fortunes, celebrating the blockbuster success of its movie "F1" while facing scrutiny over its slow progress in artificial intelligence. The film's success highlights Apple's strength in long-term investment and marketing, growing its services business into a cultural force. However, Wall Street remains underwhelmed by the company's AI advancements, particularly the delayed rollout of a more sophisticated, conversational Siri. While competitors like Google and OpenAI are rapidly advancing their AI assistants, Apple's privacy-focused approach and lack of major AI talent acquisitions have left it behind, creating a potential long-term vulnerability for its hardware ecosystem.</p>

Another notable trend is the rise of chef-led brands bringing restaurant-quality sauces and foods to home kitchens. Additionally, beef tallow is gaining traction as a cooking fat, promoted as an alternative to seed oils, while plant-based products are being marketed more on taste rather than their vegan credentials.</p>

          <p>The latest installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, "Jurassic World Rebirth," is described as a visually impressive but ultimately hollow and unnecessary film. Directed by Gareth Edwards, the movie features a strong sense of scale and clean action sequences but suffers from a plodding narrative and underdeveloped characters. The plot, a familiar mix of mercenaries and a shipwrecked family on a dinosaur-infested island, fails to generate suspense or emotional investment. Despite a capable cast including Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, the characters seem bored by the proceedings, and the dinosaurs are reduced to mere background threats. The film is criticized for lacking a compelling reason to exist beyond its box office potential.</p>

          <p>The European Union is struggling with internal divisions as it negotiates with the United States to avoid a significant tariff hike set for July 9. While a comprehensive trade deal is seen as impossible in the short timeframe, the EU hopes for an "agreement in principle," potentially modeled after the recent U.S.-U.K. deal. However, member states are split on what concessions are acceptable, with Germany appearing more willing to accept a 10% baseline tariff to protect its auto industry, a position France may oppose. Experts believe a deal is unlikely without the removal of steep U.S. tariffs on European cars, steel, and aluminum, leaving the EU to weigh the economic impact of a no-deal scenario.

          <p>This essay explores how the Continental Army, under General George Washington, was instrumental in creating a unified American identity during the Revolutionary War. In 1775, the colonies lacked a shared culture, viewing each other as competitors rather than compatriots. The army brought together men from 13 different colonies, and their shared experiences of hardship and sacrifice on the battlefield blurred provincial loyalties and fostered new national bonds. The army also established unifying traditions, such as celebrating Washington's birthday instead of the King's and adopting a national flag. In the postwar years, veterans continued this nation-building project, advocating for a strong federal government to preserve the republic they fought to create.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on Virginia Woolf's 1928 work, "A Room of One's Own," arguing for its continued relevance in understanding the systemic barriers women face. The author recounts initially dismissing the book as a totem of exclusionary white feminism but later discovering its profound insights into the necessity of financial independence and personal space for creative and intellectual freedom. The article draws parallels between Woolf's arguments and contemporary issues, such as the gender pay gap and the dismissal of women's stories. While acknowledging the book's limitations, the author suggests Woolf's core message about the link between economic control and mental freedom resonates with the modern, intersectional feminist movement.</p>
