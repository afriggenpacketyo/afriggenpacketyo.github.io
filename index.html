          <h2>Israel Initiates Daily 'Tactical Pauses' in Gaza to Facilitate Humanitarian Aid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 10:20:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has implemented a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter the strip amid a severe hunger crisis. This decision follows mounting international pressure and warnings of famine, with images of malnourished children drawing global criticism. While the UN and aid agencies welcome the measure as a way to reach starving people, they reiterate that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the full scale of the humanitarian catastrophe. The pauses are localized and do not signify an end to Israel's wider military operations against Hamas.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with US President Donald Trump and will use the opportunity to discuss the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting comes as international diplomatic efforts to halt the conflict have stalled and aid agencies continue to warn of mass starvation in the territory. The British government has expressed deep concern over the humanitarian situation, describing it as "utterly horrifying" and has been involved in aid drops. The discussion highlights the ongoing international pressure on both Israel and Hamas to find a resolution.</p>

          <p>An attack on a Catholic church in eastern Congo, attributed to the Islamic State-backed Allied Democratic Force (ADF), has resulted in at least 34 deaths. The assailants, armed with guns and machetes, stormed the church in Komanda town, Ituri province, and also burned several houses and shops. This incident is part of a pattern of deadly violence in the region, where armed groups frequently target civilians. A local civil society leader has condemned the attack and called for immediate military intervention to protect the town.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is spending a second day in Scotland, combining leisure with high-stakes diplomacy as he prepares for trade talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The US president played a round of golf at his Turnberry resort amid a significant security presence and a small group of his supporters. The anticipated meeting with von der Leyen is focused on transatlantic trade relations, with Trump having previously stated there is a "50-50" chance of reaching an agreement. He is also scheduled to meet with UK and Scottish leaders during his visit.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are jointly advocating for a subpoena of Jeffrey Epstein's estate, seeking more than just a reported birthday book. Massie emphasized the need to "follow the money" by obtaining financial records and details of Epstein's plea bargain to uncover the full extent of his network. Their joint legislation aims to force a House vote on the release of the files, though it was delayed by the August recess. The representatives are now pursuing a discharge petition to bypass the Speaker and compel a vote on the matter.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old boy in foster care has died in Alabama after being left in a hot vehicle by a state-contracted worker. The child was supposed to be transported to a daycare program following a supervised visit with his father but was instead left alone in the car for hours. Police responded to a report of an unresponsive child and he was pronounced dead at the scene, with the chief deputy coroner noting no other competing cause of death. The incident has triggered a police investigation into potential criminal charges and prompted a state senator to call for an examination of state laws.</p>

          <p>A new government savings plan, dubbed the 'Trump IRA,' allows parents to contribute up to $5,000 annually for children under 18, with a one-time $1,000 government contribution for those born in a specific timeframe. While the tax-free growth is a benefit, this article argues that other strategies offer more substantial long-term advantages. Alternatives like 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs provide greater flexibility and potential returns for educational or long-term goals. The author also advocates for whole life insurance policies, which can lock in low premiums and build cash value over a child's lifetime. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness stems from more than just increased leisure time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that workers feel more effective and productive while on the clock. Faced with a condensed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes, eliminate busywork, and focus on high-impact tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This feeling of being on top of their work reduces stress and improves overall well-being, which in turn spills over into their personal lives.</p>

          <p>This article presents a deep analysis of Donald Trump's character, arguing that his core motivation is an insatiable avarice expressed through a constant pursuit of adversarial deals. Unlike market-based entrepreneurship, Trump's dealmaking focuses on personal reputation and speculation, allowing him to claim victory regardless of the outcome and evade measurable consequences. This approach, termed "egonomics," connects his narcissistic urges directly to accumulating money, which the author contends is his ultimate goal, more so than power or prestige. The piece further explores how this mindset is perfectly suited for the unregulated, high-risk world of cryptocurrency.</p>

          <h2>Travel Writer Lists Common Phrases That Can Make American Tourists Sound 'Obnoxious'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A travel expert with experience in 70 countries outlines several phrases that American tourists should avoid to prevent sounding rude or ignorant while abroad. These include asking for prices in U.S. dollars, commenting on how cheap things are, and assuming other countries are divided into states. The author also advises against seeking out American corporate chains like Starbucks instead of supporting local businesses. Complimenting someone's English can be perceived as condescending, and using outdated terms like "third-world country" can come off as judgmental, undermining the goal of respectful cultural exchange.</p>

          <h2>Dietitians Weigh In on Whether Raw Vegetables Can Harm Gut Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While raw vegetables are an excellent source of fiber and nutrients, they may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with pre-existing gut conditions like IBS or IBD. Dietitians explain that the firm texture and high volume of raw veggies can be difficult for some people to digest, potentially causing bloating and gas. Cooking vegetables breaks down their fibers, making them easier to digest and absorb. While cooking can reduce some heat-sensitive vitamins, it can also enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients. Experts recommend a mix of raw and cooked vegetables for a balanced, gut-friendly diet.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for talks aimed at ending a deadly border dispute that has killed at least 34 people and displaced over 168,000. The meeting was arranged after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with both leaders, urging them to negotiate a ceasefire. Despite diplomatic efforts and an agreement to talk, fighting has continued along the contested border, with both sides trading blame for renewed shelling. The conflict flared up after a landmine explosion injured Thai soldiers, escalating a decades-old frontier dispute.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of stabilizing under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company a year ago. The manufacturer's aircraft production and delivery numbers have improved, and Wall Street analysts anticipate the company could post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Despite facing challenges like a major machinists' strike and renewed FAA scrutiny after a door-plug blowout, Ortberg's hands-on approach has been credited with changing the company's culture. Major airline customers have noted a dramatic improvement in production quality and delivery predictability.</p>

          <p>Top delegations from the US and the European Union have converged at Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland for critical talks aimed at averting a trade war. The meeting, which Trump stated has a "50/50" chance of success, could result in a major trade pact. If talks fail, Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on all EU imports starting August 1. An agreement would likely establish a baseline tariff of 15% on EU goods, providing stability for global investors and key European industries like the automotive sector, which have faced uncertainty since Trump's tariff threats began.</p>

          <p>In Bogotá, Colombia, a frustrating scam known as "pinchallantas" (tire-puncturers) is on the rise, where saboteurs on motorcycles deliberately damage car tires. They scatter sharp objects on busy streets and then approach the stranded motorists, offering to guide them to a nearby mechanic who is often in on the scheme. These mechanics are suspected of creating additional punctures and then overcharging for the repairs. The practice has become so common that it is a frequent topic on local newscasts, and city officials have launched a crackdown targeting the complicit repair shops.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is using billboards near struggling rural hospitals in red states to blame Donald Trump for potential closures. The campaign highlights the impact of over $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts from Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which is expected to severely strain rural healthcare facilities. Since 2010, 153 rural hospitals have already closed, and analyses predict hundreds more are at risk due to the funding cuts. While Republicans included a $50 billion "rural health transformation fund" in the bill, Democrats argue it is insufficient and functions as a political "slush fund."</p>

Local merchants report that while customer traffic remains steady, spending has dropped significantly on goods imported from China, such as traditional foods, teas, and furniture. One long-time supermarket owner noted that costs have risen by an average of 50 percent due to the tariffs. This has forced customers to cut back on their purchases, posing a significant challenge to the small businesses that form the backbone of the historic district.</p>

          <p>This article posits that Donald Trump's presidency, characterized by cronyism and policies favoring insiders, is inadvertently making socialist ideas more appealing to a new generation. The author traces the decline of socialist credibility after the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of a pro-market consensus in the West. However, recent economic shocks and the perception of a rigged system under Trump have fueled disillusionment with capitalism. The piece argues that while modern socialists lack a coherent plan for wealth creation, their rise is a direct response to a form of "ersatz capitalism" that vilifies free exchange.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the near disappearance of comprehensive arts and music event listings from major publications like The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Village Voice. The author, a musician, argues that these listings were once a vital public good, serving as a roadmap for audiences and providing crucial visibility for emerging and niche artists. Their decline, driven by changing media economics and a critical shift toward covering already-popular mainstream acts, has made it harder for subcultures to thrive. This has left artists more reliant on algorithms and has erased a valuable historical record of a city's cultural life.</p>
