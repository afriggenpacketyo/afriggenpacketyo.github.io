          <p>Israel initiated a series of strikes against Iran, targeting what it claims are the core components of Iran's nuclear program, prompting a state of emergency declaration within Israel. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that the strikes were preemptive, anticipating a retaliatory missile and drone attack from Iran. Air raid sirens were activated in Tel Aviv following the announcement of the Israeli operation. The United States has stated that it was not involved in the Israeli action, emphasizing its priority is protecting American forces in the region. The situation is rapidly escalating, heightening concerns about a wider regional conflict.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has announced a 100 billion yen policy package aimed at attracting foreign researchers, particularly those potentially leaving the United States due to research funding cuts. The initiative seeks to establish an elite research environment in Japan, focusing on competitive fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. The government intends to utilize profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support internationally competitive research at universities. Science and technology policy minister Minoru Kiuchi emphasized Japan's commitment to becoming the most attractive destination for researchers worldwide, aiming to improve Japan's standing in scientific research and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, investors are moving towards safe-haven assets due to increased fears of regional conflict escalation. The strikes, which Israel claims targeted Iran's nuclear program, have surprised markets, leading to a risk-off sentiment across various asset classes. Gold prices have risen to nearly a two-month high, while U.S. Treasury prices have increased, causing yields to fall. Oil prices have surged dramatically due to concerns about potential retaliation from Iran and possible disruptions to oil supply, highlighting the market's sensitivity to geopolitical instability.</p>

          <p>The newly elected Mark Carney government in Canada has introduced Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act, which is facing criticism for its potential impact on privacy and refugee policies. The bill grants law enforcement greater access to citizen data and aligns Canada's refugee policies more closely with those of the United States. Critics argue the bill infringes on privacy rights by allowing police to collect subscriber information without a warrant under vaguely defined circumstances. Additionally, it introduces stricter rules for refugee claims, potentially affecting vulnerable groups such as women, racialized claimants, and LGBTQ individuals, raising concerns about due process and human rights.</p>

          <p>Iran and Israel have been adversaries for decades, with escalating tensions marked by recent Israeli attacks on Iranian soil. The relationship between the two nations was once amicable, with Iran being one of the first states to recognize Israel in 1948. However, the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran led to a complete reversal of relations, as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Despite the current animosity, not all Iranians support the hostile stance, with some advocating for a reassessment of the relationship to align with modern times.</p>

          <p>In response to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the United States, Beijing is promoting the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs serve as a financial guarantee, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. While international L/Cs are limited to physical goods transactions, domestic L/Cs can also be used for trade in services, providing greater flexibility for businesses.

          <p>German machinery manufacturers are urging the European Union to implement trade barriers to protect them from what they view as unfair competition from Chinese companies. The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) has published a position paper calling for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a particular focus on China. The industry group argues that Chinese companies receive heavy government subsidies and sometimes disregard technical regulations, creating an uneven playing field. The VDMA's call represents a significant shift for an industry that previously praised the Sino-German economic relationship.</p>

State media reports the ship has been fully restored, though experts question the completeness of the repairs given the speed of the relaunch.

          <p>Asian stock markets opened lower, while oil prices surged following Israeli airstrikes on Iran amid escalating tensions over Iran's nuclear program. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose significantly, as did Brent crude, reflecting investor concerns about potential disruptions to oil supply. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 and Seoul's Kospi both experienced declines, as did Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite Index. Despite the initial market downturn, some analysts anticipate a quick recovery in Asian markets due to their limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties with unaffected countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>

          <p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared ongoing attacks to eliminate Iran's nuclear program. The strikes targeted nuclear fuel production, bomb assembly, and rocket facilities, along with the alleged assassination of key Iranian nuclear and military personnel. Israel claims Iran was close to assembling nuclear weapons, a claim hard to verify, but consistent with Iran's shifting political calculations regarding nuclear armament. Israel's repeated attacks on Iranian assets abroad and within Iran itself have diminished Iran's deterrent power, potentially pushing it to pursue nuclear statehood to regain lost influence.</p>
