          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are employing innovative and non-lethal methods, utilizing drones that blast AC/DC's “Thunderstruck” and movie clips featuring actors like Scarlett Johansson, to deter gray wolves from cattle. This experiment by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service aims to mitigate increasing conflicts between recovering wolf populations and ranchers, a growing concern since the species' reintroduction. While early trials have shown success in interrupting wolf hunts, questions persist regarding the long-term effectiveness of the drones as wolves might habituate to the noise, and the high cost of the specialized technology presents a barrier for many ranchers. The article highlights the creative approach to wildlife management.</p>

Relatives and human rights activists marched in major cities, highlighting the widespread impact of forced disappearances, often at the hands of drug cartels or security forces. Many affected families have formed "buscadores" search teams, who scour dangerous regions for mass graves at great personal risk.

          <p>The Stringfellow family, a long-standing showpeople family, is battling Glasgow City Council over their eviction from a self-built yard on Water Row, Govan, where they have lived for over 40 years. The council seeks to clear the site for a multi-million-pound regeneration project along the Clyde waterfront, despite the family's deep roots and previous successful challenges against eviction. The family is taking their case to Scotland's highest court, arguing that the eviction violates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as it would displace a five-year-old granddaughter and undermine their right to a secure home. The article highlights the family's fight to protect their home and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>German beer sales have reached their lowest point in over 30 years, falling by 6.3% in the first half of 2025, while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013, indicating a significant market shift. This trend reflects changing drinking habits and increased health consciousness among young Germans, leading breweries like Erdinger to adapt by promoting alcohol-free options at sporting events. While full-strength beer remains a significant cultural element, particularly in regions like Bavaria, the article highlights a detectable trend towards more conscious consumption and the growing market for non-alcoholic beverages. This cultural evolution challenges traditional German drinking norms.</p>

          <p>The iconic Metal Gear Solid series has returned with a remake of its third installment, "Metal Gear Solid Delta," nearly a decade after its creator Hideo Kojima acrimoniously left publisher Konami. The article explores the history of the split, attributed partly to the spiraling costs of 2015's Metal Gear Solid V, and Konami's subsequent shift away from console games. The remake, praised for its faithful recreation, improved graphics, and audio, aims to appeal to both nostalgic fans and new players, demonstrating the lucrative trend of gaming remakes in the industry. This move marks Konami's return to console publishing and a new chapter for the beloved franchise.</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, a nearly 1,000-year-old artwork documenting the Norman invasion of England, will close to the public in France on Monday amidst growing opposition to its planned move to the British Museum in London next year. French art experts and the public fear the 70m-long masterpiece is too delicate for transport, with a petition against the loan garnering 60,000 signatures and describing it as a "cultural crime." Despite French President Macron and UK Prime Minister Starmer announcing the loan, specialists worry that vibrations from the journey could cause irreparable damage.

          <p>The UK is employing an unusual arsenal, including drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating pest threatening the nation's forests. The beetle, which has killed millions of spruce trees in Europe, was discovered to be arriving in the UK via wind, not imported wood, as initially thought. Government scientists claim successful eradication in at-risk areas in the east and southeast England, marking a significant achievement. However, climate change, leading to stressed trees and larger beetle populations in Europe, could exacerbate future incursions, making ongoing vigilance crucial.

          <p>A California state bill, SB 256, aimed at requiring investor-owned utilities like Southern California Edison to remove decommissioned power lines to prevent catastrophic wildfires, has failed in Sacramento. Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, who introduced the bill after her district was devastated by the Eaton fire, expressed profound frustration over the lack of accountability from utilities. Edison had previously acknowledged that an idle transmission line was a "leading hypothesis" for the fire's ignition. Despite utilities formally withdrawing their opposition, the bill's failure raises concerns about "shadow lobbying" and the continued vulnerability of communities to wildfire risks from aging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The legal trade in human body parts in the US, where private companies acquire, dissect, and sell limbs for profit, is under scrutiny for its ethical implications and potential for exploitation. Unlike many European countries, US regulations allow charging "reasonable amounts" for "processing" body parts, leading to a flourishing industry that has made the US a global exporter of cadavers. Horror stories, such as a man's head being found after his body was donated for science, highlight the lack of oversight and legal recourse for affected families. Critics call for more regulation and public awareness campaigns for altruistic donations, as advancements in VR technology might eventually reduce demand.</p>
