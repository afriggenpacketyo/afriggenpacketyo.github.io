        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its scrutiny of student visa applicants by expanding social media vetting and pausing the scheduling of new appointments. This move is part of a broader crackdown on universities accused of failing to combat antisemitism amid pro-Palestinian protests. The State Department has directed embassies to cancel unfilled appointment slots for student visas, though existing appointments will be honored until further notice. Critics argue that these policies infringe upon free speech rights, while the administration asserts it is defending free speech and ensuring national security by carefully vetting entrants to the country. The situation is likely to cause concern among universities that depend on international students for funding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Nature suggests that fat cells have a 'metabolic memory' of obesity, making it easier for individuals to regain weight after losing it. Researchers analyzed fat cells in mice and humans, finding that even after weight loss, these cells continue to function abnormally, leading to inflammation and metabolic problems. While the study highlights the biological factors contributing to weight regain, experts emphasize that genetics, environment, psychology, and lifestyle also play crucial roles. Maintaining healthy habits such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and strength training can help counteract the biological predisposition to weight gain.</p>

          <p>In Gila County, Arizona, a region that heavily supported President Trump, many residents rely on Medicaid, creating a complex dynamic regarding potential cuts to the program. While there are concerns about government waste, many individuals and families depend on Medicaid for healthcare access, especially in rural areas with limited resources. The proposed cuts by House Republicans would affect millions, potentially reversing gains made by the Affordable Care Act. The debate highlights the tension between conservative values and the practical need for government assistance in healthcare, particularly in communities with high rates of disability and lower incomes.</p>

          <p>Economic uncertainty has led to a slowdown in both home sales and construction, creating a challenging environment for the housing market. Existing home sales are at a 16-year low for April, while builder confidence has dropped. High home prices and rising mortgage rates are pricing many potential buyers out of the market. Additionally, the ongoing tariff debate, particularly concerning Canadian lumber, is creating uncertainty for builders, making it difficult to price homes accurately.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the etymological journey of the word "pride," tracing its transformation from a negative connotation associated with arrogance and sin to a positive symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment. Originally denoting "inordinate self-esteem," pride was historically linked to the seven deadly sins in Christian theology. However, its meaning gradually shifted towards a sense of self-respect. The LGBTQ+ community adopted "pride" to counter negative stereotypes and assert their identity, influencing the rallying cry "Say it loud, gay is proud." Today, despite occasional debates, "pride" remains a powerful symbol of LGBTQ+ resilience and visibility, particularly in the face of increasing legislative challenges.</p>

Energy companies will pay over Â£70 million in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers fell short of required standards. The scandal, which emerged during the cost of living crisis, involved switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. A new code of practice with stricter conditions is now in place to prevent future unauthorized installations, and the government is reviewing Ofgem to reform the energy market.</p>

While some welcome the technology, others express concerns about increased surveillance and privacy. The move comes as shoplifting rates in the UK have risen sharply, costing retailers billions.

While the Metropolitan Police acknowledge that drug policy is a matter for parliament, opponents warn that decriminalization could send the wrong message about the harms of cannabis.

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million for breaches related to its sewage operations and shareholder payouts, marking the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat. The regulator cited rule violations regarding sewage management and deemed shareholder payouts "undeserved." The company is facing heavy criticism for its performance and is struggling with a Â£20 billion debt. The fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, although household water bills have recently increased. Ofwat has placed Thames Water under "cash lock up," preventing further dividend payments without approval.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to lift court-ordered restrictions on deporting immigrants to third countries. The administration argues that a federal judge's mandate requiring additional due process procedures has created a "diplomatic and logistical morass" and is hindering efforts to remove criminal aliens. The petition asserts that the detainees have already received adequate due process. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that all non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded "due process of law," though the specifics remain contested. The administration has been actively pursuing third-country agreements to remove unlawful or criminal immigrants.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to ban single-use vape pens in June to reduce waste and pollution. The ban applies to both online and retail sales of disposable vapes, regardless of nicotine content. Rechargeable and reusable vape pens will remain legal. The decision comes amid concerns about the environmental impact of disposable vapes, which contribute to plastic pollution and release harmful substances. While the ban may affect local businesses, the primary focus is on protecting the environment and promoting sustainable practices.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration seeks a nuclear deal with Iran, Israel is again raising the possibility of striking Iranian nuclear sites. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wary of a diplomatic solution, is pressing for military action. The tension has led to discussions between top U.S. and Israeli officials. Israel destroyed key elements of Iranâ€™s strategic air defense system. Netanyahu argues that Iranâ€™s vulnerability will not last long, and that the time is right for an attack.</p>
