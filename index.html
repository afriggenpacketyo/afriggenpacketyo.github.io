          <p>Retail sales experienced a significant drop of 0.9% in May, exceeding the anticipated 0.6% decrease, as reported by the Commerce Department. This decline, which follows a 0.1% decrease in April, reflects growing consumer unease amid tariff concerns and geopolitical tensions. Notable decreases were seen in building materials, gasoline stations, and motor vehicles, while online sales and furniture stores showed gains. Stock market futures remained negative following the report, and Treasury yields also decreased, indicating a cautious market response. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities seized a list of public officials from a home tied to Boelter, including detailed notes about Hortman.

          <p>According to China expert William Figueroa, China views the Iran-Israel conflict similarly to its stance on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, focusing on blaming Israel and calling for dialogue rather than military action. Figueroa stated that China lacks the capability for power projection in the Middle East and sees limited opportunity to exert influence. While China has facilitated negotiations in the region, such as the Saudi-Iran reconciliation, it is unlikely to mediate in the Iran-Israel conflict due to high costs and low potential gain. The situation poses some risk to China's energy security but is not considered a major threat.</p>

          <p>Baroness Casey urged the government to "crack on" with the inquiry into group-based child sexual abuse in England and Wales, calling for a "national reset" on the issue.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would not call Minnesota Governor Tim Walz after the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers, citing it as a "waste of time." Trump described the Democratic governor as "slick" and "whacked out," adding that he "doesnâ€™t have a clue." This decision contrasts with the typical practice of presidents reaching out to elected officials during times of tragedy. Walz was the vice presidential running mate for Kamala Harris, who lost her presidential bid to Trump.</p>
