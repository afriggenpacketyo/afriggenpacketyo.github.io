          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society announced a collaboration to publish a special collection of climate change research. This effort aims to ensure the scientists' work remains accessible, complementing the legally mandated National Climate Assessment, which the White House is reevaluating. The collection will consist of peer-reviewed scientific papers focused on climate change in the United States, open to any scientists wishing to contribute original work or reviews. This initiative seeks to provide critical science to support global climate change solutions, especially for those scientists affected by the administration's actions. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is implementing a policy requiring new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials before approval. This change mandates studies where half the participants receive a placebo to compare results against the vaccine, a practice already used but considered unethical by some when proven vaccines exist. It is unclear what HHS considers a 'new' vaccine, though updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation. Kennedy, who has long questioned vaccine safety, believes these trials are necessary to ensure vaccines do more good than harm, despite existing safety monitoring and reporting systems.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to regulate Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals in college athletics after a meeting with former Alabama coach Nick Saban. Saban expressed concerns that the influx of money is harming college sports and seeks reforms to create a more level playing field. Trump's potential intervention follows the NCAA's recent rule changes allowing colleges to pay athletes as a result of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit settlement. Senator Tommy Tuberville suggested Trump is uniquely positioned to regulate NIL, and Saban has previously called for federal legislation to ensure fairness across states. Optimism Score: 65</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming the university deserves it, though it is unclear if the IRS is acting on this. Harvard responded, stating there is no legal basis for such action and that it would endanger their educational mission, diminishing financial aid and medical research. This move is part of a broader pressure campaign against elite universities, painted by the administration as havens of antisemitism and discrimination.

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive Social Security Administration records. This request follows a federal judge's ruling in Maryland that imposed strict conditions on this access, citing privacy concerns.

          <p>Weekly measles cases in the U.S. have hit a new record, surpassing the peak of the 2019 outbreak, according to the CDC. The majority of cases stem from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, now larger than any since measles elimination in 2000. Despite a possible decline in new cases in Texas, officials remain cautious due to potential reporting delays and travel-related increases. The CDC and experts suggest this year's tally may be an undercount due to unreported and undiagnosed infections, with a higher severity rate compared to outbreaks in Canada. Optimism Score: 30</p>

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily from its Newark Liberty International Airport schedule after experiencing significant flight disruptions.

The flight cuts, amounting to about 10% of United's daily Newark schedule, aim to protect customers from further delays. Kirby mentioned that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers were absent after technology failures, urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports.

          <p>The article reviews the film 'April,' which follows Nina, an obstetrician in Georgia, who faces scrutiny after a tragedy in the delivery room and potential exposure of her clandestine abortions for women in need. The film eschews thriller conventions to focus on the oppressive gloom descending on Nina, whose inner life remains opaque. The realist style and strong visuals emphasize the cold procedural quality of Nina's work and her devotion to serving women in a patriarchal society. The director and star dramatize a cruel reality, making the film haunting and thought-provoking. Optimism Score: 50</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order to end government funding for the Corp. for Public Broadcasting, which he describes as "left wing propaganda," setting the stage for a likely court battle. The CPB argues that the president lacks the authority to cut off its funding, as Congress is responsible for such decisions. The order has drawn criticism from PBS and NPR executives, who vow to challenge it. Experts suggest the White House may face legal challenges due to viewpoint discrimination, while public media advocates emphasize the importance of local public radio and TV stations, especially in rural communities.

The U.S. and China remain in a standoff over tariffs, with China demanding the cancellation of tariffs on Chinese goods before engaging in trade negotiations.

The app Waltz used appeared to be a version of Signal with modifications from TeleMessage, which adds archiving capabilities but may undermine end-to-end encryption.
