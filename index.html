          <p>Pope Francis passed away at the age of 88 due to complications from a stroke and irreversible heart failure, according to the Vatican. The Catholic leader had a history of health issues, including respiratory illnesses and intestinal problems, which led to multiple hospitalizations in recent years. His health had been declining steadily, with a complex respiratory infection and kidney failure earlier in the year, ultimately culminating in his death at his Vatican residence. The Pope's death marks the end of a significant era for the Catholic Church.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, the "doomsday mom" convicted of murdering two of her children, presented her closing argument in an Arizona trial where she's charged with conspiring to kill her fourth husband.

The prosecution argues Daybell and her brother used their religious beliefs to justify the murder.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions of dollars in federal funding.

Harvard argues the funding halt will impede critical scientific and medical research, as well as diminish economic innovation.

          <p>The Trump Administration will resume collections on defaulted student loans on May 5, after a five-year hiatus. The Department of Education will notify borrowers in default, urging them to make payments or enroll in a repayment plan. Borrowers will be referred to a collections program run by the Treasury Department if they remain in default. Advocates worry about the impact on borrowers already facing economic uncertainty, especially older borrowers on fixed incomes, whose credit scores could be negatively impacted.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that the Trump administration's trade policies and attitude towards China are negatively impacting Nvidia and Apple. He asserts that the government is biased against these companies, believing Nvidia doesn't do enough to prevent China from accessing its products, and that Apple should manufacture its products in the U.S. Investors are hesitant to invest in these companies due to the government's actions, which are mandating weaker numbers. Cramer acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policies, making it difficult to predict the fate of Nvidia and Apple. (not investment advice)</p>
