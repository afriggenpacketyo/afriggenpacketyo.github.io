        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its anti-DEI campaign by sending letters to European companies with US government contracts, warning them to cease DEI programs or risk losing contracts.  The letters, distributed through US embassies, demand compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws and raise concerns about growing US-Europe tensions, particularly concerning trade and differing approaches to Ukraine. This action reflects a potential bias against DEI initiatives and may be seen as an attempt to exert political influence.</p>
