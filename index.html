          <p>Russia launched a significant drone and missile attack on Kyiv, injuring at least 17 people and damaging infrastructure, while a large prisoner swap involving up to 1000 inmates is underway between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian forces claim to have shot down a majority of the incoming missiles and drones. The prisoner exchange follows bilateral peace talks in Istanbul, with Russia proposing a draft for a sustainable settlement agreement. Ukraine's Defense Minister has expressed commitment to a ceasefire following the exchange, marking it as the first stage towards de-escalation. The exchange is the largest to date during the conflict.</p>

AWP's research indicates that the veteran suicide rate is higher than reported, with many deaths going unreported, and focuses on addressing the root causes of veteran dislocation.

          <p>China's internet watchdog, in collaboration with financial regulators, has shut down over a dozen social media accounts for spreading false financial information, illegally touting stocks, and promoting speculative cryptocurrency trading. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) reported that these accounts operated on popular platforms like Weibo, Douyin, RedNote, and WeChat. Some accounts misled investors with false information about capital markets, while others lured investors into paid groups with guaranteed stock wins. The crackdown aims to address concerns over financial influencers who use sensationalist claims to attract followers, misleading investors and disrupting the market.</p>

Experts testified that his activism and elevated profile put him at risk of assassination, kidnapping, or torture if deported to the Middle East. A federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation while considering whether his constitutional right to free speech was violated.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the Building Energy Act, aiming to dismantle key aspects of the previous climate protection measures. Reiche plans to abolish the operating ban on gas boilers installed before 1991, prioritizing energy supply alongside climate protection. While the installation of heat pumps has increased, Reiche intends to construct new gas-fired power plants, drawing criticism from energy experts who suggest alternatives like hydropower and large-scale batteries. Despite concerns, the government has committed â‚¬100 billion of a â‚¬500 billion infrastructure investment program to climate protection, showcasing a continued, albeit altered, focus on environmental issues.</p>

Under Ofcom rules, 93% of first-class mail must be delivered within one working day, but Royal Mail only achieved 76.3% in the year to March 2025. Royal Mail Chief Operating Officer Alistair Cochrane acknowledged the quality of service is not where it needs to be and reiterated the need for reform of the universal service obligation, requiring deliveries six days a week.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan's election as president of Romania was significantly influenced by the votes of ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship, who voted in record numbers. Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing substantially to his victory over hard-right candidate George Simion. This outcome is important for both Romania and Europe, as it demonstrates the preservation of liberal democracy and the continuation of Romania's Euro-Atlantic path. Despite Hungarian PM Viktor Orban backing the anti-Hungarian candidate Simion, Romania's ethnic Hungarians chose to support Dan, highlighting their commitment to democratic values.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's legal battle concerning his personal security arrangements in the UK has largely concluded after he lost his appeal against the government's decision to remove his police protection. The courts ruled that Harry misunderstood how the Royal Family's protection is organized and how his decision to step back from royal duties impacted his security status. The case centered on Ravec, the body responsible for Royal Family protection, which determined that Harry's new role as a non-working royal living outside the UK did not fit within its framework. The prince argued that his birthright made him a target, but the courts ultimately sided with the government's assessment.</p>

Key changes include larger habitats for elephants, an end to the long-term tethering of birds of prey, and prohibiting visitors from touching fish and cephalopods. Zoos and aquariums have a two-year timeline to adapt to these changes, which also require improvements in conservation standards and safety measures for dangerous animals.</p>

          <p>New farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the Japanese government plans to sell its stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. The reserve rice is expected to reach store shelves as early as June, addressing criticism that the government has failed to curb the price spike. Koizumi pledged to sell the grain directly to retailers, bypassing auctions that have hindered government control over prices, and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution.</p>

          <p>Many women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are hesitant to become pregnant due to the potential return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts when discontinuing contraceptive medication, the primary treatment for the condition. PMDD affects up to 8% of women and causes intense emotional and physical symptoms in the days leading up to menstruation, with an average diagnosis wait time of around 12 years. For women wanting to conceive, this poses a dilemma, as they must consider managing their mental health while trying to start a family. The Welsh government has expressed commitment to improving the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to navigate the complexities of global trade and tariffs, particularly those imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Salesforce has developed an AI agent that processes changes to U.S. customs tariffs, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to assess products and materials affected by tariffs.

          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of trucks into Gaza to provide humanitarian aid, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to insufficient supplies and logistical challenges. While nearly 200 trucks have passed through the Kerem Shalom crossing, critics argue this is a "drop in the ocean" compared to the 600 trucks that crossed daily during a previous ceasefire. Supplies are delayed at distribution points due to security clearance issues and logistical problems, including damaged roads and fuel shortages.
