          <p>The U.S. consumer price index held steady with a 2.7% annual increase in July, as lower gasoline and grocery costs helped offset other price hikes. However, economists are highlighting concerning underlying trends, such as a rise in core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Experts suggest that the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are creating inflationary pressures on certain goods and services, with effects that are expected to become more pronounced later in the year.

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 103,000 of its F-150 pickup trucks from model years 2023 to 2025 due to a potentially hazardous issue with the rear axle hub bolt. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, this bolt can fatigue and break, which could cause a vehicle to roll away when parked or lose power while driving. This defect significantly increases the risk of a crash, prompting the automaker to issue a recall for free repairs. This is the second time in recent years Ford has recalled F-150s for a similar axle bolt problem.</p>

          <p>President Trump has invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act to assume temporary control of the city's police force, citing an emergency that critics argue is non-existent given that crime rates are at a 30-year low. While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has little immediate recourse to challenge the action, the law itself provides a significant check on this presidential power. The statute explicitly limits federal control over the Metropolitan Police to a 30-day period, which cannot be extended without an act of Congress.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has submitted a surprising $34.5 billion bid to purchase Google's Chrome web browser, a figure that is higher than its own current valuation. The unsolicited offer comes after a U.S. court ruled that Google holds an illegal search monopoly, with the Department of Justice recommending the divestiture of Chrome to foster a more competitive market. Perplexity, which has secured backing from several investors for the potential deal, is positioning itself aggressively amidst a fierce battle for dominance in the generative AI space.</p>

Musk accused Apple of making it difficult for competing AI apps like his own, Grok, to gain visibility in the App Store. The public dispute is the latest flashpoint in a long-running feud between the two billionaires, which centers on Musk's belief that OpenAI has abandoned its founding principles by pursuing a for-profit model under Altman's leadership.</p>

This marks the first deployment of the Guard in the capital since the 2021 Capitol attack, a move Mayor Muriel Bowser described as "unsettling and unprecedented." The deployment was justified by the administration as a response to crime, though the mayor noted that violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene voiced "extreme frustration" with what she calls the "tone-deaf attitude" of Washington lawmakers, including those in her own party. In an interview, she argued that the GOP has abandoned its "America First" principles and is failing to address the concerns of regular Americans, such as the national debt and foreign aid spending. Greene advocated for cutting all foreign aid, withdrawing from NATO, and passing a balanced budget, expressing concern that current policies are harming younger generations.</p>

While CD rates are slightly lower than in previous years, they remain elevated and provide predictable returns without the risk associated with market fluctuations, making them an attractive vehicle for capital preservation.

          <p>European Union leaders have issued a unified statement declaring that a formal recognition of Russian sovereignty over conquered Ukrainian territory is unacceptable. The declaration comes ahead of a planned meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, amid concerns that a peace deal might involve ceding land to Russia. The EU stressed Ukraine's right to self-defense and its path to EU membership, underscoring European anxiety that allowing borders to be redrawn by force poses a direct threat to continental security.</p>

          <p>The UK's tax agency, HMRC, has confirmed it is using artificial intelligence to monitor the social media accounts of individuals under criminal investigation for tax evasion. While government investigators have long used social media, the process is now being partially automated to help identify discrepancies between a person's declared finances and their publicly displayed lifestyle. HMRC stated the technology supports its staff and is subject to human oversight, but experts warn of risks such as mistaken identity.</p>

          <p>The market for initial public offerings has surged since the stock market's low point in April, with the Renaissance IPO ETF returning nearly double that of the S&P 500. This rally has been fueled by investor enthusiasm for high-profile AI and cryptocurrency companies like Coreweave and Circle, which have seen substantial gains since going public. Analysts compare the current resurgence to the post-financial crisis recovery, suggesting a potential "return to normalcy" for the IPO market after a slow period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's military-backed takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force is being interpreted as a sheer demonstration of power rather than a response to a genuine crisis. The article argues that the pretext of "out of control" crime is demonstrably false, as crime rates in the city are at a 30-year low. Instead, the move is seen as a message to cities and states that do not defer to his will, eroding the taboo against using the military for domestic law enforcement and furthering an authoritarian political project.</p>

While the extension provides short-term relief, the underlying issues between the two economic superpowers are far from resolved, and future negotiations are expected to be challenging. Experts suggest that such extensions and adjustments will likely become a recurring feature of the relationship, as a comprehensive deal to end the trade dispute is not on the immediate horizon.

Experts note that while both offer higher yields than traditional savings, their features suit different needs. High-yield savings accounts are often ideal for building emergency funds due to their simplicity and potentially lower minimums. In contrast, money market accounts provide check-writing and debit card access, making them useful for managing cash flow on larger sums. (not investment advice)</p>

Another popular and tax-savvy option is to make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit that also satisfies the RMD requirement.
