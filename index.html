          <h2>Luigi Mangione's Attorneys Seek Dismissal in CEO Murder Case, Citing Double Jeopardy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 19:09:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment. They argue that concurrent state and federal prosecutions violate the Double Jeopardy Clause and Mangione's constitutional rights, claiming "prosecutorial one-upmanship" is at play. The attorneys also seek to suppress statements Mangione made in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested, alleging he was not properly advised of his Miranda rights. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges, with the latter potentially carrying the death penalty, and the defense argues that defending himself in the state case will remove rights afforded to him in the death penalty case.</p>

          <p>Two children and one adult were struck by a car outside a preschool at Sunrise Presbyterian Church in Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, in what authorities suspect may have been an intentional act. Police identified the suspect as Justin Collin Adams, who was apprehended after an hours-long manhunt that involved grid searches, drones, and checkpoints. One child and one adult were hospitalized, but their injuries were not as serious as initially feared, with both expected to recover fully.

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border have remained at historically low levels in April, marking three months since President Trump's immigration crackdown began. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, a slight increase from March but still among the lowest tallies in decades. The Trump administration attributes the drop to its policies, including rapid deportations and increased troop deployment, reversing many Biden-era programs. While some criticize these policies as inhumane, experts note that tougher rhetoric and actions may be deterring migrants, though migration patterns can change rapidly.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, as part of a European breeding program to increase genetic diversity. The female lynx has been moved to an enclosure in Germany's Black Forest, where it will be monitored to assess its survival skills and ability to avoid human interaction. If successful, the lynx will be released to help control deer populations and restore the ecosystem's balance, as lynxes were driven to extinction in the UK centuries ago. The decision on the lynx's fate will be made later in the summer after close monitoring.</p>

          <p>The US is set to close the "de minimis" loophole, a trade rule that allowed retailers to ship low-value packages (under $800) to US customers without duties or taxes. This change, supported by both Presidents Trump and Biden, aims to tackle illegal imports and protect American businesses, potentially increasing prices for consumers using online retailers like Shein and Temu. While these retailers have already started raising prices, the move could also impact border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole has surged in recent years. The UK and EU are also considering similar measures, which could lead to price increases for consumers globally.</p>

"Thunderbolts*" is praised for its complex characters and strong performances, particularly by Florence Pugh, who plays a Russian assassin grappling with her past. "Rosario" is highlighted for its use of real-world religious elements to create a frightening atmosphere, while "La Balada de Hortensia" is noted for its positive portrayal of a cross-dressing character who helps women facing discrimination. The article emphasizes the importance of diverse voices in film and celebrates the arrival of new Latin American directors in the horror genre.</p>

          <p>A 400-page report from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) questions the current approach to healthcare for transgender children, which is endorsed by major medical associations and involves gender-affirming care like puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The report, commissioned under an executive order titled "Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," argues that doctors providing gender-affirming care are not prioritizing the health interests of young patients. Medical professionals and advocacy groups have criticized the report for misrepresenting the medical consensus and relying on narrow data, raising concerns about its potential impact on access to care for transgender youth.</p>

          <p>Apple expects tariffs on imported goods to add approximately $900 million to its costs in the current quarter, despite exemptions on key electronics. The company is responding by shifting production of iPhones for the American market to India, and moving production of iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods to Vietnam. While Apple is emphasizing its investments in the US, the primary beneficiaries of this supply chain shift are India and Vietnam, not the US, as China will remain the primary country of origin for products sold outside the US. Despite the anticipated financial hit, Apple's sales remain strong, with revenues up 5% year-on-year.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has received his first salary raise in a decade, bringing his base salary to $1.5 million, a 49% increase from 2024. This adjustment reflects Nvidia's exceptional growth, driven by the demand for its GPUs in artificial intelligence, which has turned it into one of the world's most valuable companies. Huang's total pay for 2025, including stock awards, amounts to $49.9 million, with the compensation committee citing internal pay equity as a factor in the decision. Huang's roughly 3.5% stake in Nvidia is currently valued at approximately $94 billion.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is implementing a new policy to expedite the filing of felony charges in sexual assault and family violence cases, prompted by a report highlighting delays in a case involving a 13-year-old boy's sexual assault and murder. The policy mandates that once a decision is made to seek an arrest warrant, the process to file a criminal complaint must begin within one business day. This change aims to address a backlog of cases that contributed to delays in charging Mario Edgardo Garcia-Aquino, who is now accused of the boy's murder, despite previous allegations of sexual misconduct. The district attorney's office confirmed that the backlog was a factor in the delay, leading to criticism from the victim's family and calls for accountability.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's return to the White House is casting a shadow over the Australian federal election, forcing candidates to address international relations rather than focusing solely on domestic issues. Trump's tariffs and unpredictable foreign policy have raised concerns about Australia's relationship with the US, its key ally. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has criticized Trump's tariffs, the need for a strong US alliance, particularly in the face of China's growing influence, is making Australia's leaders re-evaluate their links to the US. Some analysts suggest Trump's actions may even be helping Albanese by creating a sense of crisis and rallying voters around the incumbent.</p>

          <p>Chris Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) who was targeted by President Trump for defending the integrity of the 2020 election, has had his Global Entry membership revoked. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Krebs is "under active investigation by law enforcement agencies," which disqualifies him from the program. This action follows a memo from Trump directing the suspension of security clearances held by Krebs and individuals associated with him, as well as an investigation into his activities while in government. Krebs, now a CBS News cybersecurity expert, was fired by Trump in 2020 for refuting claims of widespread voter fraud.</p>

The review notes that the film is less polished than other Marvel movies, with a plainness to the fights, but it finds inspiration in the nightmare fuel of after-school PSAs and explores themes of trust and trauma.
