          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with a video purportedly showing the persecution of white Afrikaner farmers, a claim Ramaphosa disputed. Trump also referenced claims of white "genocide" in South Africa, which have been widely discredited, and stated that white farmers are being killed and their land taken. Ramaphosa countered that violence affects black people more and emphasized his government's commitment to racial reconciliation, also pointing out the white members of his delegation. The exchange highlighted tensions between the two nations, exacerbated by Trump's offer of refugee status to Afrikaners earlier in the year. The meeting was originally intended to focus on trade relations, but shifted to Trump's amplification of right-wing claims about South Africa. ()</p>

          <p>The Trump administration attempted to deport eight migrant detainees, including individuals from Myanmar and Vietnam, to South Sudan, prompting a federal judge to state that the administration had "unquestionably" violated a court ruling blocking deportations to third countries without due process. The detainees, who had serious criminal records, were placed on a flight that officials declined to confirm the final destination of, citing operational and safety concerns. Judge Brian Murphy ordered the administration to retain custody of the deportees and provide them with "reasonable fear" interviews, criticizing the administration for not offering an opportunity to object to their removal. The detainees remain in U.S. custody following the ruling. ()</p>

The directive to the Fire Department to activate the sirens was also deemed ambiguous, causing further delay.

          <p>The Trump administration withdrew from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, just before the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death. Minneapolis officials expressed dismay, emphasizing the importance of oversight to address the department's history of unconstitutional practices. The city remains committed to implementing the changes outlined in the agreement. This decision reflects a broader shift away from federal intervention in local policing matters. ()</p>

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, ceding sovereignty of the Chagos Islands but leasing back a strategically important military base for 99 years in exchange for a multi-billion pound payment. The deal, which had been delayed due to changes in government and concerns about US national security, will allow the US and UK to continue operating the base on Diego Garcia. Representatives of the Chagossian community will meet with a government minister to discuss the sovereignty of the territory. ()</p>
