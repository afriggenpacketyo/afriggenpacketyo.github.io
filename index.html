          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators is urging the Trump administration to cease funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and resume support for UN-led aid distribution. In a letter, they express grave concerns over the GHF's operations, which have been linked to hundreds of civilian deaths, and question the bypassing of normal oversight for the private group. Citing a dire humanitarian crisis with widespread starvation, the senators are demanding transparency and a return to established aid mechanisms to prevent further loss of life and ensure aid reaches those in need.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation highlights how routine hospital drug screenings are upending the lives of new mothers due to a high rate of false positives. One Alabama mother temporarily lost custody of her children after a test, likely triggered by poppy seeds on a bagel, came back positive for opiates. The report finds that many hospitals are required to alert child welfare authorities after an initial positive result, before a more accurate confirmatory test can be conducted. This practice can lead to traumatic family separations and lengthy investigations, even when the initial result is proven incorrect.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in populated areas of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to be distributed more safely. This move comes amid mounting international pressure and severe warnings of famine, with images of emaciated children sparking global outcry. While the UN has welcomed the step, it reiterates that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the crisis effectively. The pause is intended to create secure land routes for aid agencies to tackle the deepening hunger crisis affecting the Palestinian population.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to discuss the urgent humanitarian situation in Gaza during his upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump. The discussion is expected to cover US-led efforts to secure a ceasefire and the critical need to increase aid delivery to the starving population. This diplomatic engagement occurs as Israel faces intense criticism from allies over the crisis, with aid agencies stating that current measures like airdrops are insufficient. The meeting underscores the growing international pressure on Israel to lift all restrictions on aid and prevent further catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys' newly acquired quarterback, Joe Milton, has spoken highly of his new team's environment, particularly praising the leadership of starting quarterback Dak Prescott. In his comments, Milton appeared to criticize the atmosphere at his former team, the New England Patriots, noting the stark difference in how teammates support each other. He described Prescott as going out of his way to offer help, a level of support he implied was absent in his previous locker room.

This heightened sense of productivity and accomplishment contributes significantly to overall well-being, reducing stress and burnout.

Some younger investors express concern that Gen X and Millennials could be left as "bag holders" if there isn't enough new investment to absorb the assets being sold off by retirees. However, other market observers argue that this demographic shift has been ongoing for over a decade without causing a crash, and that wealth will be recirculated through inheritance and spending.

          <p>A seasoned travel writer with experience in 70 countries outlines seven common phrases that can make American travelers sound rude or ignorant. These include asking for prices in U.S. dollars, commenting on how cheap things are, and assuming all countries have states. The writer advises against seeking out American chains like Starbucks instead of supporting local businesses and warns that complimenting someone's English can be perceived as patronizing. The advice emphasizes the importance of cultural awareness and respect to avoid being seen as an "obnoxious American" while traveling internationally.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Malaysia for talks aimed at ending a deadly border dispute that has killed at least 34 people and displaced over 168,000. The meeting follows a push from U.S. President Donald Trump, who spoke with both leaders and urged a ceasefire. While both sides have agreed to the talks, fighting has continued along the contested border, with each country blaming the other for the ongoing hostilities. The negotiations, facilitated by Malaysia as the current chair of ASEAN, represent a critical effort to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>After years of turmoil, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of stabilizing under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company a year ago. The manufacturer's aircraft production and delivery numbers are improving, and it expects to be cash-flow positive in the second half of the year, with analysts predicting a return to annual profitability in 2026. Despite ongoing challenges, including FAA production caps and scrutiny following a January door-plug incident, Ortberg's hands-on approach has been credited with beginning to change the company's troubled culture and restoring some confidence among customers and investors.</p>

The signs, placed near struggling hospitals in four states, blame Trump for gutting rural healthcare through massive cuts to Medicaid enacted in his recent legislation. The bill cut over $1 trillion from the public health insurance program, which is a critical financial lifeline for many rural hospitals.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's economic policies and anti-market rhetoric are inadvertently fueling a resurgence of socialist ideas in America. The author contends that by favoring insiders, engaging in cronyism, and attacking free exchange as a system of exploitation, Trump's "ersatz capitalism" discredits the very market principles he purports to represent. This, combined with growing economic dissatisfaction, has created an opening for politicians who champion state-led solutions. The piece suggests that to counter this trend, proponents of market economics must address the system's current failings and cleanse it of corruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic analyst explains that the practice of tipping in the U.S. has its roots in the post-Civil War era, when employers in the service sector, particularly the restaurant industry, sought to avoid paying wages to newly freed Black workers. This system was later codified with the creation of a lower "tipped minimum wage," currently $2.13 per hour at the federal level. This policy places the responsibility of paying the bulk of a worker's wages directly on the customer. Consequently, failing to tip is not just withholding a bonus for good service, but effectively denying a worker their expected earnings.</p>
