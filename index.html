          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) has lowered its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, marking the fourth cut in the last six meetings, as the country grapples with political uncertainty and the potential impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. South Korea faces ongoing political turmoil following a botched attempt by the former leader to impose martial law, along with economic challenges including a GDP contraction in the first quarter. The central bank attributed the rate cut to expectations of declining economic growth and stable inflation, while also slashing its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%. The Kospi stock index jumped 1.25% following the announcement, while the South Korean won weakened 0.71% against the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields," revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move has sparked anxiety across university campuses in the United States and may lead to reprisal from China, which sends the second-largest group of international students to the U.S. American universities and research laboratories have benefited from talented students from China and other countries, and many universities rely on international students paying full tuition for a substantial part of their annual revenue. The State Department will also not give visas to foreign officials who engage in censorship of the speech of American citizens.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles officials are facing significant challenges in preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovery from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and concerns about federal funding. The city is also bracing for potential worker and supply shortages as preparations intensify, and economists fear a recession could dampen ticket sales. Mayor Karen Bass and Olympics organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman remain confident the Games will succeed and boost the city, pointing to the 1984 Olympics as a past triumph over economic hardship. Despite these assurances, concerns persist about the fires, federal funding, and immigration policies potentially hindering the Games' success.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 while already serving a 200-year state sentence for a 1973 murder. His attorneys expressed gratitude, noting Hoover's nearly 30 years in solitary confinement and perceived rehabilitation efforts, while the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial voiced disappointment, emphasizing the severity of Hoover's crimes and his continued criminal enterprise from prison. The article includes statements from Hoover himself from a 1993 interview, as well as reactions from former gang members and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that trade turbulence and global supply chain constraints will significantly slow the growth of China's aviation capacity, with an average annual increase of only 3.1% until 2028, compared to the 15.4% average in the decade leading up to 2019. Remaining duties on imports from the U.S. could increase the cost of Boeing jets by millions of dollars, making Chinese airlines hesitant to import them in the short term. Amid trade tensions, some Chinese airlines have already refused to accept deliveries of Boeing planes, though deliveries reportedly resumed after a cooling of the tariff war earlier this month. These factors are expected to contribute to potential delivery delays and order cancellations by Chinese airlines.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a key aspect of his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, though the Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling. Dow futures jumped 500 points upon the announcement, and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses.</p>

Revoking visas from Chinese students is also another blow to the American higher education system, from which the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars of funding.

          <p>An unsealed F.B.I. intelligence memo offers details on the bureau's assessment that some Venezuelan government officials likely facilitated the migration of members of the Tren de Aragua gang to the United States, aiming to undermine public safety. The memo, submitted to a federal judge in Texas, contrasts with the majority of the nation’s intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, which disagree with the F.B.I.’s analysis. This dispute centers on President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people accused of being members of the gang to a Salvadoran prison without due process. The National Intelligence Council has issued assessments stating that the F.B.I.'s view is based on statements of migrants arrested in the United States, which the majority of the intelligence community deems not credible.</p>

Community organizations and law offices report a surge in naturalization applications among Latinos in 2025, spurred by the Trump administration's policies and ICE operations.

Despite this political tension, Nvidia's growth continues to be fueled by high demand for its artificial intelligence chips.

Reform made significant gains in recent local elections, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies has questioned the feasibility of Farage's tax plans, estimating they could cost between £50bn and £80bn a year without clear funding sources.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, suggested that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ahead of a fourth round of tariff talks in Washington, stating that while tariff negotiations and security matters are based on different logic, such purchases are within the scope of the talks. Japan hopes to schedule an in-person summit between Ishiba and President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June. Ishiba has pledged to support the U.S. in its efforts to revive the shipbuilding industry.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced his departure from his role in the Trump administration after criticizing the president's tax bill, stating he would return to his business ventures. Musk, who led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), thanked President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending, though he had criticized Trump’s spending plan. He had also butted heads in private with some cabinet-level officials and publicly attacked White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. Trump and DOGE have managed to cut nearly 12% of the federal civilian workforce, and Musk's political activities have drawn protests and some investors have called for Musk to leave his work as Trump’s adviser and manage Tesla more closely.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, while the attorney general of New York welcomed the decision, stating that no president has the power to single-handedly raise taxes whenever they like.</p>

However, due to the "safe third country agreement," their initial attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge were denied. After multiple detentions and legal interventions, the family eventually succeeded in entering Canada, but their story reflects stricter border policies and rising numbers of migrants being turned away.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, stating that federal law does not grant him "unbounded authority" to tax imports from nearly every country. The ruling, by the U.S. Court of International Trade, undercuts his primary leverage in pressuring other nations to strike trade deals beneficial to the United States. The court found that Mr. Trump’s tariffs “exceed any authority granted” to the president by the emergency powers law. The Trump administration has immediately filed its plans to appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>

This allows them to expedite the planning process, though completion could still be over a decade away, and may override local objections. Experts warn that household water consumption may need to fall amidst rising temperatures and population growth. The announcement aims to streamline the planning process and secure water supply for future generations, but building reservoirs is costly and may impact local communities.</p>
