          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, has been returned to the United States to face criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts related to a conspiracy to transport migrants from Texas. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked the Salvadoran President for Abrego Garcia's return, with his attorney claiming that the government had the power to bring him back at any time. Federal prosecutors are seeking pretrial detention, citing a danger to the community and risk of flight, and if convicted, Abrego Garcia faces a maximum punishment of 10 years' imprisonment for each alien he transported.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked lower court orders that required the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to release information about its work and personnel. The order prevents DOGE from having to turn over records to a government watchdog group as part of a lawsuit. The underlying issue concerns whether DOGE is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, with CREW arguing that DOGE wields substantial independent authority, making it a de facto agency. The Trump administration argues that DOGE is a presidential advisory body that makes recommendations to the president and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long battle for justice following the 1979 murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly impacted victims' rights. Catina was killed by her former boyfriend, Steven Burns, on her first day of college after she attempted to break up with him. The family's experience with the parole system led them to advocate for changes in California law, including allowing victim impact statements at sentencing and ensuring children have support when testifying. Despite Burns' repeated attempts at parole, the Salarno family has consistently fought to keep him behind bars, turning their personal tragedy into a catalyst for broader change.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mark Dybul, who led George W. Bush's PEPFAR program to combat AIDS, expresses concerns about its future due to proposed funding cuts. President Trump has requested Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid, including $400 million allocated to PEPFAR. These cuts would drastically reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases, potentially reversing the progress made in saving lives and building health systems. Dybul emphasizes that while PEPFAR was not intended to be a permanent program, these cuts could lead to the loss of significant gains.</p>

The ICC has criticized the measures as an attempt to undermine its independence, while the US claims the ICC is politicized and infringes upon its sovereignty.
