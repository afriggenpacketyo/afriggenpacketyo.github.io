          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have signed an open letter defending Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the central bank's institutional independence. The letter comes in response to President Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Cook from her position over unproven allegations of "mortgage fraud," an action the signatories argue undermines the U.S. financial system. The economists emphasize that the Federal Reserve was designed to be insulated from day-to-day politics to ensure credible monetary policy, pushing back against the administration's claims of lawful removal.

          <p>Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan, known for co-creating "Father Ted," was arrested at Heathrow Airport upon arriving from the U.S. on suspicion of inciting violence through his posts on the social media platform X.

The arrest has sparked a debate on free speech, with critics like Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling the police action "totally disproportionate" and an "absurd infringement."</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, whose firm Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in Kraft Heinz, expressed his disappointment with the company's decision to split into two separate entities. The move effectively unwinds the major 2015 merger that Buffett helped orchestrate, which he admitted did not turn out to be a brilliant idea. Following his comments, shares of Kraft Heinz fell over 5%, reflecting investor concern over the food conglomerate's future and the separation of its iconic brands like Oscar Mayer from its sauces and meals divisions.

          <p>A magnitude-5.2 aftershock has struck eastern Afghanistan, complicating rescue efforts just two days after a powerful earthquake killed over 1,400 people and injured more than 3,000. The initial quake devastated remote villages in Kunar province, where landslides have blocked roads, forcing rescuers to use helicopters to search for survivors trapped under rubble. The Taliban government has appealed for international aid, with the UN releasing emergency funds to address the urgent need for food, water, and shelter for thousands affected by the disaster.</p>

          <p>A devastating landslide has destroyed the village of Tarseen in Sudan's western Darfur region, with local groups reporting as many as 1,000 people killed. Many of the victims were internally displaced people who had fled Sudan's ongoing civil war and were already facing starvation. The region, controlled by the neutral Sudan Liberation Movement-Army, had become a refuge for those escaping fighting and famine, but heavy rains triggered the landslide, leaving only one known survivor in the leveled village and compounding the nation's massive humanitarian crisis.</p>

The majority of this capital, over $1 billion, will be directed toward exploration and production in an effort to address a growing domestic gas deficit. The country is facing a projected 20% shortfall by 2026, a situation linked to reduced exploration under President Gustavo Petro's policies aimed at transitioning away from fossil fuels, making new investment critical for the nation's energy supply.
