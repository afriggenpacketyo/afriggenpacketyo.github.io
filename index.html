            <p>Following international criticism, Israel launched an internal investigation into the March mass killing of 15 Palestinian paramedics in Gaza. The investigation revealed 'professional failures' and breaches of orders by the Israeli military, citing an 'operational misunderstanding' and poor night visibility as contributing factors. While the probe found no evidence of execution, it did determine that a commanding officer would be remanded and a deputy commander dismissed. The investigation also claimed that six of the victims were members of Hamas, a claim that has not been backed up by evidence, but the findings have sparked controversy and accusations of a whitewash, especially in light of prior incidents involving attacks on aid workers.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump issued two Easter messages, one extending well wishes and the other targeting 'Radical Left Lunatics' who he claims are endangering the country through open border policies. Trump accused Biden of allowing criminals into the U.S. and criticized 'WEAK and INEFFECTIVE Judges and Law Enforcement Officials' for enabling what he sees as a sinister attack on the nation. He also referenced the Biden autopen controversy and alleged cheating in the 2020 election, concluding his message with sarcasm. The remarks come amid pushback against the administration's plans to deport violent criminal illegal aliens under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.</p>

            <p>Border czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 gang member, despite a court order protecting him from deportation. Homan criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for visiting Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of supporting a public safety threat. Homan argued that due process rights are more limited under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which was invoked to deport Abrego Garcia. This defense came hours before the Supreme Court temporarily halted the use of the act to deport Venezuelans being held in Texas, raising questions about the administration's approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

Inspired by Novak Djokovic's strategy against Alcaraz, Rune focused on making his opponent play a high volume of shots. This victory is Rune's most significant since the Paris Masters in 2022 and signifies a return to form after an illness-related retirement in Monte Carlo.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump is reportedly interested in attracting wealthy immigrants to the United States through an expansion of the 'golden visa' scheme. This initiative, which offers residency in exchange for investment, aligns with Trump's focus on economic gain and efficiency. While many view citizenship as more than a commodity, Trump's proposal reflects a market-driven approach to immigration, aiming to generate revenue and stimulate the economy. The current U.S. golden-visa scheme is considered cumbersome and underpriced, prompting discussions about potential reforms.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are exploring investment in a massive natural gas project in Alaska to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs and meet trade demands from President Trump.

The Trump administration views the project as a strategic priority, potentially reducing the U.S. trade deficit and enhancing energy security for Asian allies. The project has garnered interest from multiple Asian countries and is expected to begin construction in late 2026, with full commercial operations starting in 2031.</p>

            <p>Officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have revised the death toll from a recent boat fire, stating that 33 people died, far fewer than the previously reported 148. The incident occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers near Mbandaka, with the boat believed to have been carrying around 400 people. The mayor of Mbandaka attributed the discrepancies in the death toll to 'confusion.' Congolese police believe cooking onboard the vessel ignited the deadly blaze. Boat accidents are common in Congo due to overcrowding and lack of safety measures.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, a refurbished tech marketplace, reports a tripling of sales following President Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting consumers are opting for used devices to avoid higher prices on new electronics. While most smartphones and computers are manufactured in China, which faces high tariffs, the CEO believes this presents an opportunity to shift consumer habits towards refurbished options. Analysts agree that prolonged tariffs could lead to a significant increase in sales of used devices. However, it remains uncertain whether this shift will be temporary or long-lasting, as consumer preferences for new devices may eventually prevail.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an appeal from the ACLU. The court ordered the Trump administration not to remove the detainees until further notice, citing concerns about due process. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the act without providing individuals the opportunity to challenge their cases in court. The White House responded by claiming that the men being held were 'foreign terrorists,' while the ACLU expressed relief that the Supreme Court intervened to prevent their deportation.</p>
