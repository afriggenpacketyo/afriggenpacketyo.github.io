            <p>Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley faced a barrage of questions from constituents at a town hall meeting concerning the Trump administration's policies. Concerns were raised about the administration's refusal to comply with court orders regarding the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador. Constituents also voiced worries about the impact of Trump's tariff policies on Iowa farmers, with Grassley acknowledging potential drawbacks but refraining from definitive judgments. The senator defended his votes for Trump, stating he doesn't agree with any president 100%.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's deportation efforts have ensnared undocumented immigrants with no criminal records, challenging the president's promise to focus on serious criminals. Many of those being deported have American-born children, pay taxes, and contribute to their communities. The deportation push is expected to intensify, with ICE officials facing pressure to meet arrest and deportation goals. The administration's actions have drawn criticism, even from some of Trump's supporters.</p>

            <p>A homeowner in Chicago reduced her gas heating bill by half or more by investing in energy-efficient upgrades, including insulation and air sealing. She also received a $1,200 federal tax credit for the improvements. The tax credit, worth up to 30% of the cost of qualifying projects, is currently at risk of being eliminated by Republicans in Congress. However, savings on utility bills are often a primary motivation for homeowners, regardless of tax incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's press conference with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele is analyzed as an authoritarian political performance, particularly regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The article contrasts Bukele's strongman tactics with the more subtle approach of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. Trump's administration is seen as attempting to implement both styles of authoritarianism, which could inflame resistance to his policies. The author suggests Trump lacks the core strengths of both leaders, potentially undermining his efforts.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a policy to fast-track immigration court cases by allowing judges to dismiss "legally deficient asylum cases without a hearing." This policy change, outlined in a memo, could lead to asylum denials based solely on the asylum request form. The directive aims to reduce the immigration court backlog amid increased deportation efforts. Critics argue this could harm those without legal aid and lead to unjust deportations.</p>
