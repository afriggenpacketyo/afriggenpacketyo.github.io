          <p>Two fathers, David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar, are running the London Marathon to honor their daughters, Alice and Elsie, who tragically died in a dance class in Southport last year along with Bebe King. They are raising money for charitable projects established in their daughters' memories. Stancombe is supporting Elsie's Story, which provides grants to young people, while Aguiar aims to build a new playground at Churchtown Primary School dedicated to Alice and Bebe. The community is rallying behind them, with family and friends attending the marathon to show their support for the runners and the lasting legacies of the girls.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with wounded veterans in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump noticed a "Let's Go Brandon" sticker on one of the veteran's belongings, leading to a moment of laughter. The phrase originated in 2021 as a euphemistic chant critical of President Biden. Trump expressed gratitude to the veterans and their families, with one veteran expressing support for the administration's energy and commitment to fulfilling promises. The event also marked the rollout of new executive orders focused on education initiatives.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at an airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law, Seo, was hired by Eastar Jet in exchange for the airline's CEO leading a state-funded agency. Seo allegedly received approximately $150,000 in salary and housing support between 2018 and 2020, which prosecutors claim constitute bribes intended for Moon. This indictment comes amid a series of prosecutions against officials from Moon's administration, with his party condemning the move as politically motivated.</p>

The company will introduce Labubu 3.0 at a higher price point in the US ($28) compared to mainland China (99 yuan or US$13.50) to protect its profit margins. Pop Mart is also shifting more production to Vietnam to mitigate the impact of tariffs. The company believes it can command higher prices overseas due to its positioning as a high-end brand targeting adult buyers.</p>

          <p>Uvalde city leaders have approved a $2 million settlement for the families of the victims of the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting. The settlement includes financial compensation, enhanced training for city police officers, expanded mental health services, an annual day of remembrance, and a permanent memorial. The settlement will be spread among the 21 families of the victims killed, and the city hopes that this agreement will enable families who lost so much and the city they call home to continue that process.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg stated that China has stopped taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to the ongoing trade war with the United States. This has led Boeing to consider reallocating some aircraft intended for Chinese airlines to other customers. Despite this setback, Ortberg expressed confidence in the demand for Boeing's 737 Max planes and the company's ability to manage the situation. The CEO's comments came after Boeing reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the first quarter.</p>
