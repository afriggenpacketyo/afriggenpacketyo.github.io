            <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML reported lower-than-expected net bookings, citing uncertainty from new U.S. trade restrictions as a potential drag on demand for its chipmaking machines. Despite this, CEO Christophe Fouquet maintains a strong demand outlook, driven by artificial intelligence, and estimates 2025 revenue between 30 billion and 35 billion euros. Analysts suggest the impact of U.S. tariffs on ASML could be widespread, but it is too early to quantify the effects on the semiconductor supply chain. The U.S. Commerce Department is conducting a national security investigation into semiconductor technology imports, potentially leading to additional trade measures. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A study by University College London indicates a decline in disposable vape use in the UK, particularly among 16-24 year olds, following the announcement of a government ban effective June 1, 2025. Overall vaping use has stalled, with young adults showing a significant shift away from disposable vapes, potentially switching to refillable and rechargeable options. The ban aims to reduce littering and address rising rates of youth vaping. Health officials emphasize vaping as a smoking cessation tool but caution against its use by non-smokers, especially young people, due to potential detrimental effects on concentration and brain development.</p>

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court is set to rule on a legal challenge concerning the definition of a woman, focusing on whether a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate can be legally considered a woman under equality laws. The case stems from a 2018 Scottish law requiring 50% female representation on public boards, which included transgender women in its definition of women. The challenge, brought by For Women Scotland, argues that the law's redefinition of "woman" exceeds parliamentary powers. The ruling could have U.K.-wide implications for sex-based rights and single-sex services.</p>

            <p>President Trump is facing criticism for defying a Supreme Court order to facilitate the return of a Maryland resident, Armando Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The administration's refusal to comply with the court's ruling has raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis and the separation of powers. Experts are divided on the severity of the situation, with some arguing that Trump's actions pose a significant threat to the rule of law, while others believe the judiciary still has tools to enforce its rulings.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) issued a cease and desist order against Google for violating anti-monopoly laws regarding search services on Android devices. Google was found to have required Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements, hindering competition. The JFTC stated that Google required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model. This action aligns with similar regulatory crackdowns on Google in the UK and the U.S.</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly restricts access to President Trump for news agencies, including the Associated Press, following a court ruling that the administration had improperly banned the AP. The new policy limits pool coverage for small spaces and gives the press secretary greater control over who can question the president. Critics argue that this move is an attempt to control coverage and discriminate against certain viewpoints. The White House Correspondents' Association has expressed concern that the administration is unwilling to guarantee it will not continue viewpoint discrimination.</p>
