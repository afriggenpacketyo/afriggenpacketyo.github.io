          <p>Federal authorities arrested a Wisconsin judge and a former New Mexico judge for allegedly obstructing Trump administration immigration enforcement. Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE after a courtroom appearance. Former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano and his wife face charges related to harboring an undocumented immigrant suspected of gang ties. These actions mark a significant escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to remove undocumented immigrants, drawing condemnation from Trump's critics who see it as an attack on the independent judiciary.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the Department of Justice (DOJ) will rescind the Biden-era policy protecting journalists from being compelled to reveal sources in leak investigations. Bondi argues the previous policy was abused, with officials leaking sensitive information for political gain and using "media allies." The move follows criminal referrals of intelligence community professionals accused of leaking classified information. Critics argue this change threatens the freedom of the press, while Bondi asserts it is necessary to stop illegal leaks that undermine national security. Optimism score: 50</p>

Accounting errors and overstated savings have also been highlighted, raising questions about the accuracy of Doge's claims.

The change aims to protect classified and sensitive information. First Amendment advocates fear the move will stifle journalism, given Trump’s confrontational approach to the press. The vague phrasing of the new memo suggests a broader scope than simply restoring past policy. Optimism score: 40</p>
