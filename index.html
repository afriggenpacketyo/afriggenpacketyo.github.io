          <p>According to sources, a brief outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for approximately 60 to 90 seconds, preventing controllers from communicating with aircraft. The incident led to significant delays, exacerbating existing issues due to short-staffing, runway construction, and adverse weather conditions in the New York City metro area. Newark was the world's most delayed airport on Monday morning, highlighting the severity of the disruptions caused by the outage and compounding pre-existing issues. </p>

          <p>The Greek government has launched "Kids Wallet," a state-operated mobile application designed to help parents monitor their children's screen time and verify their age on digital platforms and social networks. Digital Governance Minister Dimitris Papastergiou emphasized that this tool empowers parents to protect their children online, confirming their ages when using social media. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed concerns about technology's impact on family life, supporting the initiative which sets the age for parental consent at 15, with the app's use being voluntary. The app integrates with government services and allows parents to restrict app access and set daily time limits, aligning with EU plans for enhanced online protection for minors.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democrats, is anticipated to become Germany's next chancellor following his party's election victory in February. The Bundestag is set to decide on May 6, after all parties in the proposed government agreed to a coalition agreement laid out in early April, marking a significant moment in his unconventional political career. Despite never holding a top governmental office with leadership responsibilities, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and the SPD, mediating between their interests. Merz, a commercial lawyer from Sauerland, is described as a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer," potentially making him well-suited for the current times.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures closed at their lowest level since 2021, falling about 2% after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second consecutive month. The decision to hike output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly triple Goldman Sachs' forecast, exacerbated fears of a potential oversupply in the market. Concerns about a recession due to U.S. President Trump's higher tariffs further dampened demand for oil, contributing to the biggest monthly loss in oil prices since 2021. Consequently, oilfield service firms anticipate a decline in investment in exploration and production due to the weak price environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooting at El Camaron Gigante restaurant in Glendale, Arizona, resulted in three deaths and five injuries after a fight broke out between at least two groups of people. The incident occurred at around 7:45 p.m. during a Cinco de Mayo event, with police believing multiple shooters were involved and considering it an isolated event between individuals known to one another. The victims killed were three men aged 17, 21, and 29, while those injured included two women, two men, and a 16-year-old boy, some of whom were hit by shrapnel, and the restaurant expressed devastation over the tragic event. Bystanders described a chaotic scene as gunfire erupted, prompting people to run for safety, while police continue to investigate the circumstances leading up to the violence.</p>

Hosted by an array of Black celebrities, the event's proceeds will support the Costume Institute, the only department that raises its own budget.

          <p>Nineteen states and Washington, D.C., have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the layoffs of thousands of Health and Human Services (HHS) staffers. The lawsuit argues that these job cuts, which disproportionately affect the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, are an attempt to "dismantle" HHS. States claim the layoffs have disrupted access to data and grants, impacting worker safety and Head Start programs, while also forcing the closure of key disease testing labs. The suit seeks to halt the reorganization and job cuts, asserting they exceed HHS's legal authority and violate the separation of powers doctrine.</p>

Known for his long-term focus, Buffett eschewed Wall Street's chicanery and treated his duty to shareholders as a sacred trust, earning comparisons to J.P.

Walrath will be sentenced to 15 years in prison and five years of post-release supervision, admitting to beating Brooks in the groin and placing him in a chokehold. District Attorney William J. Fitzpatrick described the attack as a violent initiation into life at the prison, calling it a "welcome to Marcy." The attack, recorded by officers' body cameras, revealed disturbing details of the beating, prompting calls for broader reform in the state prison system.</p>

The Israeli strike targeted the port, described by the military as a main source of income for the Houthi regime, as well as a concrete factory east of the city. This action is part of an ongoing exchange between Israel and the Houthis, who have been launching missiles and drones at Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Houthis have also been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claiming an attempt to blockade Israel, although many of the vessels have tentative Israeli ties.</p>

          <p>A shifting perception of the United States amid President Trumpâ€™s trade war is prompting Europeans to pivot decisively away from U.S. goods and services, according to a new assessment by the European Central Bank. The study found that Europeans are actively moving away from U.S. products and brands, regardless of cost, in response to newly imposed tariffs and political tensions. This shift signals a potential long-term structural change in consumer preferences, with some Europeans using apps to avoid buying American and canceling subscriptions to U.S. streaming services. As a result, U.S. companies and investors are closely monitoring international markets for signs of anti-American sentiment.</p>

Buffett revealed that Greg Abel, vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will succeed him as CEO, with the board unanimously approving the transition on January 1, 2026, while Buffett remains as chairman. Despite the share drop, analysts view the transition as positive, expecting Buffett's continued mentorship and intellectual contributions to benefit Berkshire.

          <p>The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change on the agency recovering overpayments that sparked concerns it could cause financial hardship for tens of thousands of beneficiaries. In an April 25 "emergency message" to Social Security employees, the agency said it is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%. The change comes after SSA on March 27 started recovering erroneous overpayments to Social Security recipients by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up shaply from the prior rate of 10%. The agency's move to recover overpayments has long been a pain point for thousands of beneficiaries who are overpaid each year, with many people unaware they had received a bigger benefit than they were entitled to until receiving notices from the Social Security Administration.</p>

          <p>Debt management programs, offered by credit counseling agencies, consolidate unsecured debts into one manageable monthly payment, potentially lowering interest rates and fees. To qualify, applicants typically need eligible debts like credit cards and personal loans, sufficient income to make monthly payments, a meaningful level of debt, and willingness to close credit cards. If ineligible, debt settlement, debt consolidation loans, or bankruptcy are alternative options. The most important thing is to take action â€” whether that's working with a credit counselor, exploring other debt relief options or creating a structured plan on your own.</p>

Critics argued the plan is an attack on the rule of law, with Senator Scott Wiener calling it an attempt to turn Alcatraz into a domestic gulag. The Bureau of Prisons said the prison, which was open for only 29 years, had â€œno source of fresh water, so nearly one million gallons of water had to be barged to the island each week.</p>
