          <p>Thousands of people have participated in anti-immigration rallies across major Australian cities, including Sydney and Melbourne, under the 'March for Australia' banner. These demonstrations, which were promoted by some opposition politicians and far-right figures, were met with significant counter-protests, leading to several clashes between the opposing groups. The Australian government has strongly condemned the rallies, with ministers labeling them as hateful and divisive efforts that seek to undermine the nation's social cohesion. The events occur amid a noted rise in right-wing extremism in the country, which recently prompted the government to criminalize the Nazi salute with mandatory prison time.</p>

          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly accused the club of breaking its promise to let him leave and is demanding a transfer to Newcastle United before the deadline. In a social media statement, Wissa claimed the club is "unduly standing in his way" after rejecting two offers from Newcastle, the latest reportedly worth up to £40 million. He stated that Brentford had previously agreed in writing not to obstruct his departure if a reasonable offer was made but has now significantly increased its asking price. Wissa, who has not been training with the first team, is urging the club's owners to honor their commitment.</p>

Xi stated that the two nations should be partners, not rivals, while Modi noted a new "atmosphere of peace and stability" between them. This meeting marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, occurring amid ongoing border disputes and trade tensions with the United States affecting both countries. As a sign of improving relations, Modi announced that direct flights between India and China, which were suspended in 2020 after deadly border clashes, would resume.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the death of an infant from whooping cough, marking the first such fatality in the UK this year. The baby's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during her pregnancy, a measure recommended to provide passive immunity to newborns before they can receive their first jab at eight weeks old. This tragic event highlights growing concerns from health officials about declining vaccination rates in the country, with none of the main childhood vaccines reaching the 95% uptake target required for herd immunity. Officials are urging pregnant women and parents to follow vaccination guidelines to prevent further severe cases.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has condemned ongoing nationwide protests over social and economic inequality, labeling some actions as bordering on "treason and terrorism." The demonstrations, which have occurred in major cities, intensified after a motorcycle taxi driver was killed by a police vehicle during a protest. The unrest has included deadly violence, with at least three people killed after a council building was set on fire in Makassar.

          <h2>Analysts Question if Trump's Presidency is Normalizing Autocratic Behavior in the US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political observers and activists are expressing growing concern that the Trump administration is normalizing autocratic practices within the United States. This article cites several examples, including calls to arrest political opponents, the revocation of Secret Service protection for a rival, and large-scale immigration raids. Some political scientists argue that the U.S. is becoming a "competitive authoritarian system," following a familiar pattern of consolidating power seen in other nations. While some believe the trend can be reversed, others suggest it's an acceleration of pre-existing flaws in American democracy, where the system was designed with a capacity for authoritarianism that is now being exploited.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order to prevent city police from collaborating with any National Guard troops or federal agents deployed by President Trump. The order is a direct response to Trump's threats to send federal forces to Chicago to address crime, a move Mayor Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have called unconstitutional. The order specifies that Chicago police will not assist with patrols, arrests, or immigration enforcement conducted by federal personnel. Mayor Johnson emphasized the city's intent to protect its sovereignty and prevent actions like families being separated or citizens being harassed by federal agents without local consent.</p>

The request comes as Gen Z and millennials, who now form the largest part of the labor force, navigate adulthood marked by economic uncertainty, from recessions to the pandemic. Despite being on track for higher educational attainment, these generations are less likely to believe in the American dream, with many citing difficulties in finding jobs and affording housing. The median age of a first-time homebuyer has risen to 38, up from 28 in 1991, reflecting the significant financial barriers they face.</p>

          <p>In a significant blow to the renewable energy sector, the Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for port infrastructure to support the offshore wind industry. The decision affects 12 port projects across the country, from California to Virginia, which were intended to become hubs for the construction and deployment of large offshore wind turbines. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the projects as "wasteful," stating the funds would be redirected to other port upgrades. Critics of the move, including Democratic Representative Jared Huffman, condemned the decision as an attempt to destroy a clean energy sector, eliminate jobs, and increase electricity costs for consumers.</p>

This announcement aims to quell a recent public outcry from motorists who have complained about performance issues and the lack of choice at fuel stations, where E20 has become the only available option.

          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the complex undersea topography of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea could be used to create a submarine "kill zone." The research focuses on using "acoustic shadow zones," areas around submerged mountains where sonar is ineffective, as ideal hiding spots for intelligent sea mines. According to the study, placing these advanced weapons in sonar dead zones would enhance their concealment, allowing them to evade detection and selectively target enemy vessels. This strategy could challenge existing undersea warfare dynamics by creating highly effective and difficult-to-detect maritime threats in the contested region.</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha has created a significant supply shortage, causing prices for the powdered green tea to skyrocket even in its home country of Japan. The boom is attributed to matcha's growing reputation as a superfood, its popularity on social media platforms like TikTok, and a post-pandemic tourism influx. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the last decade, with much of it being matcha bound for the U.S. The intense demand is straining Japan's aging farming communities and production capabilities, leading retailers to ration supplies and major companies like Ito En to create dedicated divisions to manage the crisis.</p>

Some analysts, like those at UBS Global Wealth Management, remain optimistic, predicting the bull market will continue due to a potential economic soft landing and solid earnings. Others are more cautious, pointing to underlying weaknesses in the U.S. economy and predicting a slowdown in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The Reform-led county council imposed a sweeping ban on the local newspaper, the Nottingham Post, and its affiliated reporters, accusing them of spreading "misinformation" about a local government reorganization proposal. The author draws a direct parallel between this action and the Trump administration's practice of restricting access for journalists and outlets that publish critical coverage. The move is seen as part of a broader hard-right strategy to bypass traditional media, create a foil, and avoid scrutiny of local governance.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old British Formula 1 fan, Brandon Burgess, is undertaking an ambitious challenge to attend every one of the 24 grands prix in the current season on a budget of just £20,000. To make the feat even more challenging, he is only using his 28 days of annual leave from his full-time job. Burgess is documenting his journey across five continents, staying in budget accommodations like capsule hostels and strategically planning his travel to minimize costs. Having completed the European leg of the season, he is currently on track with his budget but faces the most expensive part of the calendar with upcoming flyaway races in Singapore, Las Vegas, and Abu Dhabi.</p>

          <p>Labor unions and activists are organizing a series of protests across the Los Angeles area for Labor Day under the banner "Workers over Billionaires." The demonstrations are a response to what organizers call a refusal to let billionaires divide working people, cut essential services, and scapegoat immigrants for profit. The planned actions come as unions face significant challenges, including protecting members from the Trump administration's immigration policies and a weakened National Labor Relations Board. Protests are scheduled in numerous locations, including Culver City, Torrance, Wilmington, and Long Beach, continuing the tradition of labor activism on the federal holiday.</p>

          <p>The recent imposition of 50% tariffs by the United States on Indian goods is creating a new economic dynamic that may push India and China toward a stronger relationship. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the SCO summit is seen as a potential turning point. Experts suggest that despite their deep-seated rivalry and border disputes, the two Asian economic powerhouses may seek to enhance cooperation to counter their dependence on the U.S. and reshape global trade flows. This pragmatic alignment could lead to eased trade restrictions and renewed Chinese investment in India.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 6-1 to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a game plagued by sloppy mistakes and a lack of offensive support for starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow pitched a no-hitter into the sixth inning but ultimately took the loss, continuing a 152-day winless streak despite consistently strong performances. The Dodgers' offense failed to capitalize on opportunities, and the team made several critical errors, including a runner being thrown out at home plate and multiple defensive miscues. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration, stating the team "beat ourselves" with an "unrecognizable" and unfocused performance that allowed their division lead to shrink.</p>

          <p>Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun has declared his ambition for the Tron blockchain to handle more transaction volume than the Swift international banking system within the next five years. Sun stated that Tron, which is widely used for stablecoin transactions, is already on track to facilitate US$8 trillion in transactions this year and could eventually handle volumes 100 times larger than Swift. He highlighted Tron's ability to process transactions in seconds compared to the days it can take for Swift transfers. This reflects his confidence in the growing influence of blockchain technology in reshaping global finance and asset transfers.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters have marched in cities across Mexico, demanding government action and justice for the more than 130,000 people who are officially registered as missing. Relatives of the disappeared, many of whom have formed their own search parties called "buscadores," carried placards with photos of their loved ones and called for an end to the crisis. The vast majority of these disappearances have occurred since 2007, largely linked to the country's violent drug wars, with both cartels and security forces being implicated. The demonstrations highlight what the United Nations has called "a human tragedy of enormous proportions."</p>
