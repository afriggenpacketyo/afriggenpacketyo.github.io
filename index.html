          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM," distinguishing itself as a technology company rather than a bank. The company generates revenue from interchange fees on Chime debit and credit card purchases, with banks passing on a portion of these fees to Chime. As of March, Chime reported 8.6 million active members, a 23% year-over-year increase, and an average revenue per active member of $251, up from $231. This move comes amid market volatility that has caused other companies to delay their IPO plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite public denials from the Israeli government about extreme food shortages, an internal analysis suggests a severe crisis is imminent in Gaza if food supplies are not restored, according to The New York Times article. Israeli military officials privately warn of widespread starvation among Palestinians unless the blockade is lifted promptly. This assessment contrasts with Israel's public stance that the blockade poses no major threat to civilian life, while aid agencies report dwindling supplies. The United Nations' World Food Program has exhausted its food stocks, and bakeries and charity kitchens are shutting down, exacerbating the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the cost of flour has increased dramatically.</p>

          <p>The stock market has rebounded to pre-tariff levels, but investors remain cautious due to uncertainty surrounding final tariff levels, according to The New York Times article. Despite stocks rising and government bond market volatility subsiding, investors are struggling to assess the economy's direction. The latest Consumer Price Index reading showed slower inflation in April than expected, but some believe tariff-fueled inflation may take months to appear in economic data. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, holding off on interest rate cuts until the inflationary impact of tariffs is clearer, which contributes to ongoing market uncertainty.

          <p>Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has announced that players' ineligibility from the game ends upon their deaths, effectively removing Pete Rose and other deceased players from MLB's permanently ineligible list.

Manfred stated that a deceased person no longer poses a threat to the integrity of the game, and the policy change was prompted by an application filed by the family of Pete Rose.

          <p>Despite repeated vows from President Trump not to cut Medicaid, a Republican bill aims to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. The bill proposes work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $715 billion over the next decade but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. Trump has maintained he is only looking for "fraud" and "abuse" in the program, but critics argue the bill breaks his promises to protect Medicaid.</p>

Hogg claimed the vote is linked to his dispute with the party over his support for primary challengers to Democratic incumbents.

Urologists note that such nodules can be benign, resulting from inflammation or nonthreatening conditions like nodular benign prostatic hypertrophy. However, they can also indicate cancer, necessitating further testing such as PSA tests, urine tests, MRI, or ultrasound. Doctors emphasize the importance of discussing treatment options with patients of Mr. Biden's age due to the slow-growing nature of prostate cancers and potential complications from treatment.</p>

          <p>The latest inflation report indicates cooling prices, but gold prices have remained strong, breaking records, according to a CBS News article. While gold is typically a hedge against inflation, its relationship is complex and influenced by geopolitical tensions, central bank demand, and interest rates. Geopolitical tensions and recession fears are driving demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. Analysts suggest gold prices could reach $3,500 to $3,800 by year-end, but short-term volatility may occur. (not investment advice)</p>
