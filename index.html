          <h2>Elon Musk's Starbase Inches Closer to Becoming Official Texas City</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 21:26:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in South Texas overwhelmingly approved the incorporation of Starbase as an official city, fulfilling Elon Musk's long-held ambition. The area, home to SpaceX's rocket program, is located near the Mexico border and houses many of Musk's employees. The creation of Starbase raises concerns about Musk's control over the area, potentially impacting beach access and local governance. The company has stated the city status is needed to manage roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for its residents and streamline launch operations, which requires beach closures, but critics fear the move will prioritize company interests over public access and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions during his first 100 days in office have sparked shock and insult among European allies, particularly regarding trade and NATO. His rhetoric and tariff policies have created uncertainty for businesses like Burgundy winemakers, while his stance on NATO's defense spending has shaken the alliance. While some agree with Trump's call for increased European defense spending, there are fears that the Trump administration may abandon them, undermining one of the greatest alliances in modern history.</p>

The decision effectively suspends VoA's broadcasting while the case is resolved, as the court deferred to the executive branch on employment matters. The ruling does not affect the funding freeze for other broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which are private non-profit organizations.</p>
