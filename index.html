          <p>This article provides an overview of current savings account interest rates, noting a national average of 0.38% while high-yield savings accounts offer significantly more, between 4.11% and 4.30%. It advises consumers to consider high-yield accounts, particularly from online banks which tend to have lower overhead costs and thus offer better rates and fewer fees. To secure the best returns, the article recommends comparing various account options, paying attention not only to the interest rate but also to potential fees that could diminish earnings over time.

          <p>Elon Musk's company Neuralink identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing, a designation typically for firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals that can grant preferential access to government contracts. This filing occurred shortly before a funding round valued the brain-computer interface developer at $9 billion, raising questions and scrutiny given Musk's status as the world's wealthiest person. The Department of Justice has previously penalized companies for making false claims about this status, adding a layer of potential legal risk to the controversial declaration.</p>

          <p>In response to public pressure and recent media reports, President Donald Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move follows a Wall Street Journal report about a letter from Trump found among Epstein's belongings. However, legal experts note that releasing grand jury testimony is rare and faces significant legal hurdles, and critics argue that these transcripts would represent only a fraction of the total evidence and may not satisfy public demands for full transparency.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to the White House's pointed questions regarding the budget overruns for the renovation of the Fed's headquarters in Washington. In a measured letter, Powell directed critics to a new public webpage with project details and refuted claims of luxurious amenities, such as a private elevator or rooftop garden. This exchange occurs within the broader context of a sustained pressure campaign by the Trump administration, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the central bank's refusal to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump includes a "no tax on tips" provision, but many questions remain about its implementation and scope. The policy is not a complete tax elimination but rather a deduction of up to $25,000, and it is still subject to payroll and state taxes. Tax professionals and workers are awaiting clarification from the IRS on which specific occupations qualify and how the deduction will function, especially with recent changes to income reporting thresholds for forms like the 1099-K, creating uncertainty for many in tipped professions.</p>

          <p>With U.S. inflation rising to 2.7% in June, the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates soon has diminished, creating an extended opportunity for savers. The article suggests that a short-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a smart financial move, as it allows individuals to lock in currently high interest rates while maintaining flexibility. Because rate cuts are not imminent, savers have more time to shop for the best CD terms, adapt to changing economic conditions, and still earn hundreds of dollars in interest on a substantial deposit.

          <p>The U.S. consulate in the Chinese city of Wuhan has suspended all visa interview services, citing "unsafe" indoor temperatures that exceeded 33°C (91°F). In a public notice, the consulate blamed the building's management for routinely delaying the activation of air conditioning, creating hazardous conditions for both visa applicants and staff. The consulate stated that services will not resume until they can ensure the health and safety of all individuals on the premises, apologizing for the inconvenience and allowing for appointments to be rescheduled.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the profound ethical questions facing top AI engineers, who are being offered nine-figure salaries to develop technology that leaders in the field warn could pose an existential risk to humanity. It argues that the race for superintelligence, driven by intense competition and immense financial incentives, often sidelines crucial safety considerations. The author concludes that working at a frontier AI lab is ethically questionable unless one has a clear, defensible plan to mitigate these dangers, as no amount of money is worth hastening a catastrophic outcome.</p>

          <p>An analyst from HSBC has doubled the price target for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock, forecasting a potential 37% increase in its value. This bullish outlook is driven by the belief that AMD's latest MI350 series of AI chips are powerful and competitively priced enough to seriously challenge Nvidia's market dominance. The investment bank anticipates that this will lead to a significant surge in AMD's data center revenue, projecting it to reach $15 billion by 2026, far exceeding current Wall Street consensus estimates.

With hundreds reported killed, including dozens of civilians summarily executed, residents are trapped in their homes, describing horrific scenes of bodies in the streets and feeling abandoned by all sides.</p>

          <p>Sir Grant Shapps, the former UK defence secretary, has defended the government's decision to use a "super-injunction" to keep a massive data breach secret. The breach inadvertently exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had worked with British forces, placing them at severe risk of retaliation from the Taliban. In his first interview on the matter, Shapps argued that the extreme measure of gagging the media was "entirely justified" because his primary focus was on preventing those on the compromised list from being hunted down and killed.</p>

Citing personal experiences with prejudice, the writer suggests that Mamdani's rise, while a threat to the political establishment, also presents an opportunity to challenge and dismantle these harmful, institutionalized biases.</p>
