        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the market anticipating Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, certain stocks in sectors like housing, finance, and consumer goods are expected to benefit significantly. Companies such as Home Depot, Capital One, and Bristol Myers Squibb could see positive impacts as lower borrowing costs stimulate economic activity, from home remodeling to consumer spending. The effectiveness of these cuts hinges on whether bond yields, which influence mortgage rates, also decline. This analysis suggests that a lower-rate environment could make dividend stocks more attractive and boost loan activity, benefiting a range of businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed close contacts that she will not seek a third term in the 2026 election, with a formal announcement expected soon. Sources indicate that Ernst, who has served since 2015 and risen to a leadership position within the Republican conference, intends to enter the private sector, having fulfilled her goal of serving two terms. Her decision adds to a growing list of Senate Republicans not seeking reelection, a development that concerns White House officials hoping to maintain party strength. Several Iowa Democrats have already initiated campaigns for the anticipated open seat.</p>

          <p>A record $30 billion is expected to be legally wagered by Americans on the upcoming NFL season, marking an 8.5% increase from the previous year, according to the American Gaming Association. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for a surge in activity, but they face increasing competition from both established rivals and unlicensed offshore operators. In response to the threat from illegal sportsbooks, which cost states an estimated $4 billion in tax revenue, law enforcement and attorneys general are intensifying crackdown efforts. Recent data suggests that states actively enforcing against illegal operators see higher growth in their legal betting markets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially canceled the Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, effective September 1. This protection had been extended beyond the standard six-month post-office period by a previously undisclosed approval from the Biden administration. The decision comes as Harris prepares for a tour to promote her upcoming memoir, "107 Days," which details her short presidential campaign. A senior advisor stated that Harris is grateful for the Secret Service's dedication, while the context includes recent calls from the current administration for increased security for public officials.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, under the Trump administration, has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for a dozen offshore wind infrastructure projects. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy labeled the projects as "wasteful," stating the funds will be redirected to upgrade ports and other maritime infrastructure. The largest affected project is the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind terminal in California, which lost approximately $427 million in support.

          <p>The Trump administration's push for a "pro-American" version of history, exemplified by a review of the Smithsonian's celebration plans, is part of a wider political effort to control the nation's historical narrative. This article argues that the conflict exposes a critical weakness in the U.S. education system: the decades-long devaluation of liberal arts in favor of STEM and vocational training. This shift has left citizens without essential skills for self-government, such as critical thinking, historical literacy, and empathy. The author contends that restoring the liberal arts to the center of education is crucial for safeguarding democracy against propaganda and fostering a capable citizenry.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed several key issues, including the recent leadership turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which he described as a necessary shakeup. Johnson also indicated a potential House floor vote to compel the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files if it becomes necessary, though he suggested recent document handovers might make it moot. Following the Minneapolis school shooting, he expressed openness to bipartisan solutions focusing on mental health rather than new gun control legislation. Johnson also defended President Trump's major tax and spending bill, asserting its benefits for all Americans despite polling to the contrary.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal ruling has permitted the government to continue housing asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel in Epping, providing a technical legal victory for the Home Office. The decision prevents a wave of similar legal challenges from other local councils that could have disrupted the asylum accommodation system. However, the ruling places the Labour government in a politically difficult position, as it had to argue in favor of using hotels, a policy it has pledged to end. Political opponents, including Reform UK and the Conservative party, are now criticizing the government for prioritizing migrants over local communities, creating further pressure ahead of the autumn political season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has informed Congress that his administration will not spend $4.9 billion in previously approved foreign aid, utilizing a rare maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." This tactic involves proposing to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that Congress does not have the required 45 days to act, causing the funding to lapse. The move, last used in 1977, effectively cuts the budget without legislative approval and targets funding for the State Department and USAID. This action aligns with the administration's policy of reducing foreign aid but could provoke a significant clash with Congress over constitutional spending authority.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is confirmed to be attending a military parade in China, marking his first participation in a multilateral event with other heads of state. The visit is significant as it coincides with the 80th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule on the Korean peninsula. Kim will be among 26 foreign leaders at the event, a gathering that analysts suggest could signal a strategic realignment between Beijing and Pyongyang. Both China's foreign ministry and North Korea's state news agency have confirmed the visit, though further details about the itinerary have not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prohibit doctors at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from performing abortions, even in cases of rape and incest. The draft rule, which also forbids counseling on pregnancy termination, allows an exception only when the mother's life is directly endangered. This proposal reverses a 2022 Biden administration policy that expanded abortion access for veterans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Critics, including female veterans and abortion rights advocates, argue the rule is cruel and unsafe, potentially forcing women to wait until they are near death to receive care.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that a large portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee will be returned to the library at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The painting, which depicts an enslaved man holding Lee's horse, was removed in 2022 following a law mandating the removal of Confederate commemorations from military installations. This move aligns with President Trump's and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's efforts to restore Confederate symbols, framing their removal as an erasure of history. The decision has sparked controversy, as it appears to challenge the spirit of the 2020 legislation passed after nationwide protests for racial justice.</p>

Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga on June 21 has elevated the practice to a symbol of Indian national identity on the world stage. Through collaborations with international organizations and the promotion of traditional knowledge systems, India is leveraging yoga to build people-to-people ties and project a non-threatening, civilizational influence. However, this global expansion has also led to criticism regarding over-commercialization, cultural appropriation, and its use in domestic political agendas.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber made history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming the 21st player in MLB history to achieve the feat. In his final at-bat, he had a chance to be the first-ever to hit five but popped up against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the lopsided 19-4 game. This outcome averted a potential controversy, as a record-breaking fifth home run against a non-pitcher could have been viewed as illegitimate. The increasing use of position players to pitch in blowouts has become a contentious issue in baseball.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, showed that prices rose at a stable annual rate of 2.6% in July, matching the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, ticked up slightly to 2.9% from 2.8% in June, its highest level since February. The data also revealed a strong 0.5% increase in consumer spending from the prior month, indicating continued economic resilience. These figures suggest that while overall inflation has cooled significantly from its peak, underlying pressures remain, supporting the Fed's cautious approach to potential interest rate cuts.</p>

The object's strange brightness, retrograde orbit nearly aligned with Earth's, and close flybys of multiple planets are statistically unlikely coincidences. While acknowledging that the object is almost certainly a natural phenomenon like a comet, Loeb's thought experiment applies the "dark forest hypothesis" to analyze its behavior as if it were an extraterrestrial probe. This methodology, he argues, could be useful for analyzing future interstellar visitors, regardless of their origin.</p>
