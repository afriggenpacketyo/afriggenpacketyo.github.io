          <h2>US Credit Card Debt Reaches $1.21 Trillion, Matching Previous High Amid Rising Delinquencies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 14:41:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that U.S. credit card balances have climbed to $1.21 trillion, equaling the all-time high set last year. This increase is accompanied by a rise in delinquency rates, with 6.93% of balances transitioning into delinquency, particularly straining subprime borrowers. Analysts suggest this trend reflects consumers overextending themselves due to post-pandemic inflation and high borrowing costs. While many households are managing, a significant portion faces financial precarity, with a job loss or medical emergency potentially leading to serious trouble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has officially ended the requirement for federal employees to document five weekly accomplishments, a practice initiated by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. OPM Director Scott Kupor stated that managers have other tools to stay informed about their teams' work and the agency will no longer manage the process. The directive, issued in February as part of an effort to reduce the federal workforce, had been met with resistance from multiple agencies. The policy was largely phased out after Musk, who had threatened termination for non-compliance, left his government role in May.</p>

          <p>A contentious political battle is unfolding in Texas, where Republicans are attempting a rare mid-decade redrawing of congressional maps that could net them up to five House seats. With the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House, this move has significant national implications for the 2026 midterm elections. In response, Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to deny a voting quorum, prompting the governor to order their arrest. The conflict has escalated, with Democratic governors in California and New York threatening to counter with their own partisan redistricting if the Texas plan proceeds.</p>

          <p>Fox News contributor Steve Hilton has announced his intention to launch a legal battle against a plan by California Democrats to redraw the state's congressional maps before the next census. Hilton argues the move is an unconstitutional power grab designed to gerrymander districts and undermine Republican voters, violating both the state constitution's once-a-decade rule and the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. He contends that any new map drawn without updated census data would be based on guesswork, especially given significant population shifts. Hilton vows to challenge the plan in both state and federal court to ensure fair representation.</p>

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs economist, the labor market is already showing early signs of disruption from generative AI, with young technology workers being the most affected. While widespread AI adoption is still pending, a noticeable pullback in tech hiring has occurred over the last three years, deviating from a two-decade growth trend. Unemployment rates for tech workers aged 20-30 have jumped by three percentage points since the start of the year. This suggests companies are delaying hiring for junior roles that are more susceptible to automation, signaling a potentially painful transition for certain segments of the workforce.

          <p>Tennessee has executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate convicted of a 1988 triple murder, despite legal challenges and medical concerns over his implanted heart defibrillator. Witnesses reported that Black appeared to be in pain shortly after the lethal injection began, raising questions about whether the device caused additional suffering. His attorneys had argued for the device to be deactivated to prevent unnecessary pain, but a court overturned the order. This case has drawn attention to the ethical complexities of executing inmates with complex medical conditions and pre-existing health issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent remarks on potential successors to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have caused significant movement in prediction markets. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, referring to them as "both Kevins are very good." Following his comments, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave both Hassett and Warsh a 35% chance of being nominated. The speculation comes as Trump continues to criticize current Chair Powell for maintaining high interest rates, signaling a desire for a new leader more aligned with his economic policies.

Violent crime overall fell by 4.5%, and property crime, including a significant 18.6% reduction in motor vehicle thefts, also saw a substantial decline. While experts note this continues a downward trend from post-pandemic highs, they also point out that aggravated assaults remain elevated compared to pre-2020 levels. The report reflects a broad improvement in public safety statistics, though hate crime incidents saw only a slight decrease.</p>

          <p>Warwickshire Police have refuted claims made by a local council leader that the force covered up details regarding a reported sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. Chief Constable Alex Franklin-Smith stated that the force's priority was supporting the victim and that they would not conceal such criminality. The response came after Reform UK council leader George Finch alleged the two men charged were asylum seekers and accused the police and Home Office of withholding this information. The police confirmed they follow national guidance by not releasing immigration status at the point of charge.</p>

          <p>In a novel approach to wildlife management, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly using audio from a heated argument scene in the film "Marriage Story" to haze wolves and prevent them from attacking cattle in Oregon. According to the Wall Street Journal, the agency deploys drones that, upon detecting wolves, shine spotlights and blast alarming sounds, including the dramatic dialogue between actors Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. This unusual tactic is part of a broader "wolf hazing" strategy that also uses sounds of fireworks and gunshots. Early results suggest the method has been effective in reducing livestock predation.</p>
