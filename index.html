          <h2>Music Industry Grapples with Rise of Viral AI-Generated Artists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:06:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The music industry is facing a new challenge with the emergence of AI-generated artists like "The Velvet Sundown," which has amassed over a million monthly listeners on Spotify. While platforms like Suno and Udio make creating music easier than ever, many human artists and industry professionals express concern over copyright infringement, market saturation, and the potential for AI to devalue human creativity. Major record labels have filed lawsuits against AI music platforms for alleged mass copyright infringement, highlighting the growing legal and ethical battles surrounding this new technology. The trend is forcing a conversation about authorship, compensation, and the future of music in an increasingly automated world.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:05:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, a move championed by President Trump to reduce spending. The legislation, which passed on a narrow 51-48 vote, includes significant cuts to foreign aid programs and eliminates over $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. While an amendment successfully preserved funding for the U.S.-backed HIV/Aids program, PEPFAR, other efforts to maintain international aid levels were rejected. The bill now returns to the House of Representatives, where its passage is uncertain due to the changes made in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chase Childers, a 38-year-old former professional baseball player, tragically died on Sunday while attempting to save a group of swimmers caught in a rip current off Pawleys Island, South Carolina. Childers, who was briefly signed by the Baltimore Orioles and later served as a police officer, entered the water to help but became the only one who did not return to shore. His body was later recovered after a search involving local authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard. Officials are urging caution and planning to evaluate new safety measures, including better education for tourists about the dangers of powerful rip currents in the area.</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, dropped after President Donald Trump announced he had persuaded Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the announcement immediately impacted the market, with ADM's stock falling and raw sugar futures rising. The Corn Refiners Association warned the switch could cost thousands of American manufacturing jobs and increase reliance on foreign sugar imports. The situation highlights the significant influence presidential statements can have on corporate decisions and market behavior, even before official policy changes are enacted.

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The meeting descended into chaos as Democrats protested Chairman Chuck Grassley's refusal to allow all members to speak or to consider a motion to hear from a Justice Department whistleblower who has accused Bove of unethical conduct. All Democratic members walked out in protest before the vote proceeded along party lines. Bove's nomination has been controversial due to his work for Trump and allegations of misconduct, and his confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that first-generation migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than their native-born counterparts, a gap that shrinks but persists into the second generation at 7.7%. The research, published in the journal Nature, indicates the disparity is not due to unequal pay for the same job but rather to structural barriers that limit migrants' access to higher-paying sectors and roles. The report compared Germany to eight other Western nations, finding that countries like Canada are more successful at closing this gap. To improve integration, the study recommends better language support, recognition of foreign qualifications, and expanded professional networks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has experienced a record number of flood warnings in 2025, with deadly flash flooding events becoming increasingly common this summer. Experts attribute this trend to several factors, including a warming atmosphere that holds more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall. Additionally, aging infrastructure in many cities, such as sewer and drainage systems, was not designed to handle the volume of modern deluges. Increased population density and urban development, which reduce the ground's ability to absorb water, also exacerbate the problem. These elements combine to create more frequent and destructive flash floods, a trend that climate scientists predict will continue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050 are raising alarms among former federal officials. They warn that the push to fast-track plant approvals by overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) threatens the regulator's independence and could jeopardize public safety. The orders criticize the NRC for "risk aversion" and mandate strict deadlines for approvals, which former NRC chairs argue ignores the complexities of new reactor technologies. Critics draw parallels to the Fukushima disaster, where a lack of regulatory independence was a key factor, and express concern that weakening the NRC could lead to similar catastrophic mistakes.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic details an incident where James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, was barred from attending the graduation ceremony for a CIA bomb-sniffing dog he had sponsored and named after his late wife. The decision was reportedly a result of a Trump administration executive order that stripped Clapper and other former officials of their security clearances after they signed a letter regarding Hunter Biden's laptop. The story is presented as an example of the administration's personal and vindictive approach to perceived political adversaries, often referred to as the "deep state."

          <p>Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn (DB), is experiencing a severe crisis with train punctuality at a historic low, with only 62% of trains considered on schedule. The problems stem from decades of underinvestment in the country's aging rail infrastructure, which includes tracks and signal boxes dating back to the 19th century. A massive refurbishment program has begun, but it is causing further disruptions, such as the nine-month closure of the critical Berlin-Hamburg line.

This method successfully reduced the transmission of mutated DNA, which can cause debilitating and fatal conditions, by 77% to 100% in the newborns.

With inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target and a strong jobs report, the central bank is widely expected to hold the federal funds rate steady. Since home equity loan rates are heavily influenced by the Fed's decisions, a significant decrease is improbable without a rate cut. While some lenders might make minor adjustments, most are holding firm, with analysts indicating that a potential rate cut is more likely to be considered at the September meeting or later in the year.

          <p>China has sent a "mini-brain" on a chip to its Tiangong space station to investigate the effects of space travel on cognitive function. The credit-card-sized device contains living human brain cells, nerve and immune cells, and capillary-like vessels, creating a highly integrated model that mimics the human brain's natural defenses. This experiment is believed to be the first of its kind in space and aims to provide more human-like data than previous studies using cell cultures. Researchers hope the findings will help develop ways to prevent common issues astronauts face, such as dizziness, sleep problems, and cognitive changes during long-duration missions.</p>

          <p>Despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vocal commitments to improving Native American health, tribal leaders are growing concerned about a lack of detailed plans and actions. While Kennedy's earnest rhetoric earned him early endorsements, his support for President Trump's budget, which tribal leaders say underfunds the Indian Health Service (IHS) by tens of billions, has caused disappointment. Furthermore, proposed cuts to programs like Medicaid, on which many Native Americans rely, seem to contradict his promises. The situation has left many tribal health advocates wondering when the administration's actions will align with the secretary's impassioned words.</p>

          <p>A small plane crash in a remote part of Olympic National Park in Washington has resulted in one fatality and two injuries. The incident occurred on Tuesday evening when a Murphy SR3500 Moose aircraft went down on a steep slope in the Quinault area of the park. Park rangers coordinated a rescue with the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island Search and Rescue team, who transported the three occupants to a trauma center. The two survivors are currently being treated for their injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, which remains unknown at this time.</p>

          <p>Iran has intensified its mass deportation of Afghan migrants, expelling hundreds of thousands in recent months and separating thousands of children from their parents. The government is justifying the crackdown with unsubstantiated claims that Afghans assisted Israel during a recent conflict, parading migrants on state television to air coerced confessions. This policy is occurring in a climate of heightened nationalism and pre-existing anti-immigrant sentiment, which has been growing since the Taliban's 2021 takeover of Afghanistan. The deportations are particularly devastating for Afghan women and girls, who are being sent back to a regime that severely restricts their rights and freedoms.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources report she was dismissed pursuant to the president's powers under Article 2 of the Constitution. Comey was a prominent prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where she helped lead the high-profile prosecutions of Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her father, James Comey, was famously fired as FBI director by President Trump in 2017. The dismissal is raising questions given her family connection and the politically charged nature of her father's relationship with the Trump administration.</p>

CEO Scott Kirby stated that the world is "less uncertain" now than in the first half of the year, leading the airline to project adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025. This comes after a rocky start to the year with weaker-than-expected domestic demand. While second-quarter revenue was slightly below estimates, the positive outlook suggests the airline anticipates a strong finish to the year, driven by resilient premium travel and stabilizing demand.

          <p>Criminal theft of cryptocurrencies has surged in the first half of 2025, with over $2.8 billion stolen from both platforms and individuals, a figure already approaching the total for all of 2024. A report from Chainalysis attributes the spike to a massive $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange, linked to North Korea, and a disturbing increase in physical violence against crypto holders. Attackers are increasingly resorting to kidnapping and coercion to gain access to personal wallets, which now account for over 23% of all thefts. This trend suggests that as crypto platforms enhance their security, criminals are shifting their focus to individual, high-value targets. (not investment advice)</p>

After intervention from President Trump and a lengthy standoff, a deal was reached to advance the stablecoin bill as a standalone measure. If passed, it will be the first major piece of crypto legislation approved by Congress, establishing a much-needed regulatory framework for the industry.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom decried the move as an "illegal action" and stated the state would explore all legal options to fight the decision.

The popular SAVE plan has been made defunct, and President Trump's "big beautiful bill" is phasing out several other income-driven repayment options. New borrowers after July 2026 will have only two plans: a standard option or a new income-based plan called RAP, which features significantly higher payments than SAVE. Critics argue these changes will increase the risk of default for many, leaving them with "no affordable options" to manage their education debt.</p>

The administration has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and federal prosecutions for white-collar offenses have declined over 10% compared to last year. This approach, combined with high-profile pardons for financial fraudsters, signals a more business-friendly and less punitive stance on corporate wrongdoing, raising concerns that it may encourage corruption and undermine accountability for financial crimes.</p>
