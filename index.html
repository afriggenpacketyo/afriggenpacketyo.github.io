          <p>Luigi Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal charges, including murder with a firearm, in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The Department of Justice intends to seek the death penalty, arguing the shooting was premeditated. Mangione is also facing state murder and terrorism charges in New York, as well as forgery and weapons charges in Pennsylvania. The case has ignited national debate on the healthcare industry, with Mangione's defense calling the DOJ's pursuit of the death penalty a political stunt.</p>

          <p>Federal judges are worried that the White House could potentially interfere with their security, specifically concerning the U.S. Marshals Service, which is responsible for judicial protection. This concern was raised during a Judicial Conference meeting where Judge Richard J. Sullivan highlighted the possibility of the White House withdrawing protection for judges. The worry stems from President Trump's direct control over the Justice Department, which oversees the Marshals Service, raising questions about the judiciary's independence and safety.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a significant legal victory, restricting compounding pharmacies from marketing cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies of these drugs, upholding the FDA's determination that semaglutide is no longer in shortage. This decision allows the FDA to target pharmacies making compounded versions of semaglutide, protecting patients from potentially unsafe and unregulated medications. Novo Nordisk has filed over 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies to protect Americans from health risks posed by illegitimate drugs.</p>

Tensions have escalated after militants killed mostly tourists near Pahalgam, leading India to accuse Pakistan of cross-border linkages.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's trade war with China is facing challenges due to China's greater need for goods than America's need for its money, a lack of allied support for the U.S. position, and less political damage to the Chinese Communist Party compared to the GOP. China's control over rare earth minerals and its ability to stimulate domestic demand give it leverage. The U.S. depends on China for various goods and faces political risks from the trade war, leading to a potentially difficult situation for the American economy.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office reports a 90% drop in mail-order cannabis from Thailand within three months, attributing the success to cooperation with Thai Customs. Stricter screening measures at the Thai border led to the interception of over 800 cannabis smugglers and the seizure of more than nine tonnes of cannabis. The deal is hailed as an example of international cooperation in combating illegal drug smuggling.</p>

          <p>A hairdresser in East London fears she could lose her business and home due to tax hikes announced in the recent budget. The tax changes are adding £23,000 to her annual costs, forcing her to reduce employee numbers and potentially close her salon. She cites rising employer National Insurance contributions and business rates as key pressures, highlighting the challenges faced by labor-intensive businesses. The British Hair Consortium is urging the government to lower VAT for salons to support the industry.</p>
