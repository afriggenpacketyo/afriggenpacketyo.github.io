          <p>As President Trump met with his advisors, the U.S. signaled that the next 24-48 hours are critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible or if military action will be taken. Despite saber-rattling rhetoric, U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weak position and may be forced to negotiate on nuclear enrichment. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, moves described as defensive, to protect American troops and keep options open for assisting Israel. The situation remains dynamic, with potential implications for upcoming diplomatic engagements. Optimism hinges on Iran's willingness to negotiate and the administration's tolerance for further delays.</p>

Cooperation includes monitoring shortages, coordinating responses to market disruption, and diversifying mining, processing, and recycling. The G7 also endorsed documents related to AI, quantum technologies, and transnational repression, while reaffirming support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced their steepest fall in eight months, declining 1.7% year-over-year in May, primarily due to decreasing shipments to the U.S. and China. Automobile exports to the U.S. notably plummeted by 24.7%, contributing to an overall 11.1% decrease in exports to the U.S. The Bank of Japan acknowledged that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade uncertainties, leading to concerns about declining domestic corporate profits. The trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen, which is smaller than anticipated, as Japan grapples with trade talks and potential tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based bioscience company with no revenue, has experienced a significant surge in its stock price, climbing 59,000% year-to-date and achieving a market value exceeding Lululemon's. The company, which develops traditional Chinese herb treatments for ADHD and autism, saw its shares more than triple after a stock split. Despite the surge, Regencell has reported net losses and has not generated revenue or filed for regulatory approvals for its treatments.

          <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier was found in civil contempt of court for challenging a judge's order to pause a new state law that criminalizes illegal entry into Florida. Uthmeier initially complied with the order to notify law enforcement but later sent a follow-up letter stating the order did not restrain them from enforcing the law. The court ruled Uthmeier's actions violated the temporary restraining order, requiring him to file bi-weekly reports detailing arrests made under the immigration law.

          <p>President Trump's approach to the conflict between Iran and Israel has exposed a rift among his supporters, pitting isolationist and hawkish factions against each other. While Trump campaigned on ending "endless wars," he also insisted Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons, leading to uncertainty about potential U.S. involvement. Conservative Republicans are working to block Trump from engaging in unauthorized hostilities with Iran, while others, like former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, urge the U.S. to stay out of the conflict.

Experts express concern over the higher potency of marijuana today and its potential health harms, calling for increased screening and education about the risks.
