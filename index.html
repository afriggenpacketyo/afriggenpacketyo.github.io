            <p>President Trump has warned that the exemption of smartphones and other electronics from import tariffs on China will be temporary. He stated that these products are subject to existing tariffs and are merely being moved to a different category. Trump also announced plans for a national security investigation into the semiconductor sector and the electronics supply chain, emphasizing a desire to reduce reliance on hostile trading nations like China. This policy shift has created uncertainty in the market, with analysts predicting potential economic consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amid recent market volatility, investors are seeking strategies for stable income from bonds. A bond ladder, involving investments in a range of treasury maturities held to maturity, can offer regular income and mitigate short-term price swings. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) replicates this approach, investing in treasuries and distributing monthly income until 2035. While ultrashort bond ETFs are popular, the bond ladder strategy aims to protect buying power and immunize against liabilities. However, investors should be aware of potential risks such as hyper-inflation and U.S. treasury default. (not investment advice)</p>
