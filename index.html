          <p>Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY) discussed key political issues, strongly opposing gerrymandering and advocating for a nationwide ban and term limits to foster more competitive elections and effective legislation. He criticized New York Democrats for attempts at mid-decade redistricting, highlighting their past constitutional violations. Lawler also addressed the persistent crime problem in New York, urging stricter prosecution of gun crimes and supporting federal law enforcement assistance. While generally against government ownership in private companies, he recognized the national security rationale behind the administration's 10% stake in Intel to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has vehemently denied rumors of his resignation, calling them "absurd," yet admitted his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis has become strained. His long-term future at the club is uncertain, primarily due to dissatisfaction with the summer transfer window's activity, as Nuno believes the team still needs a new goalkeeper and two full-backs despite over £100m spent on new talent. Despite strong fan support, football experts predict Nuno may struggle to win this internal dispute, highlighting potential rifts within the club's hierarchy and the playing squad's uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee, argues that the company's AI-powered surveillance and targeting systems, known as Istar tools, pose a grave threat to civil liberties. These tools, used by agencies like ICE and the IDF, combine vast public and private data to track and target individuals, enabling mass surveillance and forced migration. Pinto highlights concerns about violations of First and Fourth Amendment rights, including warrantless data searches and the chilling effect on public expression. He advocates for stronger privacy protections and consumer AI laws, as these technologies are increasingly adopted by both government and private sectors, impacting vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey highlighted the "acute challenge" facing the UK economy due to weak underlying growth and a post-pandemic decline in the workforce. He noted a rise in long-term sickness and a significant drop in young people working, exacerbated by an aging population. Bailey emphasized the urgent need to boost economic productivity, as the percentage of 16-64 year olds active in the labor market remains lower than pre-Covid levels, unlike other advanced economies. This participation decline contributes to fears that Britain's inflation rate, the highest in the G7, will be slow to meet its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

The article notes the unusual context of President Trump's second non-consecutive term, making historical comparisons less reliable. Factors such as Trump's popularity, the impact of recent legislation, and potential foreign policy crises could all influence voter sentiment over the next 15 months, making definitive predictions nearly impossible.</p>

This legislation, expected next month, aims to broaden the types of penalties courts can impose beyond crime-specific restrictions. It also seeks to limit short prison sentences to alleviate overcrowding and introduce an early release scheme for well-behaved inmates, inspired by US supermax prison reforms. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood confirmed serious offenders would not be eligible for early release, while concerns have been raised about funding and enforcement challenges for the proposed bans.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has explicitly denied the likelihood of an imminent meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating that no such discussions are currently scheduled. Lavrov underscored that Putin would only be prepared for a summit once a comprehensive agenda is finalized, which he claims is "not ready at all." These remarks directly challenge President Donald Trump's previous assertion that he had initiated arrangements for a meeting between the two leaders. The continuation of missile strikes on Ukraine and Lavrov's comments raise significant questions about the feasibility of Trump's peace-brokering efforts in the protracted conflict.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized President Donald Trump for "manufacturing a crisis" to justify deploying federalized National Guard troops into Chicago, bypassing local leadership. Jeffries, a New York Democratic congressman, asserted that Trump is "playing games with the lives of Americans" through his unprecedented domestic military deployments, which have already occurred in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker echoed this sentiment, condemning Trump's actions as an abuse of power and clarifying that no federal assistance was requested. Democrats contend that Trump's plan to override state authority and militarize cities is both illegal and a political distraction.</p>

The resort, built near a missile testing site, is part of Kim Jong Un's efforts to boost tourism, though currently only Russians are permitted to visit.

          <p>The Nigerian military announced it killed 35 jihadists in a series of airstrikes near the northeastern border with Cameroon, thwarting an attack on ground troops. This action is part of ongoing efforts to combat jihadist groups and criminal gangs that have plagued Nigeria for over a decade. Concurrently, the military conducted airstrikes against "bandits" in Katsina state, leading to the rescue of 76 kidnap victims, including women and children, though one child died during the operation. These operations follow a recent report by Amnesty International citing over 10,000 conflict-related deaths in Nigeria since President Tinubu took office two years ago.</p>
