          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for violations related to its sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for sewage operation breaches and an additional Â£18.2 million for "undeserved dividends." This penalty marks the first time Ofwat has fined a water company for such dividend practices, as Thames Water faces scrutiny over sewage discharges, leaks, and a Â£20 billion debt. The company secured a Â£3 billion emergency loan in March to avoid collapse and serves approximately a quarter of the UK's population, primarily in London and southern England.</p>

          <p>Tesco has implemented AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts to combat rising shoplifting rates, which increased by 20% in England and Wales last year. The technology identifies when items are not scanned properly and displays a live-action replay to the customer. While Tesco claims this will make the checkout process quicker and easier, some shoppers are mocking the technology, comparing it to VAR in football, while others express concerns over increased surveillance. A Tesco worker welcomed the new tech, citing the difficulty of monitoring multiple self-checkouts alone amidst high theft rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The State Department has temporarily suspended interviews for student and exchange visas to expand its review of applicants' social media accounts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued the order, citing the need to use all available information for visa screening and vetting. This decision comes as President Trump pressures universities to restrict speech, particularly concerning anti-Israel sentiments, and follows Rubio's previous actions to revoke visas and scrutinize foreign visitors' social media history. Universities rely heavily on foreign students for tuition revenue and research contributions, and the pause is expected to affect both new and existing visa applicants.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to Â£1,000 each, and may have debts written off following a scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will distribute over Â£70 million in compensation and support to customers affected by the practice of switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. Ofgem's review revealed that suppliers fell short of required standards, and a new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters. The compensation applies to customers of eight suppliers, with further investigations ongoing for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rising yields in Japan's bond market are raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S., as Japanese investors may repatriate funds. The yield on Japan's 40-year government bonds hit an all-time high, prompting analysts to warn of a possible "global financial market Armageddon" if this trend continues. Higher yields and a stronger yen could reduce the appetite for investing abroad, especially in U.S. tech stocks, which have seen significant Japanese inflows. Some analysts believe the impact may be gradual due to reduced short yen positions and a depreciating dollar, while others emphasize the structural nature of Japan's U.S. Treasury holdings.</p>

Russia also continued its attacks on Ukraine, launching six missiles and 88 strike drones, with 71 drones reportedly neutralized.

Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, especially the Taurus missile system, which Germany developed with Sweden.

Elon Musk acknowledged the loss of main tank pressure due to leaks and indicated that the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, despite previous delays and ambitious schedules.

          <p>The Japanese government is intervening to stabilize rice prices by distributing lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas. This move comes after retail rice prices doubled from the previous year, causing frustration among households. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries initially took orders from major retailers but later suspended them to allocate 100,000 tons to smaller supermarkets and rice shops. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi has assured that the government will ensure reserve rice reaches rural populations, imposing purchase limits on larger retailers.</p>

          <p>David McBride, an Australian whistleblower who leaked classified documents revealing alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, has lost his appeal to reduce his prison sentence. The Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal rejected McBride's appeal, upholding his five-year and eight-month prison term. McBride's legal team plans to challenge the decision in the High Court, arguing that it cannot be a crime to expose a crime. Rights advocates have criticized the prosecution, noting that McBride is the only person imprisoned over allegations of war crimes committed by Australian special forces troops in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have expressed concerns about the government's plans to release some prisoners early. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued that the proposals "could be of net detriment to public safety". The concerns include the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail if there is a move away from short sentences. The government maintains that the proposals address many of these concerns, with repeat offenders still facing short sentences, terrorists ineligible for earlier release, and increased funding for the probation service.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth test flight after successfully reaching orbit, marking another setback for the company. An apparent propellant leak after entering its suborbital trajectory led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin and ultimately disintegrate during re-entry. Despite the failure, SpaceX said the mission demonstrated the vehicle could reach orbit and the company will continue to review data and improve Starship's reliability. The Super Heavy booster also appears to have exploded during its descent, but the company says it ended up in the ocean.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket exploded during a test flight on Tuesday, marking the third consecutive failure for Elon Musk's company. During the un-crewed mission, the first-stage booster exploded, and the second-stage Starship spacecraft underwent a major fuel leak, spun out of control, and blew up during reentry. Despite the setback, Musk vowed to increase the launch cadence of Starship flights and emphasized the importance of learning from each test. Musk also leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has implemented sweeping reductions to the federal workforce and financial resources of federal agencies.</p>
