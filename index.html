          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced the signing of a historic peace agreement, declaring an end to two years of fighting in Gaza. Speaking from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, he described the achievement as "peace in the Middle East," a goal long sought but previously considered unattainable. The deal's finalization followed Hamas's release of the last 20 living hostages and Israel's withdrawal of troops from frontline positions. According to Trump, mediators will now proceed to "Phase Two" of the comprehensive 20-point peace plan to ensure lasting stability.</p>

          <p>As part of a new ceasefire agreement, Hamas has released 20 hostages, bringing a measure of relief amid a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. The article provides detailed profiles of the released individuals, including fraternal twins Gali and Ziv Berman, Nova music festival security guard Eitan Mor, and others who endured over two years in captivity. Their release was secured in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The deal marks a significant step in the peace process, though one female hostage is believed to remain in captivity, presumed deceased.</p>

          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, offering a way to manage retirement finances. Homeowners can typically remain in their home for life, provided they use it as their primary residence and fulfill all loan obligations. These responsibilities include paying property taxes, maintaining homeowners insurance, and keeping the property in good condition. The loan becomes due upon the homeowner's death, moving out, or failing to meet these terms, at which point their heirs have several options for repayment.</p>

In an interview, the actors emphasized that the film is designed to provoke conversation and debate about its ambiguous truths.

          <p>Detroit Lions defensive back Brian Branch is facing a potential suspension after striking Kansas City Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster following their game. Branch stated his frustration stemmed from what he perceived as an uncalled illegal block during the game, admitting his post-game reaction was "childish." The incident, which left Smith-Schuster with a reported bloody nose, was condemned by Lions' coach Dan Campbell as "inexcusable." The NFL is reviewing the matter, and Branch, who has been fined previously this season, could face significant disciplinary action.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Vodafone customers across the United Kingdom experienced significant service disruptions on Monday, affecting broadband, 4G, and 5G networks. Downdetector, a service monitoring web outages, recorded over 130,000 reports of issues, with many users unable to access the internet or contact customer service. The outage also impacted customers of other providers that use Vodafone's network, such as Voxi and Lebara. Vodafone later issued an apology, stating that its network was recovering but did not specify the cause of the widespread failure.</p>

          <p>Following the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the next phase of the Gaza peace plan faces significant hurdles, including the disarmament of Hamas and establishing post-war governance. Key components of the plan involve a surge in humanitarian aid and the formation of a new Palestinian security force overseen by international partners. However, disagreements persist, with Israel demanding Hamas's complete disarmament and rejecting Palestinian statehood, while Hamas refuses to disarm. The long-term success of the fragile truce will depend on resolving these complex and contentious issues through ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has closed its 21 museums and the National Zoo in Washington D.C. as a consequence of the ongoing federal government shutdown. The closures, which began Sunday, are due to the institution's reliance on federal funding, which constitutes over 60% of its budget. While the animals at the zoo will continue to receive care, public access and non-essential services like the popular live animal cameras have been suspended. This shutdown echoes the 2019 closure, which resulted in an estimated loss of one million visitors and millions in revenue for the cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>Amid rising interest rates, many consumers are impacted by common myths about managing credit card debt that can worsen their financial situation. One prevalent misconception is that carrying a balance helps improve a credit score, which is false and only results in paying unnecessary interest. Another harmful belief is that making only minimum payments is a sufficient debt management strategy, when in reality it can prolong debt for decades. Additionally, closing old credit cards can negatively affect a credit score by increasing credit utilization and shortening credit history, contrary to popular belief.</p>
