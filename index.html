          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed urinary symptoms that led to the discovery of a prostate nodule, with a Gleason score of 9 indicating a high-grade cancer. Biden and his family are considering treatment options, with the cancer appearing hormone-sensitive, which could allow for effective management. Support has poured in from across the political spectrum, including well wishes from former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Portugal's right-of-center Democratic Alliance secured victory in the recent snap parliamentary elections, marking the third election in as many years. However, the party once again failed to achieve a majority, prompting its leader, Luís Montenegro, to pledge efforts toward stimulating investment and ensuring prosperity and social justice. The Socialist leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, resigned following his party's second-place finish, with the far-right Chega party closely trailing behind. The final seat distribution may shift pending the counting of votes from abroad.</p>

          <p>Redcar and Cleveland Council in north-east England was targeted by a ransomware attack in February 2020, causing widespread disruption to essential services, including bin collections and social services. The attack, initiated through a malicious email attachment, led to the scrambling of the council's IT systems and a ransom demand from hackers. While the council refused to pay the ransom, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of public services to cyber-attacks, raising concerns about the potential for simultaneous attacks on councils and hospitals. The recovery process took months, and a Russian hacking group was later identified as the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China’s yuan has the potential to rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The economist, Hoe Ee Khor, argues that the US dollar is no longer the safe currency it used to be, and the yuan is growing as a possible alternative. To compete effectively, China must deepen its financial markets to allow foreign investors better access to yuan-denominated assets and address concerns about convertibility.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured his third major title by winning the US PGA Championship, overcoming a brief challenge from Jon Rahm. Scheffler's consistent performance and ability to maintain composure allowed him to cruise to victory, finishing five strokes ahead of the competition. Rahm's bid to win a first US PGA for Spain was derailed by errors on the back nine, while other contenders struggled to sustain momentum. Scheffler's win further solidifies his position at the top of the world rankings and marks his 15th victory since early 2022.</p>

          <p>India's aspirations to become a global manufacturing hub face potential setbacks as the US and China announce a trade "reset," potentially derailing Delhi's ambitions to replace China. While Apple's shift of iPhone production to India initially boosted hopes, a reduction in US tariffs on Chinese goods could reverse this trend. Despite ongoing trade negotiations between India and the US, challenges related to ease of doing business and competition from other Asian countries persist, hindering India's manufacturing growth.</p>

          <p>Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski won a narrow victory in Poland's presidential election, according to an exit poll, but a second-round run-off with conservative historian Karol Nawrocki will be required to decide the country's next president. According to a second exit poll released late on Sunday night, Trzaskowski, a deputy leader of prime minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Platform (PO) party, won 31.1% of the vote. Nawrocki came second with 29.1% of the vote. If the poll is confirmed by the final official result – not expected until late Monday – Trzaskowski and Nawrocki will compete in a second-round on 1 June as none of the 13 candidates won more than 50% of the vote.</p>

The escalation occurred as Trump pushes for a cease-fire deal, while Ukrainian officials argue that Russia's actions demonstrate a lack of desire for peace. The attacks are intended to exhaust Ukraine's air defenses and inflict maximum damage, even as diplomatic efforts continue.</p>

The company is developing systems like the Roadrunner drone interceptor, advanced headsets, and the Fury unmanned fighter jet.</p>
