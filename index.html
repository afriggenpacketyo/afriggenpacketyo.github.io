            <p>President Trump reportedly acknowledged that his initial tariff plans could lead to a recession but aimed to prevent a depression, according to the Wall Street Journal. Concerns in the bond market, particularly a spike in the 10-year Treasury yield, contributed to Trump's decision to roll back some tariffs. The reversal spurred a stock market rebound, with the S&P 500 experiencing its best day since 2008. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's rising influence and negotiations with multiple countries also played a role in Trump's policy shift. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>The Democratic National Committee is intensifying its efforts to host town hall meetings in Republican-held districts, focusing on the GOP budget bill and affordability concerns. These "People's Town Halls" will feature prominent figures like Senator Cory Booker and Representative Maxwell Frost, aiming to challenge Republican policies and connect with voters. Democrats criticize the budget blueprint for potentially cutting essential programs, while Republicans defend it as fiscally responsible. The town halls are a joint effort between the DNC, DCCC, and ASDC, with Republicans dismissing them as political theater. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>House Republicans approved a budget framework, enabling them to draft legislation for President Trump's domestic policy agenda, including tax cuts and spending on defense, energy, and immigration. The vote followed intraparty disagreements over spending cuts, with the House aiming for $1.5 trillion in savings. The budget framework unlocks reconciliation, allowing the Senate to bypass a filibuster and pass the final bill with a simple majority. Leaders emphasized unity despite past differences, highlighting their commitment to fiscal responsibility and making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs after initially imposing them, while simultaneously escalating tariffs on China to 125%. Baseline tariffs of 10% remain in place on imports from all countries, excluding Canada and Mexico. The pause allows for negotiations with individual countries, but the trade war with China appears to be intensifying. Trump's actions have caused market volatility, with economists warning of potential impacts on prices and trade relations. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent imposition and subsequent pause of tariffs demonstrate the dangers of unchecked executive power, revealing the potential for arbitrary decisions to disrupt the global economy. The article argues that the system of checks and balances intended by the Constitution has failed, with Congress and the Cabinet failing to restrain the president. This incident underscores the importance of legislatures and limited government, countering arguments for authoritarianism and highlighting the potential for one-man rule to lead to destructive outcomes. The author suggests that the Republican Party and the courts must act to constrain the president's power to prevent further damage. Optimism score: 30</p>

His lawyers argue his life should be spared in part due to the profound abuse he endured and his trial counsel’s failure to properly present his childhood trauma to the court.
