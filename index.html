          <p>A nationwide manhunt has been launched for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker mistakenly released from prison after being jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Kebatu, who arrived in the UK by small boat, was convicted last month for the Epping attack and was scheduled for transfer to an immigration detention center after serving his sentence. Justice Secretary David Lammy is reportedly furious over the significant administrative error that resulted in his premature freedom. This incident has ignited widespread public safety concerns and prompted an urgent review of the UK's prison and immigration protocols. Authorities are actively pursuing all leads to apprehend Kebatu, underscoring the gravity of the oversight and its implications for public trust.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty to federal mortgage fraud charges, including bank fraud and making false statements related to a 2020 home purchase. James, a prominent antagonist of President Donald Trump, vehemently argues that the charges represent a "weaponized" and "revenge" prosecution, particularly after her successful civil fraud case against Trump. The indictment alleges she falsely described the property as a second home to obtain an advantageous mortgage rate, while actually using it as an investment rental property. A trial date is set for January 26, 2026, amid legal challenges regarding the interim U.S. Attorney's appointment and revelations of internal prosecutorial doubts about the case's strength.</p>

          <p>Six men have received prison sentences for their roles in a Russian-ordered arson attack that caused £1.3 million in damage to a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine. Ringleader Dylan Earl, recruited by the Wagner Group—a mercenary organization proscribed by the UK government as a terrorist entity—was sentenced to 17 years. The Ukrainian-owned facility in Leyton, east London, was used to dispatch goods, including Starlink satellite terminals, to Ukraine. The court characterized the incident as a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" executed in the interests of the Russian state, highlighting the covert extension of geopolitical conflicts onto foreign soil.</p>

          <h2>Gold Prices Experience Volatility Amidst Conflicting Market Dynamics and Inflation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 12:39:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices are experiencing significant volatility, recently crashing from record highs before partially rebounding, impacting many investors. This fluctuation is driven by a tug-of-war between Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, a weaker dollar, and persistent inflation, which reached 3% in September. Historically, gold serves as an inflation hedge and safe haven, but its relationship with inflation is complex, influenced by global demand, central bank decisions, and the U.S. dollar's strength. Investors should view gold as a diversification tool within a balanced portfolio, rather than a guaranteed safeguard against inflation, while also closely monitoring real yields and interest rate movements.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has strongly criticized the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), labeling it a "subsidiary of Hamas" and asserting it will have no role in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. This position reflects the U.S. and Israel's hardline stance against the agency, especially after allegations of UNRWA staff involvement in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Despite UNRWA's claims of an unparalleled logistical network and readiness to assist, the U.S. reaffirms its commitment to not fund the agency, citing ample grounds to question its impartiality and alleged infiltration by designated foreign terrorist organizations. A U.S. Central Command center in Israel will now oversee Gaza stabilization efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has unilaterally suspended all trade negotiations with Canada after the province of Ontario aired a U.S. advertisement featuring a 1987 Ronald Reagan speech denouncing tariffs. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the suspension, stating the ad took Reagan's words out of context, a sentiment echoed by the Reagan Foundation, which is reviewing legal options. Trump, via Truth Social, labeled the ad "fraudulent" and "fake," claiming it aimed to interfere with a pending U.S. Supreme Court case on his tariff authority. This diplomatic rift occurs amidst critical trade deadlines, including the upcoming review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and Canada's efforts to diversify its export markets.</p>

While both parties aim to create favorable districts, challenges persist, including NAACP lawsuits questioning the legality of mid-decade map changes and civil rights groups alleging racial bias.

          <p>Ethiopia's Media Authority has "temporarily" suspended nine Deutsche Welle (DW) correspondents, broadly accusing the international broadcaster of violating media proclamations and disseminating unbalanced and conflict-aggravating reports. DW condemned the move as "outrageous censorship and intimidation," emphasizing its role as a vital source of independent information for millions of Ethiopians. This action reflects a recent surge in journalist detentions and increased government control over media, despite earlier hopes for reform under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Media watchdogs note that anti-terror laws are increasingly weaponized against journalists, with Ethiopia ranking 145th in the 2025 press freedom index, raising significant concerns ahead of the 2026 general election.</p>

The removal signals increasing pressure for him to lose further privileges, including his formal titles and residence at Royal Lodge.

Essential workers, like Jill Hornick from the Social Security Administration, continue to report to work without compensation, unable to claim unemployment benefits, unlike their furloughed counterparts. This forces them to drastically cut spending, contact mortgage lenders, and seek leniency from creditors, with some expressing anxiety about potential foreclosures. The prolonged impasse has significantly eroded the perception of government jobs as "safe," leading many, including long-term public servants, to consider leaving for the private sector due to the pervasive financial instability and uncertainty.</p>

Excluding food and energy, core CPI also registered a 3.0% annual rate, below estimates.

Collins informed police of this in December 2023, before charges were brought against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who denied the allegations. The charges, filed under the Official Secrets Act 1911, required proving that information passed on was useful to an "enemy." This revelation has ignited a political dispute, with the current Labour government accused by Conservatives of allowing the case to collapse by not labeling China a national security threat, despite the witness statement being prepared under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru achieved a significant victory in a local Welsh parliament by-election in Caerphilly, outperforming both the far-right populist Reform UK and the defending Labour Party. This result is seen as a bellwether for broader UK political trends, especially as Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, is currently ahead of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party in national polls. Plaid Cymru's leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, hailed the win as a choice for "hope over division," positioning his party as the "real choice for Wales" and the only one capable of stopping "billionaire-backed Reform." The high turnout for a by-election suggests increased voter engagement and a shifting political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase average Social Security retirement benefits by about $56 per month starting in January. This annual adjustment aims to help benefits keep pace with inflation, impacting approximately 75 million people receiving Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. While in line with expert estimates, the increase might not fully alleviate the struggle with higher prices for beneficiaries who rely on these payments as their primary income. The article details how to estimate the increase and notes that Medicare Part B premiums and tax withholdings will also affect final monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

The demolition proceeded without prior submission of plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, drawing legal challenges from a Virginia couple seeking a temporary restraining order.

          <p>The U.S. inflation rate ticked up to 3% in September, a rise that could complicate the trajectory of mortgage interest rates. While Federal Reserve rate cuts have contributed to recent declines in mortgage rates, the Fed's 2% inflation target means persistent inflation makes further cuts less certain. Although rate cuts for late 2025 remain highly probable, the latest inflation data slightly reduces their certainty, dropping from near 100% to the low 90% range. Homebuyers and owners considering refinancing are advised that waiting for potentially lower rates could be a costly mistake due to evolving economic factors. Locking in a mortgage rate now and refinancing later might be a prudent strategy given the potential for continued volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The inability of French authorities to prevent the theft or apprehend the perpetrators is presented as evidence that European elites lack interest in preserving their culture.

The article advises cost-conscious buyers to explore used or leased options to manage expenses, as new cars rapidly depreciate, losing about 20% of their value in the first year.
