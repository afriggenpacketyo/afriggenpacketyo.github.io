          <p>A Russian drone strike targeted a bus evacuating civilians in the northeastern Sumy region of Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of nine people and injuries to seven others. This attack occurred shortly after unsuccessful peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv aimed at establishing a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate act of violence against civilians, emphasizing the missed opportunity for peace. The local community declared a period of mourning, and investigations are underway to identify the victims, predominantly elderly women.</p>

          <p>Following the first face-to-face talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in over three years, a Russian drone attack struck a civilian shuttle bus in the Sumy region, killing at least nine people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the attack as a deliberate targeting of civilians. The talks, which included an agreement to swap 1,000 prisoners each, failed to ease the ongoing carnage. The situation in Bilopillia, near the Russian border, is deteriorating with increased bombardments, leading to civilian casualties and destruction.</p>

          <p>Many Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine view a ceasefire along current front lines as a failure, revealing potential nationalist discontent that the Kremlin might face in accepting a ceasefire. Interviews with 11 Russian soldiers highlight their desire to conquer all four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions claimed by the Kremlin. These soldiers express bitterness towards officials and civilians who they accuse of benefiting from the war while ignoring frontline hardships. The soldiers' demands suggest that President Vladimir V. Putin's annexation of Ukrainian regions has limited his options in negotiations, as anything less would be seen as a defeat.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that long-term care costs, which can easily exceed $100,000, pose a substantial financial burden for many Americans, with most households unprepared for such expenses. Over half of Americans turning 65 today are expected to require long-term care due to disabilities. Many are unaware that health insurance and Medicare often do not cover custodial care, which includes assistance with daily activities. As the U.S. population ages, the need for long-term care is projected to increase, raising concerns about how these costs will be funded, with Medicaid eligibility requiring significant depletion of assets.</p>

          <p>Individuals with links to the flat Earth movement have gained attention in American politics across states like Alabama, Georgia, and Minnesota. While their motivations vary from spiritual connections to skepticism of scientific consensus, data suggests that nearly 10% of Americans believe the Earth is flat. This emergence of pseudo-scientific conspiracy theories in politics has been met with mixed reactions, ranging from alarm to apathy. Political observers attribute the spread of these beliefs to the internet and social media, noting a decline in intellectualism.</p>

Trump emphasized Israeli priorities, condemning Hamas, calling for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran about its nuclear ambitions. While some Israeli perspectives express discomfort at being excluded from direct talks, analysts emphasize that Trump's "America First" approach doesn't negate his support for Israel.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants to fund Trump’s immigration crackdown, which advocates warn will create insurmountable financial barriers. The legislation could require immigrants to pay for asylum, caring for a minor, or applying for humanitarian parole. Republicans claim the fees offset costs, but experts say they could drain immigrants' resources, force them into exploitative work, or push them to leave. The bill allocates over $50 billion to construct a border wall and billions more for ICE, including hiring 10,000 new agents by 2029.</p>

This approach contrasts with current standardized chemotherapy regimens, and it involves exploring fecal transplants and other methods to manipulate the gut microbiome.

Both firefighters were involved with the women's team at Bicester Rugby Union Football Club, which said their presence will be missed. The London Fire Commissioner said Sadler exemplified courage and selflessness. The fire broke out on Thursday and its cause is under investigation.

          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan detainees accused of gang membership under the Alien Enemies Act, sending the case back to a lower court. The justices cited concerns about due process protections and the potential for detainees to be deported to a dangerous prison in El Salvador. The ruling deals a blow to the administration’s efforts to speed deportations, and it comes after a high-stakes legal fight between the administration and the A.C.L.U.</p>

The escalation comes as mediators seek a new truce for Gaza, while the UN warns of growing famine risks.

Discussions will cover energy, migration, agriculture, and data sharing. However, disagreements persist on issues like access for young people to live and work in each other's countries, and fishing rights.</p>

A High Court challenge over the use of the site this summer was won by a resident, Rebekah Shaman, after arguing that the council did not have the correct planning permission for the events. Cancelling the series of festivals would directly impact thousands of people, and the local economy would be hit hard.

Whether the closures will go ahead remains uncertain, however, as the company has yet to hold talks with labor unions, parts makers or municipalities hosting the plants.
