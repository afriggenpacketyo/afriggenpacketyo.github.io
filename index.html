          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, following his recent announcement of a "partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keenly awaiting details about the deal, particularly its structure and implications for U.S. Steel's operations. While Trump has stated that U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh and Nippon will invest $14 billion, specifics on the deal's mechanics are scarce. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick indicated that the U.S. government will have a "golden share" allowing it to influence board appointments and ensure production levels are maintained, representing a national security agreement.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and his administration, alleging that recent executive orders seeking to cut funding to the public TV network and NPR violate the First Amendment. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., argues that the executive order constitutes viewpoint discrimination and infringes on PBS and its member stations' editorial discretion. PBS CEO Paula Kerger stated that the Trump administration is targeting public media in multiple ways, including challenging corporate sponsorships and potentially rescinding already appropriated funds. The lawsuit emphasizes the profound impact the funding cuts would have on PBS's ability to provide diverse programming to Americans. Optimism remains low as PBS prepares to fight hard to protect its stations and public broadcasting across the country.</p>

Trump praised Musk as a great business leader and innovator, highlighting DOGE's efforts to overhaul the federal government. While Musk initially aimed to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, DOGE's savings have been estimated at around $170 billion, though some analyses suggest potential costs to the government.

The investigation suggests that Reyes may have been framed by someone involved in a dispute with him.
