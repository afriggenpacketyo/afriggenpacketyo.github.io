          <p>A Florida jury has determined that Tesla bears partial responsibility for a 2019 crash involving a vehicle on Autopilot, which resulted in one fatality and another person being seriously injured. The plaintiffs argued that the driver-assistance software should have alerted the driver or applied the brakes to prevent the collision. Tesla, which plans to appeal, has been ordered to pay up to $243 million in damages, a verdict that could set a precedent for future lawsuits regarding autonomous driving technology. The company maintained the driver was solely at fault for being distracted.</p>

The review, citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, contradicts the EPA's public claims of consumer savings. The report projects that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles would increase demand for gasoline, raising costs for all drivers and leading to the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035.

          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on imports is expected to drive up consumer prices and create extended uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on most countries, the average American could face over $2,000 in additional annual costs for everyday goods like clothing, toys, and appliances. While the administration argues the policy will revive U.S. manufacturing, economists warn of potential inflation, sluggish growth, and supply-chain disruptions as businesses grapple with the new trade landscape.

          <p>Donald Trump has intensified his public criticism of the Federal Reserve's independence, calling Chairman Jerome Powell a "stubborn MORON" and demanding an immediate, substantial cut in interest rates. In a series of social media posts, Trump urged the Fed's board to seize control from Powell if he refuses to lower rates, a move that breaks with presidential precedent of respecting the central bank's autonomy. The attacks came just before a jobs report indicated a slowing labor market, with Trump blaming the Fed's policies for any economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mechanical failure on a tractor-trailer led to a massive spill of hot dogs across Interstate 83 in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, causing traffic delays during the morning commute.

Emergency crews faced a slippery and unusual cleanup, with the fire chief noting that the spilled hot dogs were unfortunately unusable.

          <p>A new and specific form of psychological trauma, dubbed "droneophobia," is affecting Ukrainian soldiers returning from the front lines. The constant, high-pitched whine of FPV drones used for hunting soldiers has led to acute stress disorders, where everyday sounds from motorcycles, lawnmowers, or even buzzing insects trigger panic. Psychiatrists at Kyiv's military hospital report that a majority of recent patients with mental health injuries are suffering from this condition.

The report showed the U.S. added only 73,000 jobs in July and included significant downward revisions for the previous two months.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves before the trade deadline to strengthen their roster for the final stretch of the season. The team acquired right-handed relief pitchers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase to reinforce the bullpen and added versatile outfielder Alex Call for lineup depth. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that the additions raise the team's floor, but emphasized that the biggest improvements must come from the existing core of star players performing more consistently. The moves aim to support the first-place team's push for a World Series title.</p>

          <p>A psychotherapist who was once in a religious cult for seven years is sharing insights on how to recognize the warning signs of such groups. Gillie Jenkinson explains that cults often use tactics like "love bombing" and promise simple answers to complex life problems to draw people in. Key red flags include controlling behavior, an "us-versus-them" mentality, and high barriers to exit, where members fear losing their identity or facing retaliation if they leave. The article, tied to a BBC documentary, stresses the need for more specialized mental health support for survivors of coercive control.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for more than 60,000 people who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the decision to end the protections was "preordained" and potentially "motivated by racial animus." The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and stated it will appeal.</p>

          <p>An Ohio woman took a unique form of revenge after a Kia dealership repossessed her car a month after purchase. Upon discovering that Taylor Kia of Lima had let its business name registration lapse with the state, Tiah McCreary registered the trade name for herself. She then sent the dealership a cease-and-desist letter and filed a lawsuit. An appeals court has now ruled that her claim over the business name is separate from the car purchase dispute and can proceed in court, allowing her unusual tactic to get its day in court.</p>
