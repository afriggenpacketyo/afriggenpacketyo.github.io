Epic Games announced that Fortnite will remain offline on iOS worldwide until Apple reverses its decision.

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback when conservatives on the House Budget Committee blocked it from advancing, citing insufficient federal spending cuts. Five Republicans voted against the legislation, demanding expedited work requirements for Medicaid recipients and earlier implementation of savings. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to bringing the bill, which extends Trump-era tax cuts and increases military spending while cutting Medicaid and clean energy subsidies, to the floor before Memorial Day. Blue-state Republicans also threaten to withhold support if the bill does not further raise the cap on state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>President Trump alleged that former FBI Director James Comey was "calling for the assassination of the president" in a since-deleted Instagram post featuring the numbers "8647."

Comey has denied that his post was a threat, explaining that he posted a picture of seashells arranged to form the numbers and did not realize the association with violence.

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division.

Sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require agility and discipline.
