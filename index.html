          <p>Elon Musk confirmed Tesla has secured a major semiconductor deal with Samsung Electronics, valued at $16.5 billion. The contract, running until 2033, is for Samsung to produce Tesla's next-generation AI chips at its new Texas facility. This strategic partnership is crucial for Tesla's future AI development, even as Samsung's foundry business faces competition and challenges in other areas like high-bandwidth memory chips. The deal highlights the increasing importance of custom silicon for advanced automotive and artificial intelligence applications.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the renowned Shaolin Temple, is under criminal investigation for multiple allegations, including embezzlement and improper relationships.

This is not the first time Shi has faced such accusations, having been cleared of similar charges in 2015. The probe has become a major topic in China, casting a shadow over the 1,500-year-old institution.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old landlord sentenced to 53 years for a fatal hate-crime attack, has died in custody. In October 2023, motivated by the Israel-Hamas war, Czuba stabbed and killed 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and severely wounded his mother, Hanan Shaheen, because they were Palestinian American and Muslim. The attack horrified the large Palestinian community near Chicago and renewed fears of anti-Muslim violence. A civil rights group noted that while the killer is dead, the hatred that motivated him persists.</p>

In return, the EU avoided a full-blown trade war and secured zero tariffs on key exports like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, while committing to large purchases of U.S. energy and arms.

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has rejected diplomatic outreach from South Korea's new liberal government. In a statement, she asserted that Seoul's "blind trust" in its U.S. alliance and its perceived hostility make it no different from the previous conservative administration. The comments suggest Pyongyang sees no immediate need to resume diplomacy, as it continues to deepen its cooperation with Russia. This stance dashes hopes that the new government in Seoul could improve the deeply frayed inter-Korean relations.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a spike in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, largely fueled by Americans seeking a backup plan amid political and social volatility. Countries like Antigua and Barbuda offer a passport, and its associated visa-free travel benefits, in exchange for a real estate purchase starting around $200,000. While these programs are a vital source of revenue for the small island nations, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over concerns about security and financial crime. For wealthy buyers, the programs offer an "insurance policy" and potential tax advantages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a trade deal, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods imported into the U.S. The agreement, reached at Trump's Scottish golf resort, avoids a threatened 30% tariff and brings a measure of stability to the €1.4 trillion trade relationship. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to investing hundreds of billions in the U.S., including major purchases of American energy and military equipment. While the 15% rate is a concession by the EU, the deal averts a more damaging economic conflict.</p>

An investigation found that many dogs from countries like Romania are sold to UK owners online, sometimes arriving with infectious diseases like Brucella canis or severe behavioral issues. This "Deliveroo for dogs" system is putting pressure on UK-based shelters, which often have to deal with the fallout. The charity warns that the lack of regulation poses a risk to animal welfare and public health.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to function as intended during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey. The system significantly underestimated the quake's magnitude, resulting in only a few hundred "Take Action" alerts being sent, when up to 10 million people were in the zone of intense shaking. Most users received a lower-level "Be Aware" notification not designed to wake people up, a critical failure as the quake struck in the early morning. Google says it has since improved its algorithms based on the event's data.</p>
