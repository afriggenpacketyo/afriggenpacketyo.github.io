          <p>A former University of Kentucky student-athlete, Laken Snelling, allegedly heard her newborn baby "whimper" before the infant died and was hidden in a closet, according to new court documents. The affidavit reveals Snelling told hospital staff the baby showed fetal movement and that she passed out on top of the newborn after delivery. Upon waking to find the baby turning blue, she believed him to be deceased, wrapped him, and placed him in a trash bag inside a closet. Snelling has been charged with tampering with evidence, concealing a birth, and abuse of a corpse, and has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>A recent spike in mortgage interest rates to a three-week high has caused a significant drop in mortgage application volume, which fell 12.7% last week. The decline was primarily driven by a 21% plunge in demand for refinancing, as higher rates diminished the financial incentive for homeowners to secure new loans. Applications for home purchases also saw a slight 1% decrease after several weeks of gains. The market volatility highlights the sensitivity of the housing sector to interest rate fluctuations, which are influenced by broader economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth convened hundreds of generals and admirals for an unprecedented meeting at Quantico, which some analysts have described as an informal loyalty test. During his speech, Hegseth outlined his campaign to restore a "warrior ethos" to the military, while Trump suggested using U.S. cities as training grounds and warned officers who disagreed with his message about their career prospects. Both leaders explicitly told commanders who were uncomfortable with the new direction that they should resign.

          <h2>Government Shutdown to Delay Release of Critical Economic Reports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown will prevent the scheduled release of key economic data, including the crucial September jobs report and a forthcoming inflation report. This delay leaves policymakers, including the Federal Reserve, without vital information needed to assess the economy's health and make decisions on interest rates. The inflation data is also a component in calculating the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits, potentially affecting millions of recipients. The situation creates significant uncertainty at a time when the economy is showing signs of slowing down. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro announced he is prepared to declare a state of emergency, citing the threat of U.S. "aggression" following American military strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean. The move comes as the Trump administration has increased its military presence near Venezuela with warships, part of a stated anti-drug trafficking operation that is widely seen as a pressure tactic against Maduro's government. A state of emergency would grant Maduro special powers and could lead to the temporary suspension of citizens' basic rights. The declaration underscores the escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

Another key agenda item is a proposal to leverage frozen Russian central bank assets to secure a new €140 billion loan for Ukraine. This financial package is crucial for Kyiv's stability as it continues to defend against the ongoing Russian invasion, especially with U.S. support becoming less certain.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has announced that the Labour government will introduce a new law to permanently ban fracking for shale gas in England. The move aims to solidify the current moratorium, which is only a temporary suspension, and counter pledges from Reform UK to revive the controversial practice. Miliband argued that fracking offers no relief on energy bills and undermines climate commitments, vowing to "send the frackers packing." The legislation is part of Labour's broader strategy to focus on renewable energy and achieve 95% clean power by 2030.</p>

The flotilla, carrying over 500 people including climate activist Greta Thunberg, is on its third attempt this year to deliver aid directly to Gaza.

          <p>A new study indicates that Jewish and Israeli communities in Germany have experienced a significant increase in antisemitism, fear, and social isolation since the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023. Researchers found that respondents now face daily threats and exclusion, leading to psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Many participants reported feeling compelled to hide their Jewish identity and expressed a sense of abandonment by non-Jewish friends and neighbors. The findings paint a grim picture of Jewish life in Germany, with the head of the Central Council of Jews calling it a "dramatic escalation" of everyday antisemitism.</p>

The company stated the change is necessary to continue investing in the feature but has faced criticism from users, some of whom have accumulated large amounts of data over many years.

          <p>The U.S. government has officially shut down after Congress failed to pass a funding bill, leading to the furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees and the disruption of numerous services.

National parks may close, the EPA will halt most inspections, and the release of key economic data will be delayed.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications is a misguided policy that will harm U.S. economic growth and innovation. The authors, both immigrant professors, contend that highly skilled immigrants are vital for American competitiveness, particularly in the technology sector, and are responsible for a significant portion of the nation's innovation output. Instead of restricting access, they propose increasing the number of H-1B visas and distributing them more broadly across the country to stimulate local economies. They warn that the high fee will drive top talent to other countries, weakening U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>The concept of having a "best friend" offers significant psychological benefits that go beyond those of casual friendships, according to social psychologists. Research indicates that the quality of one's closest friendships is a stronger predictor of well-being than the total number of friends. Best friends are defined by deeper levels of trust, support, and intimacy, and people are often willing to provide more substantial help to them during crises. Designating a best friend can also provide clarity on where to invest limited social energy, fostering a relationship that provides a high return on emotional investment and staves off emotional loneliness.</p>

          <p>Despite high demand for housing, new apartment construction in Los Angeles has slowed to a near standstill, with the number of units under construction set to hit a decade-low. Developers cite an inability to secure financing as major institutional investors are now avoiding the L.A. market, a trend they attribute to unpredictable local regulations and policies like the new real estate transfer tax. Rising construction material costs due to tariffs and a thinned labor force have further squeezed profit margins. This slowdown threatens to exacerbate the region's housing crisis, pushing rental prices even higher.</p>

          <p>San José Mayor Matt Mahan is positioning himself as a different type of Democrat, one focused on accountability and measurable results over partisan rhetoric. The article profiles Mahan's back-to-basics approach, which prioritizes core city services like public safety and infrastructure, and his willingness to challenge the Democratic establishment, including Governor Gavin Newsom. Mahan has criticized what he sees as performative politics and has taken stances at odds with his party on issues like crime and homelessness. His pragmatic, technocratic style has drawn attention as a potential model for a party seeking to reconnect with voters' everyday concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown will have a severe impact on the Environmental Protection Agency, which is set to furlough nearly 90% of its 15,166 employees. This drastic staff reduction will halt most of the agency's functions, including pollution enforcement inspections, research, and the issuance of permits. While work on immediate environmental hazards and Superfund sites deemed an imminent threat will continue on a case-by-case basis, long-term environmental protection efforts will largely freeze. The shutdown exacerbates the effects of significant staff cuts and restructuring the EPA has already undergone during the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece contrasts the current immigration enforcement tactics under the Trump administration with past approaches, arguing that today's methods are characterized by unnecessary cruelty and dehumanization. The author recounts his father's experiences being deported in the 1970s, where he was treated humanely, and contrasts it with recent incidents, including inflammatory rhetoric from officials and aggressive actions by ICE agents. The article suggests that the administration's hostile stance has created a culture where officials compete in harshness, which has eroded public trust and is counterproductive to effective immigration policy.</p>

          <p>New rules have taken effect in California that revoke carpool lane access for solo drivers in designated clean-air vehicles, a policy that had been in place to incentivize the adoption of electric and low-emission cars. Over half a million motorists with active decals will now have to merge with general traffic, raising questions about the impact on commute times. While experts believe the change may not significantly worsen congestion on already gridlocked freeways, it removes a key perk for clean-air vehicle owners. The program ended after a bill to extend it failed to receive necessary approval from the U.S. Congress and President Trump.</p>

          <p>Health insurance premiums for plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are projected to increase by 114% in 2026 if enhanced federal subsidies are allowed to expire at the end of next year, according to a KFF analysis. These subsidies, which currently lower costs for 22 million people, are at the center of the congressional budget dispute threatening a government shutdown. Democrats are pushing to extend the subsidies, while Republicans prefer to address the issue later. The potential premium surge would affect enrollees across all income levels, compounding proposed rate hikes from insurers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-term study suggests that high vaccination rates against the human papillomavirus (HPV) in the U.S. are creating herd immunity against the virus, which is the primary cause of cervical cancer. The research found a substantial decline in infections from cancer-causing HPV strains, not only among vaccinated individuals but also a 75% drop among unvaccinated women. This indirect protection indicates that widespread, gender-neutral vaccination programs are highly effective at reducing the virus's circulation. Experts note that maintaining this community-level protection will depend on sustaining high vaccine uptake in the long term.</p>

The revered position is held by a young girl from the Shakya clan who is believed to be an incarnation of a Hindu goddess until she reaches puberty. The selection process requires candidates to meet strict physical and temperamental criteria. After being anointed, the new Kumari was paraded through Kathmandu before entering a temple palace that will be her home for several years, where she will be sequestered and bless devotees during festivals.

Social media users have expressed concerns that the program will disadvantage local graduates in an already challenging job market and could be exploited through fraudulent applications. State media has pushed back, calling the criticism "narrow-minded" and emphasizing China's need for high-level talent to advance its technological ambitions.
