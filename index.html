          <p>A recent European Central Bank report indicates that gold has become the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, surpassing the euro, due to increased demand from central banks seeking to hedge against inflation and diversify their holdings. Central banks' gold stockpiles are nearing levels seen in the 1950s and 1960s, driven by concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. While China, India, and Turkey have been leading buyers, there are signs that the rate of central bank gold purchases may slow down in the coming months. Despite this potential slowdown, analysts advise investors to maintain portfolio diversification and hold sufficient exposure to gold and hedge funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Malawi prepares for elections in September, young candidates are pushing for greater political inclusion, facing challenges such as entrenched party structures and financial barriers. A recent constituency re-demarcation has sparked interest among youth to join politics amid unemployment and the cost of living crisis. While some young entrants have launched their careers, others find that older leaders still heavily influence candidate selection within parties. Analysts emphasize that youth entering politics need solid strategies and resilience, while parties should create fair competition through transparent procedures for primaries. The article highlights the structural exclusion of young people due to the absence of youth-inclusive policies, high election costs, and societal resistance to youthful political actors.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a post-Brexit deal regarding Gibraltar's status, aimed at avoiding checks on people and goods crossing the Gibraltar-Spain border. The agreement establishes a system where passport checks are carried out by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the process at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, has been a point of contention between the UK and Spain, with Spain disputing the UK's sovereignty since 1713. The deal addresses concerns about potential delays at the border due to the EU's upcoming Entry/Exit system, ensuring that residents can continue to cross using residence cards or government ID cards.</p>

Economists are closely monitoring the report to see how Trump's decision to raise taxes on imports affects the economy.

          <p>Scientists have identified a new tyrannosauroid species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which lived over 85 million years ago and represents a "missing link" between smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids and larger apex predators like the Tyrannosaurus rex. The Khankhuuluu skeleton, discovered in Mongolia in the 1970s, was initially misidentified but later recognized as a distinct species with features not seen in more iconic tyrannosaurs. This mid-grade tyrannosauroid, weighing around 1,700 pounds, was one of the larger predators of its time and lacked the bone-crushing teeth characteristic of the T. rex. The identification has led to a rewriting of the tyrannosaur family history, showing that these Asian tyrannosauroids eventually migrated to North America and evolved into apex predators.</p>

The inflation rate likely rose less than expected due to a sharp decline in gasoline prices, offsetting price hikes in grocery items and housing costs.

          <p>Germany is actively working to reduce its reliance on Russian gas by increasing imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from various sources, including the United States. The country, like others in Europe, is constructing more facilities to handle the increased LNG imports. This move is part of a broader effort to diversify energy supplies and enhance energy security in the face of geopolitical tensions. The shift reflects a strategic realignment of energy partnerships and a commitment to reducing dependence on a single supplier.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-European government has won a parliamentary vote of confidence, days after a presidential election defeat. The vote was called after right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party and U.S. President Donald Trump, narrowly beat Tusk's candidate Rafal Trzaskowski. Tusk's coalition has sought to reverse judicial reforms from the previous government, but the outgoing President Andrzej Duda blocked those efforts. The vote is aimed at rallying support for Tusk's coalition amid criticism of slow progress on key reforms, with Tusk promising a cabinet reshuffle in July.</p>

The incident is the deadliest mass shooting in Austria's recent history, prompting a three-day period of mourning. Authorities are still investigating the gunman's motive. The shooting occurred at DreierschÃ¼tzengasse secondary school, with victims aged between 14 and 17, including one Polish citizen.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the most common complaint being frustration over maintenance costs and hidden fees. A typical homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, which can reach around $29,000 in states like Hawaii and California. These charges, such as internet bills, property taxes, and maintenance, are often overlooked during the purchase but can pose a significant financial burden.
