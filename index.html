          <p>A YouTube influencer was arrested by Indian authorities after attempting to make illegal contact with the Sentinelese people on North Sentinel Island.

Contact with the Sentinelese is strictly prohibited to protect their way of life.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador. Abrego Garcia had a protection order that should have prevented his deportation. ICE officials blamed an "administrative error" for the deportation but did not take action to rectify the mistake. The case has sparked outrage, with Maryland leaders condemning the handling of immigration enforcement and urging federal officials to correct the error.</p>

          <p>Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman believes there are benefits to building AI models that are "three or six months behind" the most cutting-edge models. Suleyman argues that this strategy is cheaper and allows Microsoft to focus on specific use cases. Microsoft relies on relationships with companies like OpenAI for AI models and CoreWeave for computing power. The company is focused on building its own AI internally but is not pushing to develop the most cutting-edge models first.</p>
