          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced a third round of negotiations concerning Iran's nuclear program, signaling a potential shift in Middle Eastern security dynamics. These talks aim to mitigate the risk of a U.S.-backed Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities and prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A successful agreement could lead to the easing of American sanctions, fostering economic and political transformation in Iran by opening doors to foreign investment. President Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal, emphasizing the potential benefits for regional stability.</p>

          <p>Three federal judges have temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools, citing concerns about academic freedom and the vagueness of the administration's directives. The judges questioned the lack of a clear definition of DEI and argued that the administration's actions could have a chilling effect on teachers. They also raised concerns about the potential for the executive branch to overstep its authority and influence school curriculum, which is generally prohibited by federal law. The rulings highlight the legal challenges facing the administration's anti-DEI efforts.</p>

          <p>Employee cuts at the Social Security Administration are leading to increased wait times and overwhelmed workers, affecting the agency's ability to serve 73 million Americans. The Trump administration's plans to slash the workforce by approximately 12% have resulted in burnout and confusion among remaining employees. Field offices, the primary point of contact for the public, have been disproportionately affected, with some losing a significant portion of their staff. Critics argue that these service cuts undermine the program, as benefits delayed are effectively benefits denied, and raise concerns about the loss of expertise within the agency.</p>

          <p>A decade after the death of Freddie Gray, the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood in Baltimore continues to struggle with disinvestment and lack of opportunity. Once a vibrant hub of Black cultural life, the community faces challenges such as a closed recreation center and unfulfilled promises of investment from political leaders. Pastor Duane Simmons of Simmons Memorial Baptist Church highlights the ongoing needs of the community, including addiction support and food aid. While some changes have occurred, such as a Department of Justice investigation into the city's police department, residents express frustration with the lack of meaningful progress.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines "woman" and "sex" as biological sex. The guidance states that transgender women (biological men) should generally not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals, shops, and restaurants. It also notes that transgender people should not be left without any facilities to use, suggesting the provision of mixed-sex or individual lockable facilities.

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has expressed concern over the deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras, suspecting that the Trump administration deported the child "with no meaningful process" and against the wishes of her father. The judge questioned why the child was sent to Honduras with her mother, despite the father's emergency petition to prevent her deportation. A hearing has been scheduled to investigate the matter further.</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers defeated the Los Angeles Kings 7-4 in Game 3 of their playoff series, overcoming deficits and scoring four unanswered goals in the final seven minutes. The Kings led the series 2-1, but the Oilers' win ensures the series will return to Los Angeles for Game 5. A key moment in the game was Kings coach Jim Hiller's unsuccessful challenge of an Oilers goal, which led to a power play and the winning goal for Edmonton.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between India and Pakistan following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's military modernization efforts are facing a critical test. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invested heavily in the military, seeking new international partners and expanding domestic defense manufacturing. The situation could escalate to India disrupting the flow of a major river system into Pakistan, a step it has never taken before.</p>
