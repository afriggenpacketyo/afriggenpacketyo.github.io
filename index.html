          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order came after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents took the family into custody. Judge Gordon Gallagher cited the potential for irreparable harm if the deportation proceeded without due process, as the family entered the United States in late August 2022, and were allowed to remain in the U.S. through late February 2023, and Soliman applied for asylum in September 2022, listing his family as dependents. The family's lawyer stated they are being held in an immigration detention center in Texas.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling over a dozen flights daily due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the delivery of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs, impacting Horizon Air, its regional subsidiary. The airline said it must cancel 14 flights a day through the end of July as a result of the delayed aircraft, which were expected to arrive from Brazil in May, and Brazilian imports to the United States have been subject to a 10% tariff since April. Delta Air Lines previously avoided tariffs by having new Airbus A350 airlines delivered to Japan before bringing them to the U.S.</p>

          <p>A proposed restructuring plan could result in the firing of nearly all remaining Voice of America (VOA) employees, leaving only 18 staff members at the federally funded news agency.

This restructuring raises concerns about the future of the agency and its ability to fulfill its mission of providing objective news and information to international audiences.

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying for a baby, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. There are concerns about the potential harm these medicines could cause to unborn babies, as it is currently unknown whether they pose risks. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends women use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before attempting pregnancy, and they are also concerned about the safety of these medicines being bought online without medical advice. This advice aims to ensure the safety of both mothers and their children amidst the growing popularity of these drugs.</p>

Mickelson commented on Desmond's post, hinting at potential issues with the situation. The EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the U.S. and Mexico are nearing a deal to resolve the sewage issue, but the problem has persisted for decades due to outdated wastewater infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to discontinue the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) "Quiet Skies" program, a domestic surveillance program for travelers. The program, which began in 2010, aimed to identify travelers who could pose an elevated risk to aviation security. Critics have long argued that Quiet Skies tracks U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes and that the criteria for inclusion and removal from the list are not transparent. The future of Quiet Skies staff and federal air marshals remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the Trump administration to take steps to provide due process to deported migrants, stating that they were likely treated unfairly. The men, who were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act, were deported without a chance to contest their removals. The judge asserted that the migrants are likely to prevail in their claims that they were denied fair treatment. This ruling underscores concerns about the administration's immigration policies and their impact on the rights of individuals seeking asylum.</p>

          <p>Denmark has become a pioneer in restrictive migration policies, driven by the center-left Social Democrats under Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. This shift occurred after the 2015 European migration crisis, when the anti-migration Danish People's Party gained significant power. Frederiksen's government has implemented measures such as processing asylum seekers outside the continent and tightening rules on family reunions. While asylum claim applications are down, critics argue that these policies have damaged Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law and the rights of asylum-seekers.</p>

Merz, from the center-right CDU party, is said to have a friendly relationship with Trump, and the visit comes after Trump doubled import taxes on steel and aluminum, prompting warnings of EU countermeasures. Merz's ability to influence negotiations with the EU is limited, but he is expected to voice support for Ukraine and call for stiffer EU sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <p>Confidence in higher education has declined sharply in the past decade, particularly among Republicans, with many Americans questioning the value of a four-year college degree for securing a well-paying job. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates is at its highest since July 2021, and the earnings gap between college graduates and high-school graduates has remained consistent since 2010. The value of college for lower-income students has declined since the 1960s, and factors contributing to this include lower-income students being less likely to enroll in traditional four-year colleges and states investing more in flagship schools than local public universities.</p>

Prosecutors described the case as unlike anything they had previously encountered, with Kroe initially befriending the victim before turning violent. He drained her bank accounts, refused to let her leave the hotel room, and denied her medical treatment after she broke her ankle. The woman secretly contacted a friend who alerted authorities, leading to Kroe's arrest and conviction on 33 felony counts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy has contracted over the past six weeks, with hiring slowing and businesses expressing concerns about tariff-related price increases, according to a Federal Reserve report. The "Beige Book" summary noted that economic activity has declined slightly, with widespread economic and policy uncertainty leading to hesitancy in business and household decisions. Hiring was described as "little changed," and the report indicated that higher tariff rates were putting upward pressure on costs and prices. The report reflects a cautious outlook for the U.S. economy amid trade tensions and uncertainty.</p>
