          <p>An eyewitness who was standing just yards away from Charlie Kirk described the moment the conservative activist was assassinated at Utah Valley University. Taylor Bentley recounted the initial shock and disbelief, followed by the realization of the event's severity upon seeing Kirk's injury. He praised the subsequent calls for unity from community leaders like Governor Spencer Cox, who have urged for dialogue over violence. The community has responded with vigils and memorials, honoring Kirk's memory and reinforcing a message of peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities have identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with his capture facilitated by his own father. After recognizing his son in FBI photos, the father contacted a youth pastor, leading to Robinson's arrest within 33 hours of the shooting. Investigators revealed that Robinson had become more political recently and that messages on his rifle casings included anti-fascist and taunting phrases. The motive remains under investigation, but the act is being treated as a "political assassination."</p>

Cameron Norrie, the British number two, overcame a challenge from a much lower-ranked opponent to win his opening match. Arthur Fery, making an unexpected debut due to an injury to a teammate, also secured a victory in his singles match. The team now needs just one more win on Saturday to advance to the first round of the 2026 competition.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Charlie Kirk's career highlights his significant impact on reshaping conservative politics for Gen Z, turning his organization, Turning Point USA, into a major force on college campuses. The article posits that Kirk successfully blended political activism with mainstream culture, making conservatism appealing and creating a vast network of young influencers. His mastery of social media and willingness to engage in controversial debates resonated with a generation skeptical of established institutions. This approach built a lasting movement that will likely endure beyond his death.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Seeks to Expedite Firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 16:34:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is urgently asking a federal appeals court to overturn a ruling that prevents President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The administration wants the matter resolved before a key Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week where interest rates will be decided. The president moved to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, based on allegations of misrepresentation on mortgage documents, which her attorney calls "unsubstantiated." Removing Cook would allow Trump to appoint a replacement, potentially giving him more influence over the central bank's monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has officially canceled the development of its all-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing a slowdown in consumer demand for battery electric vehicles in North America. The truck, which had already faced delays, was originally slated for a 2024 release. Instead of a fully electric model, the company will focus on launching an extended-range version next year, which will be named the Ram 1500 REV and includes a gasoline engine as a generator. This strategic shift is part of a broader reassessment of product strategy under new leadership at Stellantis.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox has made a prominent call for national unity and an end to political rage. Known for his "Disagree Better" initiative, Cox urged young Americans to reject violence and embrace difficult conversations with those holding different views. He framed the killing as a "political assassination" and a dangerous escalation of the country's polarization. The governor's response stands as a plea to lower the political temperature at a time of increasing threats against public figures.</p>

          <p>A court has ordered the suspended CEO of Pride in London, Christopher Joell-Deshields, to restore the organization's access to its bank accounts and company devices. Joell-Deshields was suspended amid an investigation into alleged financial misconduct, including claims he used sponsor-donated vouchers for personal luxury purchases. Following his suspension, he allegedly took sole control of company accounts, raising concerns about the organization's operational stability. His representatives stated that his compliance with the court order is not an admission of guilt, and an independent investigation into the allegations is ongoing.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Debate Fate of Trillions in Money Market Funds as Fed Prepares Rate Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to begin cutting interest rates, market analysts are focused on the record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds. The conventional "wall of cash" theory suggests this money will flow into riskier assets like stocks, potentially fueling a rally as cash yields decline. However, some experts argue that the vast majority of these funds, particularly institutional cash, will not move significantly unless rates fall to near-zero levels. They contend that for most savers, the slightly lower but still attractive rates will remain preferable to low-paying bank deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically. Experts emphasize that timing is critical, as lenders often price in Fed moves before they happen, meaning the best rates may be available for only a short window. It is also crucial for buyers to have a high credit score to qualify for the most favorable terms. The article suggests that buyers should prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate, as refinancing is always an option later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, the jailed mayor of Istanbul and a prominent political rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared in court Friday on charges of falsifying his university degree. Prosecutors accuse Imamoglu of faking official documents and are seeking a prison sentence of up to eight years and a ban from political activity. Imamoglu, a leading opposition candidate for the 2028 presidential election, maintains his innocence, calling the indictment absurd. The trial is widely seen by his supporters as a politically motivated effort to eliminate a key opponent from the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is approaching a potential shutdown as the September 30 funding deadline nears, with congressional Democrats refusing to support spending bills that do not include their healthcare priorities. Democratic leaders are demanding the reversal of changes to Medicaid and an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. President Trump has urged Republicans to proceed without Democratic support, but this is difficult in the Senate due to the filibuster. With the parties at an impasse, it is almost certain that a short-term funding measure will be needed to avoid a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. The decision lifts a lower court's injunction, allowing a provision that removes the organization from the low-income insurance program for one year. Planned Parenthood estimates this could force the closure of up to 200 clinics, many in rural or medically underserved areas, severely impacting access to services like cancer screenings and contraception. The organization called the move a "backdoor abortion ban," as litigation over the matter continues.</p>

He most recently served as general counsel for the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. Kamin replaces Carolyn Webb de Macias, who had served in the role since November 2023 on what was intended to be a temporary basis.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, weighed in at the same weight as champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez ahead of their highly anticipated super-middleweight title fight in Las Vegas.

The fight presents a historic opportunity for Crawford to become the first male boxer in the modern era to be an undisputed champion in three different weight classes. The bout will see Alvarez defend his four major world titles.</p>
