          <p>Brazilians demonstrated across all 26 states against a legislative proposal that could pardon former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies, who were convicted for a 2023 coup attempt. The protests, supported by prominent artists, followed the lower house fast-tracking an amnesty bill and passing a constitutional amendment making it harder to arrest lawmakers. Bolsonaro was sentenced to over 27 years for attempting to overturn the 2022 election results. Public opinion remains divided, with polls showing a narrow majority supporting his imprisonment while a significant portion of the population still backs him.</p>

McIlroy suggested that DeChambeau mentions other high-profile players like himself and Scottie Scheffler primarily to gain attention. The rivalry between the two has intensified following their showdown at the Masters and DeChambeau's victory at the U.S. Open. This exchange adds to the anticipation for the tournament, where Team Europe aims to defend its title on American soil.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan to bring Gatwick Airport's northern runway into regular use, effectively creating a second runway. The project aims to boost economic growth and create jobs by increasing the airport's flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 annually. The decision has faced strong opposition from environmental groups concerned about increased air pollution, noise, and climate emissions. To address local concerns, Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and measures to manage potential road traffic congestion.</p>

          <p>Iranian activist and engineer Sharifeh Mohammadi is facing execution after the Supreme Court upheld her death sentence for "armed rebellion against the state." The 46-year-old was arrested in December 2023 for her work with a labor rights committee, which the government deems an opposition group. Human rights organizations have condemned the trial, citing serious procedural flaws and calling it politically motivated.

          <p>Mandy Damari, the mother of a British-Israeli hostage who was held by Hamas for 15 months, has criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Damari argues the move effectively rewards Hamas for its October 7th attack while hostages remain in captivity and the conflict is ongoing. Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the decision, stating it is intended to revive hope for a two-state solution and is not a reward for the terrorist group, which he says can have no future role in governance. The move has been welcomed by the Palestinian Authority but condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert Murdoch, are likely to be part of the American investor group in the deal for TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as probable participants in the acquisition. The statement comes as negotiations continue to finalize a deal that would allow the popular social media app, owned by China's ByteDance, to continue operating in the U.S. under new ownership. The White House has stated the new seven-member board will have six Americans and that the U.S. will control the app's algorithm.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration closed an investigation into "border czar" Tom Homan, who was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. The sting operation reportedly involved Homan agreeing to potentially help the agents, who were posing as business executives, secure government contracts if Donald Trump won the 2024 election. The investigation, which began under the previous administration, was shut down after Trump took office, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director during President Trump's first term, stated that the U.S. job market has recently shown signs of degradation. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Cohn pointed to a slowdown in job creation over the past few months, from over 100,000 jobs per month to less than 50,000. He attributed this to companies cutting labor costs in a difficult economic environment with rising input costs. Cohn suggested that this trend, which he believes is occurring across all sectors, was a key factor in the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

When asked about the new rules, which require reporters to pledge not to gather unauthorized information, Trump dismissed their impact, stating, "Nothing stops reporters." The new policy, implemented by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, has been heavily criticized by free press advocates as a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint.

          <p>European Ryder Cup Captain Luke Donald has suggested that the American team could face pressure from their own home crowd at Bethpage Black due to a new payment structure. For the first time, U.S. players will each receive $500,000 to participate, a move that contrasts with the European team, who play for free. Donald speculates that if the paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on them. He emphasized that the European players are motivated by purpose and the tradition of the event rather than monetary rewards.</p>

          <p>China's first domestically developed large passenger jet, the C919, is being built in a highly advanced "smart factory" designed to prevent production quality issues. The assembly line utilizes an integrated network of 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, robot, and worker, creating a unified system for sensing, communication, and control. This futuristic approach aims to eliminate errors like missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft, which have plagued other manufacturers. The system represents a significant step in China's ambitions to compete in the global aviation market with high standards of manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions for journalists, requiring them to agree not to publish unauthorized information or risk losing their access to the building. The directive, part of a broader effort to control information flow, states that any information, even if unclassified, must be approved by an official before release. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the policy, asserting that the press does not run the Pentagon. The move has been strongly condemned by journalism organizations and free press advocates as an attack on independent scrutiny of the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests President Trump's increasing pressure on the Justice Department to prosecute his political rivals stems from his weakening public standing and a race against time to consolidate power. The article argues that rising grocery prices, stalling job growth, and unpopular policies are eroding his support, even among Republicans. As public perception of corruption grows, officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi face a difficult choice between obeying the president and risking future legal consequences. The author posits that Trump's administration is like a dangerously over-leveraged deal, vulnerable to shocks as he attempts to subvert legal and electoral processes before the 2026 elections.</p>

Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that over 4 million people will lose food aid as a result.

          <p>For the first time since 1927, hundreds of people participated in an organized swim in the Chicago River, marking a significant milestone in the waterway's transformation from a polluted sewer to a recreational asset. The event was the culmination of decades of environmental cleanup efforts, spurred by the 1972 Clean Water Act, which have restored the river's ecological health. Once known as "the stinking river," it is now home to dozens of fish species and enjoyed by boaters and riverside patrons.

Coyle previously worked with Skipper at Fresno State, where he ran a successful defense. With extensive experience as a defensive coordinator in both college football and the NFL, Coyle is expected to help implement a more collaborative defensive strategy as the Bruins head into their Big Ten Conference schedule.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market's record-breaking run could continue. They argue that the current S&P 500, heavily weighted with high-growth technology and communication companies, is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks, justifying higher valuations. The ongoing artificial intelligence boom is seen as a major driver of productivity and earnings growth that could further propel equities. However, some analysts caution that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this degradation. However, Epel notes that this damage can be mitigated through lifestyle changes. She recommends simple, daily practices to de-stress and promote cellular restoration, such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork.</p>

Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, especially as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is reportedly planning a digital ID scheme. Davey pointed to Estonia's digital ID system as a model that could empower individuals, but warned against any system that could be abused by an authoritarian government. The issue remains divisive within the party, with many members raising civil liberties and data security concerns.</p>
