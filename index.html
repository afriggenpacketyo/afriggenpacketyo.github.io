        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing a heatwave with temperatures expected to reach 32C for a second consecutive day, potentially rising to 34C on Saturday, particularly in central England. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant pressures on health and social care services. Many regions are expected to meet the criteria for a heatwave, sustaining temperature thresholds for three consecutive days, while the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for storms in parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. Firefighters are deeply concerned about the escalating threat of wildfires, with a 717% surge compared to the same period in 2024, and the public is urged to be cautious. The chance of reaching 32C in June has increased significantly due to human-induced climate change. </p>

          <p>Taichi Kokubun, a member of the Japanese pop group Tokio, has been removed from the TV program "The Tetsuwan Dash" due to past conduct that breached compliance rules, according to Nippon Television Network Corp. The decision was approved after a third-party probe found multiple instances of misconduct, though details remain undisclosed to protect privacy. Kokubun has accepted the decision and indefinitely suspended his activities, issuing an apology for his inappropriate behavior and lack of awareness. This incident occurs amid increased scrutiny of Japan's entertainment industry, following recent sexual misconduct scandals and allegations against Johnny & Associates Inc.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, a UK airbase, and sprayed two military planes with red paint, causing a security breach that has been condemned by the Ministry of Defence and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Palestine Action claimed responsibility, stating the action was intended to disrupt British support for Israel. While the RAF is assessing the damage, operations are not expected to be affected, and a defence source acknowledged the difficulty of providing complete security coverage for the large airbase. The incident has raised concerns about national security, with calls for a review of security measures at UK military bases, and Palestine Action has engaged in similar activity targeting arms companies since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise led by the French state and backed by other investors. The capital increase and debt refinancing plan will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights. Eutelsat became the world's third-largest satellite operator after combining with British satellite firm OneWeb in 2023 and recently secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces for priority-access space resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a sharp decline in May, primarily driven by a "dismal" month for supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes dropped by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, with food retailers reporting lower sales of alcohol and tobacco as households cut back on spending. Separate figures revealed government borrowing reached the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993, reflecting increased spending. Cost-of-living pressures, particularly higher food prices, remain a key issue for UK consumers, with some retailers noting that inflation is prompting consumers to reduce their spending.</p>

          <p>Singer Chris Brown pleaded not guilty in London to a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent related to an alleged 2023 nightclub incident. Brown was arrested in Manchester and released after paying a Â£5 million security fee, allowing him to continue his tour. He has a history of legal issues, most notably pleading guilty to felony assault against Rihanna in 2009, resulting in probation until 2015. The current charge stems from an incident in London, where he is accused of a serious assault, and he will face further legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>The United States is at risk of repeating the catastrophic mistakes of the Iraq War by considering military action against Iran, based on the premise that Iran is building a nuclear weapon. A potential war with Iran could lead to an open-ended conflict in a region of marginal strategic significance, triggering retaliation against Americans and destabilizing the Middle East. The author argues that a diplomatic solution, even if imperfect, is preferable to war, and that the United States should prioritize its own interests and well-being over the desires of a rogue ally. By stepping back from the brink, America can open up new possibilities for peace and focus on solving its many domestic problems.</p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully tested artillery-launched drones capable of withstanding the immense forces within a 155mm cannon shell after 12 years of development. The drones endured launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight during live-fire trials, thanks to a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism. This low-cost system separates the drone from the artillery shell mid-flight without electronic controls, enabling the drones to reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers and extend loiter time. The technology stems from a 2013 design called Tianyan ("sky eye"), which gained attention in a new-concept aircraft competition.</p>

It proposes increasing revenues by eliminating the cap on wages subject to payroll tax and taxing investment income, while also highlighting the regressive nature of the payroll tax.

The union seeks to understand whether the lab can properly service the state's agribusiness, but UC Davis has refused to release the records, citing an exemption to protect personal privacy and calling the request "unduly burdensome."</p>

The plot zigs and zags, dipping in and out of each character's life, exploring themes of love, loss, and acceptance.

          <p>The musical "Parade," which tells the story of Leo Frank, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1913, has been revived at the Ahmanson Theatre, offering a poignant and timely reflection on antisemitism and systemic bias in the judicial system. The production, directed by Michael Arden, explores the cultural, historical, and political context of the trial, as well as the evolving relationship between Leo and his wife, Lucille. While the musical delves into dark themes, it also highlights the human figures caught in the snares of American bigotry, making the contemporary parallels resonate powerfully.

Gulf countries have normalized relations with Iran in recent years, believing that regional stability is essential for prosperity, and they are wary of being caught in the middle of a broader conflict.

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts following destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to guide the rebuilding process. The authority would aim to prevent land speculation and ensure that new homes are affordable for displaced people, while also promoting climate-resilient and equitable recovery. The commission also proposed a ballot measure to create a new Los Angeles County Fire Control District to focus on wildfire prevention and vegetation management.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is grappling with a budget crisis exacerbated by skyrocketing legal payouts, which have risen from $64 million a decade ago to $289 million this fiscal year. Factors contributing to the increase include aging infrastructure, larger jury awards, and a backlog of cases from the COVID-19 pandemic. City officials have cited the payouts as a significant factor in a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall, leading to layoffs and spending cuts. Some plaintiffs' attorneys suggest that the city attorney's legal strategies, including taking more cases to trial, are contributing to the rising liability costs.</p>

          <p>As immigration raids intensify across Southern California, the Adelanto ICE Processing Center is experiencing a surge in detainees, raising concerns about unsafe and unsanitary conditions inside the facility. The number of detainees has increased dramatically, leading to overcrowding, inadequate medical care, and limited access to basic necessities like clean clothes and communication with family. Members of Congress who toured the facility reported detainees being held for extended periods without changes of clothes or access to telephones, prompting criticism of the inhumane treatment. Critics warn that the facility is ill-prepared to handle the influx of detainees, jeopardizing the safety and well-being of those held there.</p>

The city attorney's office is also targeting rental giants and homeowners for price-gouging and short-term rental violations, issuing cease-and-desist letters and filing lawsuits.

Similar measures have been explored in other states, with New Hampshire offering "Hike Safe Cards" to support search-and-rescue efforts and avoid potential charges.
