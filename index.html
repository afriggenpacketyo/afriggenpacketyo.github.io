          <p>Autism experts and autistic individuals are expressing concern over Robert F. Kennedy's approach to autism as the health secretary, particularly regarding proposed expansive monitoring of autistic people's health records and potential cuts to disability services. These concerns stem from Kennedy's previous statements that autistic people do not contribute to society and that autism "destroys" families. Researchers emphasize that lack of support, rather than autism itself, poses the greatest challenges for autistic individuals and their families. The Trump administration's policies, including cuts to healthcare and research, are also seen as detrimental to the autism community. Optimism score: 20</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's approach to family formation, characterized by having numerous children with multiple partners through both natural means and IVF, has sparked debate about the future of family life. Critics argue that this "techno-polygamy" model, while celebrated by some as pronatalist and evolutionary, may lead to negative outcomes for children due to absent parents and fractured family relationships. Concerns are also raised about the potential for sex selection and increased multiple births associated with IVF, which could have adverse demographic and social consequences. Ultimately, the article contends that stable, loving families headed by two married parents provide the best environment for children. Optimism score: 35</p>
