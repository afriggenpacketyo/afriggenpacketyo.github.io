          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Enforcement of Trump's Transgender Military Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 16:21:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to enforce its policy barring transgender individuals from military service while legal challenges proceed. This decision pauses a lower court order that had blocked the ban nationwide, with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissenting. The policy stems from an executive order citing concerns about military readiness and cohesion, while opponents argue it is discriminatory and harms military effectiveness. The policy disqualifies individuals with gender dysphoria from military service unless they obtain a waiver, leading to legal challenges based on sex and transgender status. This article highlights the ongoing legal battle and differing perspectives on the ban's impact on transgender service members and military readiness.</p>

          <p>This article explains the hidden costs associated with collection debt, which extend beyond the original balance to include interest, late fees, collection agency fees, and potential legal costs. It highlights how these factors can quickly inflate the debt, making it more difficult to manage. The article also discusses the long-term impact of collection debt on credit scores, which can indirectly lead to higher interest rates on future loans and credit cards. To mitigate these costs, the article suggests negotiating settlements, requesting fee waivers, seeking professional help from debt relief companies, and considering legal options.

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including snuff tubes, containing traces of DMT and tobacco at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found indicates that only select members of Chav√≠n society participated in these rituals.
