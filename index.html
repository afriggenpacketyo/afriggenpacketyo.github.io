          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has been engaging with world leaders and briefing diplomats, seemingly building a case for potential military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of having links to the attack. Despite not officially identifying the group responsible or providing concrete evidence, Indian officials have referenced Pakistan's alleged past support for terrorist groups targeting India.

          <p>Australian politicians are contemplating placing caps on the number of international students as a measure to alleviate the country's housing affordability crisis. This marks a shift from Australia's previous stance, where international education was viewed as a key economic driver. The argument is that limiting international students will reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, subsequently lowering prices. Some worry about the economic impact, while others believe it's a necessary step to address voter concerns.</p>
