          <p>During Liverpool FC's Premier League victory parade, a car collided with pedestrians on Water Street, resulting in 27 people being hospitalized, including one child, and 20 others treated at the scene. A 53-year-old man from the Liverpool area was arrested and is believed to be the driver. Witnesses described the car speeding through the crowd, with some people attempting to stop it, and police have stated that the incident is not being treated as terror-related. The event occurred about a mile from the parade's finishing point, prompting a large emergency response and leaving many injured, including children, as the celebrations turned chaotic.</p>

He believes the garden center work helps him stay grounded and reduces pressure on the field, providing a sense of stability regardless of his performance in cricket.

          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of the government's stockpiled rice through direct contracts, following the agriculture minister's announcement of a revised scheme to combat soaring rice prices. The amount requested accounts for over 30% of the 300,000 tons designated for release through direct sales, bypassing the auction system previously used. Retailers like Don Quijote, Rakuten Group Inc., and Aeon Co. plan to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms starting in early June to meet the government's price target. The government is also considering expanding eligibility to smaller supermarkets and rice shops to ensure stable food supply and alleviate public anxiety over rising prices.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant decline of 49% in April, attributed to brand damage linked to Elon Musk's political involvement and increasing competition. Despite overall battery electric car sales rising in Europe, Tesla's sales have tanked nearly 40% over the January-April period. The company faces challenges from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players like BYD, which sold more pure electric cars in Europe than Tesla for the first time. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve, further impacting its sales performance.</p>

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to support businesses and households affected by tariffs, as officials negotiate with the U.S. for relief from auto levies. The funds aim to bolster small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs ahead of an upper house election in July. This action follows similar aid plans from countries like Spain and Canada in response to escalating tariffs. The automotive sector, a key part of the Japanese economy, is already feeling the impact of U.S. tariffs, leading companies like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan to forecast sharp declines in earnings and consider production shifts.

          <p>A groundbreaking study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. Rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on a tolerance to low temperatures across multiple generations, driven by DNA methylation changes. This research supports the long-dismissed theory of Lamarckism, which posits that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The study positions Lamarckism as a potential force in evolution, requiring modern biology to reconcile epigenetics with core evolutionary principles.</p>

Max Verstappen criticized the rule, suggesting it didn't improve racing at Monaco, where overtaking is already difficult.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The diamond industry faces challenges from tariffs and the rise of lab-grown diamonds (LGD), which are chemically identical to mined diamonds but sold at a significant discount. A potential 10% import duty to the U.S. could further disrupt the industry, already contending with a slowdown in demand. The complex supply chain of diamonds makes them susceptible to trade disruptions, while the increasing popularity of LGD has caused a price drop in mined diamonds. Despite these challenges, some analysts believe the industry is approaching a stabilization point, with key players like De Beers focusing on natural diamonds and closing their LGD jewelry brand.</p>

The film portrays the recruitment and daily lives of women forced to taste food prepared for Hitler, amid fears of poisoning. The story explores the moral complexities of the characters, caught in a horrific system, and draws parallels with contemporary political violence. While historical accuracy is debated, the film remains relevant in its portrayal of the human condition under oppressive circumstances.</p>

Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margin to be under pressure in the short term but anticipate the company will offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs. (not investment advice)</p>
