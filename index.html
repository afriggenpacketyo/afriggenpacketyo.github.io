        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Online fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move seen as an attempt to pressure U.K. regulators and advance its stalled listing ambitions. The Singapore-based retailer has struggled to gain approval in London and previously faced significant pushback in New York due to allegations over its labor practices and supply chain transparency. This strategic shift to Hong Kong represents another attempt by the company to access public markets and secure international legitimacy despite ongoing scrutiny from Western lawmakers and regulators.</p>

          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse have been recovered. The coroner's office is now working to formally identify the victims through DNA testing. The investigation into the blast is ongoing, with federal agencies involved, and has revealed that the warehouse, owned by a county sheriff's lieutenant, was not permitted to store fireworks. The incident has left families grieving and demanding justice for their loved ones.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu celebrated recent strikes on Iran, with Netanyahu nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. However, the event highlighted significant unresolved issues, including stalled Gaza ceasefire talks and Netanyahu's public resistance to a two-state solution. Analysts suggest the meeting was more a public relations event than a substantive policy breakthrough, with major diplomatic challenges on key regional security issues remaining behind closed doors.</p>

          <p>An analysis of public records shows that officials in Kerr County, Texas, spent years discussing the need for an improved flood warning system long before the recent deadly floods. A 2016 study identified the area as highly flood-prone and described the existing infrastructure as "antiquated and unreliable," recommending a nearly $1 million upgrade. Despite these long-standing recognitions of risk and more recent discussions to select a firm for a new system, the critical safety measures were not implemented.</p>

The final is particularly significant for Silva, as he won the same trophy with Chelsea in 2021 and now seeks a historic victory with the club where he began his youth career.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is reportedly phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard pre-flight security checks at some U.S. airports. Sources familiar with the change confirmed it is being rolled out gradually, with airports in Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia among the first to see the rule expire. This marks a significant shift in airport security protocols, which were broadly implemented nationwide in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" terrorist plot.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were defeated 9-1 by the Milwaukee Brewers, marking their fourth consecutive loss after a catastrophic first inning from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. In the shortest start of his MLB career, Yamamoto surrendered five runs on 41 pitches before being pulled with only two outs. The early deficit, compounded by poor defense and an anemic offensive performance from the shorthanded Dodgers lineup, proved to be completely insurmountable for the remainder of the game.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has taken a significant step toward permanently protecting renters from "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels. The council voted to amend an ordinance to prevent such evictions unless a government agency orders the property to be vacated for safety reasons. The city is also crafting rules to require landlords to provide relocation assistance or comparable temporary housing for tenants displaced by legitimate, necessary renovations.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas over the holiday weekend have killed at least 104 people, with a search and rescue effort still underway for the missing, including numerous summer campers. The disaster was triggered by a massive weather system that caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts before the deluge hit.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has issued a grim forecast, projecting its second-quarter operating profit will fall by 56%, far below analyst expectations. The South Korean tech giant is struggling to capture demand in the booming market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential for AI processors from industry leader Nvidia. This difficulty, combined with ongoing losses in its chip foundry business, has contributed to the significant expected decline in profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its controversial plan for a large-scale layoff of employees that was slated for August. The agency announced that a department-wide reduction-in-force is no longer necessary, as it is on pace to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze. The initial plan, which could have cut more than 80,000 jobs to return to 2019 staffing levels, had drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers and veterans' advocates.</p>
