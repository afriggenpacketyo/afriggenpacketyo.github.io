          <p>The White House has confirmed a halt on some weapons deliveries to Ukraine, a decision made after a Pentagon review raised concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. This move represents a shift in policy under the Trump administration, prioritizing American military readiness. The pause follows previous temporary holds on aid and intelligence sharing, which were later lifted. The specific weapons being withheld have not been disclosed, but the decision comes as Ukraine continues to rely heavily on international military support in its ongoing war with Russia.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. According to prosecutors, he will plead guilty to all charges in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The decision has brought mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing relief at avoiding a prolonged trial and others fury that Kohberger will not face capital punishment. A hearing is scheduled to formalize the plea, potentially bringing a conclusion to the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has experienced a significant political setback, being forced into a humiliating U-turn on its welfare reform plans following a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The government reversed its decision to change eligibility criteria for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) after facing the prospect of a parliamentary defeat. This episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority, drawn comparisons to the chaotic periods of previous governments, and raised questions about his control over his party and the future of his chancellorship.</p>

In response, Trump suggested that the lucrative government contracts held by Musk's companies, like SpaceX, could be at risk.

However, attorneys for the survivors have criticized the filing as a delay tactic to avoid accountability and justice.

          <p>The massive spending bill passed by the Senate includes potential cuts of $930 billion to Medicaid over the next decade, raising alarms for the nation's nursing homes. A large percentage of nursing home residents rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of their care, and facility operators are concerned the cuts could lead to reduced staffing and services. A Republican state senator from West Virginia, whose grandmother is a resident, expressed concern that the budget should not be balanced "on the backs of nursing home residents."

Researchers estimate that USAID programs have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades through initiatives like HIV medication distribution and child nutrition. The study warns that the permanent cessation of this aid could result in an additional 14 million preventable deaths by 2030.

While June brought some rain to western areas, the east remained dry, and long-term forecasts suggest this pattern may continue.

          <p>California has enacted a major reform of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a move intended to spur housing construction across the state. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This eliminates a significant barrier that opponents often used to delay or block new developments through lengthy environmental reviews and lawsuits.

          <p>A provision within the new GOP spending bill that blocks abortion clinics from receiving Medicaid funds for non-abortion services is being hailed as a significant victory for the anti-abortion movement. If passed, the measure would affect clinics nationwide, not just in Republican-led states, by cutting off a major source of revenue for services like cancer screenings and STI testing. Experts warn this could force many clinics to close or severely limit their services, potentially having the largest impact on abortion access since the Hyde Amendment. This represents a major federal-level push against abortion providers.</p>
