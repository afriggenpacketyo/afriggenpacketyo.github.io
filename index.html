          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling down, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling in the first few months of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Job vacancies have also declined, indicating a potential impact from April's increase in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage. Wage growth has slowed but remains relatively strong, leading the Bank of England to remain cautious about future interest rate cuts. This article highlights the balancing act the Bank faces between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth.</p>
