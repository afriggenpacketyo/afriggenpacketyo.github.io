          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production.

Free cash flow for the quarter was announced at $19.2 billion, a decrease from $22.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024, while cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.7 billion, compared to $33.6 billion last year.

          <p>The newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's cabinet appointments are under scrutiny due to potential lobbying conflicts. Several ministers have direct ties to the business world, raising concerns about undue influence on political decision-making. Experts at Transparency Germany highlight the need for stricter regulations to prevent conflicts of interest, noting that while expertise from the business sector can be valuable, the absence of clear rules creates critical situations. The article explains that Germany's Lobby Register, introduced in 2022, requires lobbyists to register, but exceptions exist, and consequences for violations are limited.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. Exports of this technology have surged by 153% from 2020 to 2024, driven by rising energy demand in Africa and China's dominance in solar panel production.
