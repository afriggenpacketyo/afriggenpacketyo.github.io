            <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to lower interest rates immediately, as stock markets experienced a significant downturn. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also experiencing substantial losses. Trump's remarks, made on Truth Social, blamed Powell for potentially slowing the economy and added to investor anxieties already fueled by ongoing tariff uncertainties. This situation highlights the tension between the White House and the Federal Reserve regarding monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, a trend fueled by concerns about the safety and credibility of US assets. Renmin University's International Monetary Institute survey results indicate a growing preference for yuan settlements. Economists suggest that the weakening dominance of the US dollar, particularly due to policies from the Trump administration, is creating a favorable environment for the yuan's internationalization. This shift reflects a broader trend of diversification away from the US dollar in global trade and finance.</p>

            <p>An old Virginia prison, formerly known as the Lorton Reformatory, has been transformed into the Liberty Crest Apartments. The prison, which housed inmates from Washington, D.C. from 1910 to 2001, was also the site where many suffragists were held. The 2,324-acre property was shut down in 2001 and bought the following year for $4.2 million. Renovations took almost two years and roughly $64 million to complete. The Liberty Crest Apartments have 165 units — 44 of which are designated affordable, low-income housing.</p>

Unai Emery's insistence that Villa should be “angry” after their Champions League exit, brilliantly well as they played, proved a masterstroke, which produced their best performance of the season. Back-to-back qualifications for the Champions League would go a long way towards establishing the club among the elite.</p>
