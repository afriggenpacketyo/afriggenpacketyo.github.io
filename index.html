        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve declared it would abide by any court decision regarding President Trump's move to dismiss Governor Lisa Cook, who is actively challenging her termination. The central bank underscored that Congress intentionally established long, fixed terms and removal protections for its governors, viewing these as crucial safeguards to ensure monetary policy decisions are rooted in data, economic analysis, and the nation's long-term interests, rather than political influence. This statement came after Trump cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud as his reason for attempting to remove Cook. The Fed reaffirmed its dedication to transparency, accountability, and independence in its critical role for American families and businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of Americans face mounting credit card debt due to high APRs, record balances, and rising inflation, making payments difficult. Ignoring the issue can lead to late fees and credit score damage, but several options exist. Consumers should first contact their credit card companies to explore hardship programs like reduced payments or lower interest rates. Other viable strategies include credit counseling for budgeting and negotiation, balance transfers to 0% APR cards for temporary relief, or debt consolidation loans to combine multiple balances into a single, lower-interest payment. Taking prompt action is crucial to avoid severe financial consequences and achieve stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared his intent to swiftly establish a "majority" of his nominees on the Federal Reserve board, aiming to push for significant interest rate reductions. This assertion came hours after his unprecedented attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, citing unproven mortgage fraud allegations, a move Cook is challenging legally. Trump publicly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, blaming high rates for hindering the housing market and vowing to rectify the situation quickly. The central bank, in turn, emphasized that the long, fixed terms and removal protections for governors are vital safeguards ensuring monetary policy is based on economic data and the nation's long-term interests, while affirming it will comply with any judicial decision.</p>

          <p>Attorneys filed a $1-million damage claim against the Trump administration, alleging the unconstitutional racial profiling and false arrest of a 15-year-old U.S. citizen with disabilities by ICE agents outside Arleta High School. The family claims agents drew weapons and handcuffed the boy, mistakenly believing he was a criminal suspect, despite his mother's protests. The Department of Homeland Security denied racial profiling and targeting the school, stating agents were pursuing an unauthorized immigrant cousin, who was later arrested. School officials and the family described the incident as traumatic for the teen, renewing concerns about federal immigration enforcement near schools.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, investors reacted by betting on lower short-term interest rates but higher long-term rates, leading to a steeper yield curve. Cook's attorney stated Trump lacks authority for the removal, which she will challenge legally. This event is seen as Trump's attempt to influence the Fed's independence and push for rate cuts, potentially making the central bank less attentive to inflation. The U.S. dollar also declined. Investors are now closely watching upcoming economic reports, particularly the personal consumption expenditures price index, for further clues on inflation and future rate decisions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's move to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who vows to fight the decision legally, has ignited a significant debate over the central bank's independence. Trump, who has long pressured the Fed for lower interest rates, is now aiming to reshape its board with politically aligned appointees. Historically, the Fed operates independently to ensure stable prices and maximum employment, free from political influence, which is crucial for economic stability and global investor confidence. Experts warn that political interference could lead to inflation and market instability. The financial markets' initial muted reaction is seen by some as underpricing the potential long-term risks to the Fed's credibility.</p>

          <p>The future trajectory of gold prices in September is uncertain, influenced by inflation trends and potential Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. Gold prices have surged significantly in 2024 but recently dipped from a record high. A decline in August inflation could lead to lower gold prices due to a reduced need for alternative assets, while an anticipated Fed rate cut in September might cause prices to rise, as historically lower rates increase gold demand. Investors seeking inflation hedges or portfolio diversification are advised to consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging or fractional investments, as gold's long-term trend remains upward despite short-term fluctuations.

Duffy emphasized that English proficiency is a safety issue, crucial for understanding road signs and communicating with law enforcement.

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly defended his controversial proposal to admit hundreds of thousands of Chinese students to the U.S., pushing back against growing anger from his political base. Trump asserted that America is "honored" to host these students and cautioned that without them, the nation's college system would "go to hell very quickly." He dismissed the criticism as "insulting," linking the policy to his positive relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and a broader strategy of engagement. Trump emphasized that robust security screenings are conducted and highlighted Secretary of State Marco Rubio's support for appropriate oversight, portraying the policy as mutually beneficial for both nations and vital for American higher education.</p>

          <p>The parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, Jake Haro (32) and Rebecca Haro (41), have been charged with murder with malice and making a false police report, just twelve days after they claimed their son vanished from a parking lot. Authorities now presume the infant is deceased, having found inconsistencies in Rebecca Haro's account of an alleged attack. This development is further complicated by Jake Haro's 2023 child abuse conviction involving a previous daughter, who sustained severe injuries. Child protective services have since removed a 2-year-old child from the couple's home. Despite the charges, the Haros maintain their innocence, while investigators intensify efforts to locate Emmanuel's remains.</p>

          <p>For individuals with $100,000 to save, comparing Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts is crucial for maximizing interest earnings while protecting principal. CDs offer fixed interest rates for a set term, providing predictable returns, whereas high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that can fluctuate. Analysis shows that depending on the term length, either option could yield slightly more interest, though CD earnings are guaranteed, unlike the variable rates of high-yield accounts. Savers must weigh the predictability of CDs against the potential for higher, but uncertain, returns from high-yield accounts, and consider early withdrawal penalties for CDs.

          <p>An Italian master painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, stolen by Nazis from Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker 80 years ago, has been located in an estate agent advertisement for a house in Argentina. The artwork, listed on a database of lost wartime art, was spotted in a property once owned by Friedrich Kadgien, a senior Nazi official who fled to South America after World War II. Goudstikker's daughter-in-law, Marei von Saher, who recovered 202 pieces of his collection in 2006, is now seeking to reclaim this missing painting. The discovery offers a rare glimpse into the enduring legacy of Nazi art theft and ongoing efforts for restitution.</p>

While the Ukrainian DeepState mapping project indicates Russia now occupies two villages inside Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine's general staff denies this, stating they "continue to control" one village and are engaged in active hostilities in another. This territorial incursion represents a blow to Ukrainian morale, occurring amidst stalled diplomatic efforts to end the war and warnings from the EU against conceding territory to Russia.</p>

Trump aims to replace outgoing governors with politically aligned appointees to secure a majority on the board.

          <p>A Utah judge has mandated the state legislature redraw its congressional map, ruling that the 2021 lines violated redistricting standards and a citizen initiative against partisan gerrymandering. This decision could open a winnable seat for Democrats in the heavily Republican state, which currently has four GOP representatives. The ruling comes amidst broader national redistricting battles, with President Trump pushing Texas to redraw maps for Republican gains, and California Democrats retaliating with their own proposals. Indiana and Missouri are also becoming battlegrounds, highlighting a nationwide effort by both parties to manipulate electoral maps for partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced a historic achievement, seizing over 76,000 pounds of illegal drugs—approximately 61,740 pounds of cocaine and 14,400 pounds of marijuana—off the Florida coast. This marks the largest drug offload in the agency's 110-year history, with an estimated street value of $473 million. Rear Admiral Adam Chamie highlighted the immense threat posed by transnational drug trafficking, noting the seized cocaine alone represents 23 million lethal doses. The seizures resulted from 19 interdictions in international waters between June and August, involving multiple U.S. and Dutch naval assets. The Coast Guard is intensifying its counter-drug operations to protect the nation from illicit trafficking.</p>
