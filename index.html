          <p>The city of St. Louis experienced a devastating tornado with no warning from the city's sirens, resulting in five deaths and numerous injuries. Mayor Cara Spencer placed the city’s emergency manager on administrative leave pending an investigation into the failure to activate the warning system. The Fire Department's backup system was also broken. The mayor has since changed the siren activation protocol, giving the Fire Department sole responsibility to activate the siren from an office that is staffed at all times.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Could Shift Which Local Police Agencies Get Federal Grants</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is changing the priorities for a Justice Department grant program, shifting focus from initiatives that help "underserved populations" and build trust to programs that focus on "immigration and border security" and "violent crime prevention." The new instructions also prioritize projects that "uplift the image of the law enforcement profession." This shift raises concerns about the future funding of community violence intervention programs and may encourage police to give less priority to certain programs.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un harshly criticized a warship accident during its launch, calling it a “criminal act” caused by carelessness. The incident, involving a 5,000-ton destroyer, resulted in a loss of balance and damage to the ship's bottom. Kim emphasized the need for immediate restoration, framing it as a political issue directly related to the state's authority. South Korea's military confirmed the warship was lying sideways after the failed launch.</p>
