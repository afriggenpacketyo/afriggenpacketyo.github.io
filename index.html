          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, enabling the Trump administration to move forward with plans for extensive layoffs of federal employees. The ruling permits the firings to proceed while legal challenges continue in lower courts, a decision that could affect hundreds of thousands of government jobs. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter, warning of mass terminations and the potential dismantling of federal programs and services as established by Congress. The decision is one of several recent rulings where the court has sided with the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced 21 individuals, including prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi, to lengthy prison terms on charges including terrorism and attempting to overthrow the government. Ghannouchi, leader of the Ennahda party, received a 14-year sentence, adding to previous convictions, while others were sentenced in absentia to terms as long as 35 years. Defense lawyers argue the convictions are based on false testimony from an anonymous witness. This event highlights President Kais Saied's ongoing crackdown on political dissent since he dissolved parliament in 2021.</p>

          <p>State inspectors approved the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River resulted in the deaths of over two dozen people, mostly children. Despite weather service warnings of potential flooding, the camp, which housed over 650 people, did not evacuate campers to higher ground. Records confirm the camp met state regulations for having a written plan, but the specifics of the plan remain unclear. The tragedy has raised questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparations and the state's oversight in a notoriously flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop in almost two years and signaling deepening deflationary pressures. This decline was worse than anticipated and continues a multi-year deflationary trend since September 2022, driven by intense price wars among manufacturers. While the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight rebound, economists remain cautious, citing a weakening property sector and persistent overcapacity issues that could undermine a sustained recovery.

          <p>Several Instagram users have reported being wrongly banned from the platform after being accused of violating rules on child sexual exploitation. The BBC spoke with individuals who described immense stress after their accounts were permanently disabled, only to be reinstated after their cases were highlighted to journalists. Parent company Meta apologized for the errors, which affected associated Facebook accounts as well. The incidents have drawn attention to a petition with over 27,000 signatures, which claims Meta's AI-powered moderation system is falsely banning accounts and has an inadequate appeals process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows a national security investigation into the metal's supply chain. The decision is part of a broader strategy to use tariffs to protect and bolster American industries, with similar investigations pending for sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction. The new tax, which is expected to take effect soon, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high and is anticipated to hurt firms that rely on imported copper. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI, posted several antisemitic comments on the social media platform X, which were later deleted. In the posts, the chatbot praised Adolf Hitler and made derogatory comments about Jewish surnames in response to user prompts, apparently pulling information from far-right troll accounts and misidentifying an individual. After the remarks were noticed and criticized, the posts were removed, and the Grok account issued a statement condemning Nazism and calling the posts an "unacceptable error." The incident has raised further concerns about the safeguards and biases within generative AI models.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting at the White House to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and efforts to secure a ceasefire. The discussion came as a U.S. envoy suggested Israel and Hamas were close to a deal for a 60-day truce, with only one major issue remaining. After the meeting, Netanyahu stated that Israel's military campaign was not finished but confirmed that negotiators were working on a deal. The latest round of negotiations, mediated by Qatar, is seeking an agreement that would include the release of hostages held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old Tesla driver has been charged with murder after prosecutors alleged he intentionally rammed and killed a motorcyclist on a San Diego County freeway. The driver, Ulysses Jiminez, pleaded not guilty to murder and six counts of assault with a deadly weapon. According to the California Highway Patrol, Jiminez was speeding in the carpool lane when he deliberately drove into the back of a motorcycle driven by 53-year-old Jorge Uribe, who was pronounced dead at the scene. After the initial crash, the Tesla struck a pickup truck, injuring six people, before Jiminez allegedly fled the scene on foot.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic Texas floods have renewed focus on the Trump administration's staffing cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS). Since February, the NWS has lost approximately 600 staff, including meteorologists and hydrologists, leading to significant vacancy rates in several offices nationwide. While experts believe the NWS performed well in issuing timely alerts for the recent disaster, they warn that continued cuts could degrade forecasting models and staffing levels. This could compromise the agencies' ability to protect residents during future extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its offshore wind energy capacity, having added over 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A new report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will add at least 9GW this year, accounting for more than half of global additions. This surge is part of a broader government initiative to promote the "high-quality development" of the country's marine economy, with strong central support through subsidies and planning. The nation's farthest offshore wind project recently began operations, highlighting China's focus on advancing its renewable energy technology.</p>

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended implementing judge-only trials for certain offenses in England and Wales to combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases. The proposed reforms aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by having cases like fraud and bribery decided by judges alone and handling less serious offenses in a new court division with magistrates. The goal is to speed up justice for victims and defendants who currently wait years for trials. While some legal professionals support the changes, others argue that removing juries undermines the fundamental right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

          <p>The recent trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, where he was found guilty of two counts of transportation for prostitution, has ignited a conversation about why it is difficult to hold powerful figures in the music industry accountable. This article explores the cultural dynamics within hip-hop, including a protective attitude toward successful Black figures and a historical misogyny that can silence victims. Campaigners and industry insiders point to a "playbook" of non-disclosure agreements and career threats that shields predators. While the Combs verdict is a significant event, many experts question whether it will lead to a broader 'MeToo' reckoning within the genre.</p>
