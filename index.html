          <p>During the annual Shri Lairai Zatra festival in Goa, India, a stampede at a Hindu temple resulted in at least six deaths and over 50 injuries. The incident occurred amidst a large gathering of devotees from Goa and neighboring states who were participating in religious ceremonies. Despite a significant security presence, the frenzy during the rituals led to the stampede, prompting authorities to launch an investigation. Political leaders have extended condolences and promised support to the affected families, while health officials are providing medical assistance to the injured, with some in critical condition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies in Friede's blood have demonstrated protection against fatal doses from various snake species in animal trials, offering a potential universal antivenom. Friede endured over 200 bites and 700 venom injections from deadly snakes like mambas and cobras, initially aiming to build immunity. Researchers identified broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood, leading to a cocktail that saved mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 venomous snake species, marking a significant step towards a universal antivenom.</p>

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. The museum, which houses treasures evacuated from mainland China, saw a record high of 6.14 million visitors in 2016, including 3.32 million from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. However, in 2024, only 50,000 visitors came from these regions, with South Korea and Japan providing the largest overseas groups. The museum's director aims to attract 3.5 million visitors in 2025, despite the ongoing cross-strait tensions and travel restrictions.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges and evolving global dynamics, with the ruling Labor Party led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seeking a second term against opposition leader Peter Dutton.

While recent polls suggest a Labor victory, dissatisfaction with both major parties is driving support towards independent candidates.

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has been implemented in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. This new tariff, following a similar tax on imported cars, aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, though analysts predict higher costs and prices for businesses and consumers. While some companies have reported sales surges due to concerns about price hikes, others have warned of significant new costs and withdrawn financial guidance, citing extreme uncertainties. The tariffs do not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that comply with the free trade agreement, and measures have been introduced to ease the burden on carmakers.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political strife after former President Nana Akufo-Addo allocated $58 million in public funds to it. The project, intended as a national monument, is now a large, water-filled hole surrounded by aging construction materials. The new government has halted funding and launched an anticorruption initiative targeting the project. Critics argue that the funds could have been better used to address Ghana's economic crisis, while supporters defend the project as a future profit-making venture.</p>

          <p>World, a start-up co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI, has launched in the United States with the goal of verifying human identity online using iris scans. The company's program, World ID, aims to differentiate between humans and AI bots in online interactions. Users receive a unique biometric identifier and cryptocurrency called Worldcoin in exchange for scanning their irises using a device called the Orb. While the project has gained traction in developing countries, it faces privacy concerns and skepticism in the US, with some questioning the need for a global biometric registry.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which are expected to increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. President Trump initiated these tariffs to promote domestic manufacturing. The tariffs will affect all vehicles, including those made in the United States, as they often use imported parts. While Canada and Mexico are exempt, the tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and create financial stress for suppliers, potentially leading to parts shortages.</p>

          <p>South Africa faces dual climate change challenges: rising sea levels and drought-induced ground uplift. Research indicates that water loss from drought may be causing parts of the country to lift by two millimeters annually, counteracting the effects of rising seas. Coastal cities are experiencing shoreline erosion and flooding, while the interior suffers from water scarcity. While the ground uplift may seem beneficial, experts caution that it comes at the expense of less water availability, emphasizing the need for integrated climate and ocean policies.</p>
