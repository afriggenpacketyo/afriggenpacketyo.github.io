          <h2>China's Homestay Sector Faces Downturn as Operators Lament Intensified Price Wars and Thinning Profits</h2>

          <p>China's private holiday accommodation sector, including homestays and guesthouses, is experiencing a significant downturn, leaving operators like Chen Mei regretting their investments. Following a brief "revenge travel" boom post-pandemic, a surge in supply, coupled with falling guest spending, led to intensified price wars and squeezed profits. A Fastdata report indicated that nearly 60% of operators regretted entering the market, with many finding themselves working for minimal wages despite substantial initial investments. This highlights a classic boom-and-bust cycle, leaving many entrepreneurs in a difficult financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

Guo, attempting to be the first to fly solo to all seven continents, was detained in June for allegedly landing his Cessna without permission and presenting "false flight plan data." He described his detention as "mundane" but praised Chilean hospitality. Charges were dropped, but he must donate raised funds to a cancer charity and is banned from Chile for three years.

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, defeating home favorite Amanda Anisimova in a tense straight-sets final. Sabalenka, who had lost two Grand Slam finals earlier in the year, showcased improved emotional composure to win 6-3, 7-6 (7-3). This victory marks her fourth Grand Slam singles title and makes her the first woman since Serena Williams to achieve back-to-back US Open wins. The Belarusian's tactical approach involved absorbing Anisimova's power and forcing errors, ultimately leading to a dominant tie-break performance.</p>

          <p>Schools across 35 U.S. states are implementing cellphone bans, with many adopting Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce the rules, affecting at least 2.5 million students. Students place their phones in these pouches, which are locked upon entering school and unlocked upon leaving, aiming to reduce distractions and foster a more engaged learning environment. While some students welcome the change, others seek ways to bypass the system. The initiative, costing districts thousands, seeks to create "phone-free spaces" and help students experience life outside a "fully digital realm," despite initial challenges and debates over budget allocation.</p>

Reeves is expected to resist increased borrowing, implying potential higher taxes or spending cuts to address any fiscal gaps.

The Jebeleya tribe has seen homes demolished with little compensation, and a controversial court ruling challenged St Catherine's Monastery's land ownership.

          <p>Singapore faces an existential threat from rising sea levels, projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by 2100, with potential surges reaching 5 meters during extreme weather. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized these as "life and death matters" for the island nation, where 30% of land is less than 5 meters above sea level. Unlike larger countries, Singapore cannot retreat and must protect critical infrastructure along its coasts. The nation plans to invest billions in land reclamation, seawalls, barriers, and tidal gates to defend against this climate change impact, alongside global efforts in clean energy and wetland restoration.</p>

          <p>Chicago is divided over President Trump's threats to deploy the National Guard to combat crime and enhance immigration enforcement, following similar moves in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Local officials, including Governor JB Pritzker, have vowed to resist the deployment, calling Trump "unhinged." While violent crime rates in Chicago have fallen over the past two years, residents in high-crime areas express mixed feelings, with some community leaders arguing that local initiatives are already addressing violence and that federal troops are not the solution. The city's large Latino population also fears increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, leading to the postponement of Mexican Independence Day celebrations.</p>
