        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli military forces have conducted strikes against Syrian government targets in Damascus and southern Syria amid escalating sectarian violence in the Suweida province. The conflict, which has reportedly resulted in over 300 casualties, involves clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, prompting Israeli intervention to protect the Druze population. In response to the growing crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to end the violence, a move welcomed by Syria's foreign ministry. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Suweida has severely deteriorated, with shortages of essential supplies and attacks on medical facilities.</p>

          <p>A lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey, resulted in the death of one person and injuries to thirteen others. The incident occurred during a children's archery competition, where a 61-year-old club member, Robert Montgomery, was fatally struck while volunteering. According to an instructor, the strike happened unexpectedly without any prior signs of a storm, causing the ground to explode and knocking several people down. The injured individuals, including a 7-year-old, were transported to local hospitals for treatment. This event marks at least the third recent lightning-related incident in the Tri-State Area.</p>

          <h2>Seven & i Holdings Shares Fall Sharply After Couche-Tard Withdraws $47 Billion Acquisition Offer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 23:04:51 EDT</div>

          <p>Shares of Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings dropped over 7% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover bid. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. Seven & i expressed disappointment, refuting the Canadian firm's claims and stating the withdrawal was unilateral. The collapse of the deal, which some analysts believe was unlikely due to Japanese protectionism, highlights the challenges of foreign acquisitions of major Japanese corporations considered vital to the national interest.

          <p>The Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, visited Angola to support the Halo Trust, a charity dedicated to clearing landmines, continuing the legacy of his mother, Princess Diana. He emphasized the ongoing danger that landmines pose to civilians, particularly children, long after conflicts have ended. Princess Diana's famous walk through an Angolan minefield in 1997 brought global attention to the issue and supported an international ban on landmines. The Halo Trust has cleared 120,000 mines in Angola, but an estimated thousand minefields remain, highlighting the continued importance of the charity's work in the region.</p>

Her termination occurs in the context of her father's own firing by President Trump in 2017 and his ongoing investigation by the Justice Department, raising questions about the political motivations behind the decision.</p>

          <p>A street vendor in Los Angeles, identified as Marta, shares her experience of living and working in constant fear following a wave of mass immigration raids that began in early June. Having previously felt that California was a sanctuary state, she now feels that all migrants must be on alert. The fear has impacted her livelihood, forcing her to temporarily stop working and causing her U.S.-born children to take on jobs to support the family. Her story reflects the broader anxiety within the immigrant community, where the threat of deportation has disrupted daily life, reduced economic activity, and forced families to make contingency plans for separation.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the second straight month in June, falling 0.5% year-over-year and intensifying fears that the export-reliant economy could enter a technical recession. The decline was driven by significant drops in shipments to major partners, with exports to the U.S. falling by 11.4% and to China by 4.7%. This downturn comes as Japan faces a 25% U.S. tariff on its imports, with no trade deal in sight. Automakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share, as export values have plummeted despite a rise in volumes, putting severe pressure on corporate margins.

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst" criminals, newly obtained data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows a different reality. Of the approximately 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions, and a majority of infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. The data, broken down by conviction type, indicates that while 70,583 deportees were convicted criminals, many of their offenses were non-violent. This analysis suggests the administration's deportation push has ensnared many undocumented immigrants without the severe criminal records often highlighted in public messaging.</p>

Following the Pentagon's order to withdraw half the troops from Los Angeles, Newsom argued their utilization rate was extremely low, making them a "solution in search of a problem." He accused the administration of terrorizing communities rather than pursuing violent criminals. Newsom also repeated a threat to redraw California's electoral maps to favor Democrats if Republicans proceed with similar efforts in other states to secure their power.</p>

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids on workplaces are exposing significant flaws in the E-Verify system, which over a million employers use to confirm employment eligibility. A raid on a Nebraska meat processing facility resulted in the arrest of over 70 employees, despite the owner's assertion that he used E-Verify correctly. Experts argue the system is easily fooled because it vets documents, not people, making it susceptible to identity theft and creating a false sense of security for employers. While USCIS defends the system's accuracy, critics call it a "wink-and-nod" program that allows politicians to appear tough on immigration without imposing major economic costs.</p>

          <p>In a rare show of bipartisanship, Congress has passed legislation to help thousands of military veterans avoid foreclosure on their homes. The bill provides a crucial fix after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) abruptly ended a homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with few affordable options to catch up on missed mortgage payments. The new law will allow veterans to move their delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current and preventing foreclosure. This action addresses a crisis that left many veterans, who typically have access to favorable loan programs, in a more precarious position than most other American homeowners.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the termination of a key FEMA program for natural disaster mitigation. The lawsuit argues that the executive branch acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision they contend rests with Congress. The states claim the cuts are devastating, forcing the delay or cancellation of hundreds of local infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from floods and other disasters. A recent analysis revealed that two-thirds of the counties losing funding from the program's termination had voted for President Trump in 2024.</p>

A cockpit recording reportedly indicates that the captain moved the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff, prompting the first officer to question the action. A preliminary report confirmed the fuel switches were moved but did not state how. Without fuel, the Boeing 787 lost thrust and was too low to recover, crashing shortly after. The evidence suggests a possible crew-related cause, rekindling debate over the implementation of cockpit image recorders.</p>

Prices vary significantly by region, with some areas seeing increases of up to 13% since last year, driven by high demand and a shortage of cheaper council-run options. Families are struggling with the financial burden, as the cost is comparable to a family vacation, yet it is a necessity for working parents. The system of receiving childcare benefits in arrears further complicates matters for low-income families who must pay the high costs upfront.</p>

He argued that while some economic data could justify a rate cut, signs of inflation remain, and Powell has no reason to act other than to stop political pressure. Cramer concluded that firing the Fed chair would rock the stock market and raise interest rates, outcomes no president would want. (not investment advice)</p>
