          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is causing significant disruptions, including staff shortages among air traffic controllers, leading to flight suspensions at airports like Burbank. The Senate has again failed to pass funding legislation, prolonging the stalemate. Amid the shutdown, President Trump announced new tariffs on imported trucks and claimed to be negotiating with Democrats, a statement which Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer immediately refuted as untrue, though he affirmed Democrats' willingness to talk if the President is serious.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges the long-held belief about why Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship, the Endurance, sank in Antarctic ice in 1915. Finnish researcher Jukka Tuhkuri argues that the vessel's demise was caused by fundamental structural weaknesses rather than solely the immense pressure of the sea ice. The research, based on historical documents and structural analysis, suggests the ship was built for Arctic conditions and lacked necessary reinforcements, like cross-beams in the engine room, making it vulnerable to the compressive forces of Antarctic pack ice.</p>

          <p>Bill Nye, CEO of the Planetary Society, led a protest on Capitol Hill against proposed 25% budget cuts to NASA for fiscal year 2026. Nye warned that such cuts would force the United States to "cede leadership to other countries," particularly China, in the new space race. He emphasized that dozens of critical missions, including the Artemis moon program and Mars sample-return efforts, would be jeopardized. Nye argued that NASA's budget is a tiny fraction of federal spending and provides an extraordinary economic return, making the investment priceless for scientific progress.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Mexico, with forecasts predicting it could become a Category 2 or even approach major hurricane status. The National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm watches for parts of Baja California Sur and the mainland coast. While the storm's center is expected to remain offshore, its outer bands are projected to bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and life-threatening surf and rip currents to the region. This poses a significant risk of flash flooding, especially in higher terrain areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would consider a presidential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, after the Supreme Court denied her appeal. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump claimed he hadn't "heard the name in so long" but would look into the matter. He also revealed that hip-hop mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, recently convicted on federal prostitution charges, has also requested a pardon. The comments have renewed scrutiny of the President's relationships and use of clemency powers.</p>

          <p>The chairman of Citic argues that Hong Kong's role as an international financial hub should not be limited to connecting mainland China with the world, but should expand to serve the entire Asia-Pacific region. He highlighted the city's potential to attract listings and capital for top companies from India, Southeast Asia, and developed markets like Japan. This vision is supported by Hong Kong's deep fundraising pool and unique advantages under the "one country, two systems" framework. The comments come as significant capital from the mainland continues to flow into the city's markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index achieved a record high for the second day in a row, driven by a rally in technology stocks on Wall Street. The surge was largely fueled by chipmaker AMD's stock skyrocketing after announcing a significant deal with OpenAI, which is seen as a major challenge to competitor Nvidia. This positive momentum in the tech sector lifted Japanese chip-related stocks like Advantest and Tokyo Electron. The record also follows the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of Japan's ruling party. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, President Trump stated he would use the act if necessary, while his administration defended the raids as lawful enforcement actions against violent attacks on federal agents.

          <p>As Beijing begins drafting its 15th five-year plan, a key challenge will be restoring the confidence of entrepreneurs in the country's private sector. Many private firms have been struggling with sluggish demand, intense price competition, and unpredictable regulatory actions. Despite government measures intended to support them, a majority of businesses still describe the climate as difficult. The upcoming five-year plan will be critical in determining whether China's leaders can create a stable and competitive environment to prevent a potential wave of bankruptcies and revive the private economy.

          <p>Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier has publicly condemned WNBA leadership, particularly Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, accusing the league of failing to address player safety concerns and showing a lack of accountability. Collier's statement comes at a critical time for the WNBA, which is experiencing record growth but is also in the midst of tense labor negotiations. Players are demanding higher salaries and a greater share of revenue. Collier shared details of a private conversation where she felt the commissioner was dismissive of player value, reflecting a deeply soured relationship between the players and the league office.</p>

          <p>Brian K. Williams, who served as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass’s deputy mayor of public safety, has been sentenced to one year of probation and 50 hours of community service for making a false bomb threat. Williams admitted to calling in the threat against City Hall last October, telling a judge the act stemmed from severe stress and "undiagnosed mental health challenges" following a series of personal tragedies. Prosecutors noted the act was an aberration in a long career of public service and was motivated by a desperate attempt to get out of a meeting, not by any political agenda.</p>

          <p>Officials in Arkansas have shot and killed a black bear they believe was responsible for the fatal mauling of a 60-year-old camper in the Ozark National Forest. The victim, Max Thomas of Missouri, was found deceased at his campsite after his family reported him missing. The man had sent photos of a bear in his camp shortly before the attack. After a trail camera captured an image of a matching bear near the site, local hunters and hounds tracked and killed the animal for DNA confirmation, marking the second fatal bear attack in the state in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>Top advisors to President Trump, including Stephen Miller, have intensified their rhetoric, labeling political opposition as "a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism." Miller asserted that the "only remedy is to use legitimate state power to dismantle" these perceived terror networks. This language coincides with the administration's controversial deployment of federal forces to cities like Portland and a government shutdown being used by OMB Director Russ Vought as a pretext to fire federal workers. The rhetoric signals an increasingly extreme approach to political opponents and governance.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced plans to abolish the Sentencing Council, the independent body that creates sentencing guidelines for courts in England and Wales. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick stated the council is "not fit for purpose" and that a Conservative government would give ministers direct power to issue these guidelines instead. The move aims to ensure that sentencing policy is set by elected parliamentarians who are accountable to the public. This proposal follows a recent dispute between the current Labour government and the council over guidance for pre-sentence reports.</p>

          <p>A career federal prosecutor in Virginia has reportedly concluded there is not enough probable cause to bring criminal mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. The case, which was initiated after a referral from a Trump ally, has been the subject of intense pressure from the President. This development sets up a potential confrontation within the Justice Department, as the prosecutor's conclusion must be presented to the new U.S. Attorney for the district, a Trump ally who was installed after her predecessor also declined to pursue charges against one of the President's political rivals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's decision to give up its "developing country" status and associated privileges at the World Trade Organization (WTO) is being interpreted as a strategic retreat rather than a concession. For years, the U.S. and E.U. have criticized China, a high-tech export powerhouse, for claiming benefits meant for poorer nations. By voluntarily relinquishing these special treatments, Beijing removes a key point of contention for its critics while giving up very little of substance. This move allows China to reframe its position on the global stage and better align itself with the Global South for long-term political advantage.</p>

          <p>The number of students arriving in the U.S. from Asia in August fell by nearly 24% compared to the previous year, reaching the lowest level on record outside of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The August arrival numbers are a key indicator of fall semester enrollment for U.S. schools. The trend suggests a significant shift in international student mobility, with many current students also choosing to remain in the U.S. during breaks.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's recent dealmaking with chipmakers AMD and Nvidia highlights the intensifying arms race in artificial intelligence, according to investor Brad Gerstner. He cautioned that these announcements are not yet deployments and that ultimately, "the best chips will win" in a world that will remain constrained by computing power availability. The partnerships are seen as a critical step for OpenAI to build more complex AI models and stay ahead of global competitors, particularly Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The competition underscores the geopolitical importance of leadership in AI technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in the UK have arrested 18 suspects and dismantled what they believe is an international criminal gang responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China in the past year. The massive operation was triggered after a single victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, where police discovered a shipment of nearly 900 phones. The investigation revealed a sophisticated network where street thieves were paid for stolen handsets, which were then exported and sold for a massive profit, fueling a rise in phone thefts in London.</p>
