          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:13:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university spot, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This leniency is attributed to financial uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment, making domestic undergraduates a more stable source of income for institutions. The trend emerges as UK universities face significant financial strain, with over 40% expecting to be in a deficit. Concurrently, tuition fees for domestic students are set to rise for the first time since 2017, from £9,250 to £9,535 for the upcoming academic year.</p>

          <p>Food delivery company DoorDash announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, causing its stock to climb approximately 8% in extended trading. The company reported earnings of 65 cents per share on revenue of $3.28 billion, beating the expected 44 cents per share and $3.16 billion in revenue. This represents a 25% year-over-year revenue increase, with the company achieving a net income of $285 million compared to a loss in the same period last year. The positive report reflects a 20% rise in total orders and a 23% increase in gross order value. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The quantity of empty homes in England is increasing, with over 700,000 properties currently vacant, of which more than 264,000 are considered long-term empty. This trend raises significant concerns for local communities, who report issues like pest infestations, crime, and urban decay, as highlighted by a case in Bristol where a derelict house has become a source of fear for neighbors. Housing charities view these empty properties as a missed opportunity amid a national housing shortage and rising homelessness. Local government leaders are calling for enhanced legal powers to more easily take control of and repurpose these vacant homes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:02:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to lower its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, a move that would mark its lowest point since March 2023. This potential cut is seen as a response to a stagnating UK economy, which experienced no growth in April and May. While the decision would likely reduce mortgage costs for some homeowners, it would also mean lower returns for savers. The anticipated rate reduction comes even as inflation, at 3.6%, remains above the Bank's 2% target, though signs of a cooling job market may be influencing the central bank's strategy.

          <p>Italy has approved the construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, a $15.5 billion project that will connect the island of Sicily to the mainland. The bridge is designed to be the world's longest suspension bridge, spanning over two miles and capable of handling 6,000 cars per hour and 200 trains daily. The project, first proposed in 1969, has been revived by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's administration after decades of debate. Opponents raise significant concerns about potential infiltration by organized crime, environmental impact, and seismic risks from the active Messina fault line, which caused a devastating earthquake in 1908.</p>

          <p>Following an attempted carjacking and assault on a former government staffer in Washington D.C., President Trump stated he is considering taking federal control of the city's police force. Trump suggested he might bring in the National Guard and that his lawyers are studying the possibility of overturning D.C.'s home rule, which has granted the city limited self-government for 50 years. While violent crime in D.C. has recently declined from a 2023 peak, the incident has provided a political opportunity for the administration to act on previous threats. Experts note that while Trump cannot unilaterally federalize the district, a Republican-controlled Congress could potentially pass legislation to do so.</p>

          <p>A grand jury has indicted Elias Rodriguez, the man accused of fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy employees in Washington D.C., on federal hate crime charges. The indictment for the May 21 attack, which killed Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, includes special findings that allow the Justice Department to potentially seek the death penalty. According to charging documents, after the shooting, Rodriguez told police, "I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza." The suspect, who legally purchased the firearm in Illinois, had traveled to D.C. for a work conference before the attack occurred outside the Capital Jewish Museum.</p>

          <p>New archaeological research suggests that people returned to live in Pompeii after its catastrophic destruction by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Evidence indicates that some survivors, possibly unable to afford relocating, established a precarious settlement among the ruins, living in the upper floors of buried homes. This informal community, which may have also attracted others seeking shelter, appears to have persisted until the 5th century. The findings challenge the long-held perception of Pompeii as a completely abandoned city, revealing a previously overlooked chapter of resilience and reoccupation in its history.</p>

This measure will raise the total tariff rate on Indian goods to 50% and is set to take effect on August 27. The White House stated the move was necessary to counter Russia's actions in Ukraine, which it says are undermined by India's oil imports. India's foreign ministry has called the tariff "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," arguing that it began importing Russian oil after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe at the start of the conflict.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump, while frequently claiming elections are rigged against him, is himself engaging in practices designed to manipulate political and governmental systems. The author points to the president's recent efforts to pressure Republican-led states like Texas into mid-decade redistricting to create more favorable congressional maps for the 2026 midterms. The piece also cites attempts to interfere with nonpartisan economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the use of presidential power to impose tariffs. The author contends that these actions represent a hypocritical pattern of projecting his own behavior onto his political opponents.</p>

          <p>A hotel in the Chicago area housing some of the Texas Democratic lawmakers who left their state to block a redistricting bill was evacuated due to a bomb threat. Police conducted a thorough search of the St. Charles, Illinois hotel and found no device, allowing guests to return safely. The more than 50 Democrats fled Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass new congressional maps that could give the GOP up to five more seats. The incident has intensified an already tense political standoff, with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker vowing that state police will investigate and hold those responsible accountable.</p>

          <p>England all-rounder Chris Woakes has been lauded for his courage after choosing to bat with a suspected dislocated shoulder during the final day of a Test match against India. Woakes, who suffered the injury on the first day, emerged at number 11 with his arm in a sling when England needed 17 runs to win. Although he did not face a ball, he managed to run four crucial runs before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run victory for India. Woakes stated he couldn't live with himself if he didn't try, feeling a duty to his team and the fans.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County could be significantly higher than the 31 deaths officially recorded. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. estimates there were 440 more deaths than typically expected during the period of the fires. Researchers argue that official counts often miss fatalities indirectly caused by disasters, such as those from poor air quality or disruptions to healthcare services. The study highlights the challenge of quantifying the full human cost of climate-driven events beyond immediate, directly attributable deaths.</p>

The bombings on August 6 and 9, 1945, led to Japan's surrender in World War II and caused an estimated 210,000 deaths by the end of that year. Structures like the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, now the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, stand as enduring symbols of the destruction and the cities' resilience. At a ceremony, Hiroshima's mayor warned that current global conflicts threaten to undermine peacebuilding efforts learned from the tragedy.</p>

Citing the volatility and uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, E.l.f. declined to provide a full-year financial forecast.

          <p>A comparison of savings options shows that a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) currently offers a slightly higher and more secure return than a money market account for a $10,000 deposit. With current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn approximately $220, while a money market account at 4.32% would yield about $214. The key difference is that the CD rate is locked for the term, guaranteeing the return. In contrast, money market account rates are variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, potentially widening the earnings gap in favor of the CD.

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking a nearly $10 billion rate increase over the next four years, a proposal that advocates claim would be the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the hike is essential to ensure grid reliability, diversify energy sources like solar, and cover storm restoration costs. However, environmental and consumer groups are pushing back, arguing the increase will exacerbate the state's affordability crisis and disproportionately funnel profits to shareholders. If approved by the Florida Public Service Commission, the hike could raise an average customer's bill by over $360 by the end of 2027.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's attempts to shift media focus away from the Jeffrey Epstein story and his connection to the late sex offender. The author argues that the president's tactics—including ordering supporters to stop discussing it, creating distractions, and selectively releasing information—have often had the opposite effect, fueling more suspicion and scrutiny. For example, the release of what was claimed to be "raw" jail footage was later reported to be spliced, and a denial of writing a letter to Epstein was weakened by other inconsistencies. These actions, the author suggests, only serve to heighten public curiosity and intrigue.</p>

White had disappeared while on a fishing trip, with only his empty boat, a shoe, and a hat found at the time. A five-day search yielded no further evidence.
