          <p>The UK government's borrowing for September reached its highest level in five years, totaling £20.2 billion, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase was driven primarily by a significant rise in debt interest payments, which offset higher income from taxes and national insurance. The figures place additional pressure on the Chancellor ahead of the upcoming Budget, as public sector debt remains at levels not seen since the early 1960s, now estimated at 95.3% of GDP.

          <p>A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, titled "Nobody's Girl," provides detailed accounts of her allegations against Prince Andrew, which he has consistently denied. The book, co-written by Amy Wallace, describes three alleged instances where Giuffre says she was forced to have sex with the prince, including one on Jeffrey Epstein's private island. Wallace stated that Giuffre would have considered Prince Andrew's recent decision to relinquish his royal titles a victory and a step toward accountability for the powerful men involved in Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have secured a place in the World Series after defeating the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in a decisive seventh game of the American League Championship Series. Outfielder George Springer hit a crucial three-run home run in the seventh inning to clinch the victory for Major League Baseball's only Canadian team. This marks the Blue Jays' first appearance in the championship since their back-to-back wins in 1992 and 1993, and they will now face the defending champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>

Fiona Goddard and Ellie-Ann Reynolds stepped down over issues including the selection of potential chairs with backgrounds in policing and social work, institutions they feel failed victims previously. They also expressed fears that the inquiry was being secretive, condescending towards survivors, and at risk of being diluted by expanding its scope beyond its original focus.</p>

          <p>Construction crews have started demolishing parts of the White House's East Wing to make way for a new ballroom initiated by President Donald Trump. The project, which the president stated is being privately funded by "generous Patriots," will be a modernized addition near the main structure. The construction has prompted concern from some historians, who note that the project appears to be proceeding without the typically rigorous public review process and vetting that is standard for renovations to the historic executive residence.</p>

          <p>Brazil's government has granted state-run oil company Petrobras a license to drill for oil in the environmentally sensitive Equatorial Margin, near the mouth of the Amazon River. The decision, supported by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as a means to fund the country's climate transition, has drawn sharp condemnation from environmental groups. Critics, including the Climate Observatory network, have labeled the move a "sabotage" of the upcoming COP30 climate summit in Brazil, arguing it contradicts global goals to phase out fossil fuels.</p>
