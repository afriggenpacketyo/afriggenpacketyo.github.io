          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over 30 years in prison. The judge's decision followed emotional testimony from family members who believe the brothers have been rehabilitated and have served enough time. The resentencing was based on their age at the time of the crime and their demonstrated rehabilitation efforts in prison, including starting programs to help other inmates. The parole board will now determine their potential release, considering their risk assessment and conduct in prison.</p>

          <p>Despite public denials, an internal Israeli analysis indicates that Gaza faces a severe food shortage and potential famine if aid deliveries are not restored promptly. Israeli military officials have warned that many areas in Gaza will run out of food within weeks, contradicting the government's stance that the blockade poses no major threat to civilian life. Aid agencies have reported that bakeries are shutting down and food stocks are depleted, exacerbating the crisis. The United Nations Security Council has called on Israel to immediately allow aid into Gaza, highlighting the urgency of the situation.</p>

          <p>Following tariff reductions that suggest a de-escalation of trade tensions between China and the United States, Goldman Sachs and UBS have revised their economic growth forecasts for China. Goldman Sachs increased its forecast for China's real GDP growth this year to 4.6 percent, up from 4 percent, while UBS raised its forecast to between 3.7 percent and 4 percent. These revisions reflect expectations of a smaller shock on China's exports and economic growth due to the trade war de-escalation.

          <p>Mali's military government has dissolved all political parties in the country, a decision announced by Minister of Political Reforms Mamani Nassire. The move follows increasing reports of pro-democracy activists being kidnapped and a recent pro-democracy protest.

The dissolution of political parties has sparked concerns about a wider repression of dissent and a severe blow to the reconciliation process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking to hire lawyers to investigate employee misconduct, including "unauthorized communications with the media." The job posting suggests the agency is looking to expand its crackdown on employees who speak to the press, a move criticized as an attempt to intimidate workers objecting to firings. The majority of USAID employees are slated to be fired as part of an agency-wide downsizing. The agency's actions are part of an ongoing conflict between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and federal workers.</p>

          <p>State Farm will be allowed to temporarily increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California, a decision criticized by consumer advocates and homeowners affected by recent wildfires. Critics argue that the rate hike is unfair and unfounded, especially as many homeowners are still struggling to get their claims paid. State Farm requested the increase following devastating fires, but Consumer Watchdog claims the insurer exaggerated its financial strain. The insurance commissioner defended the decision as a difficult compromise in a statewide insurance crisis.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, promises explosive new details on former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s mental and physical decline while in the White House, with the book detailing how Mr. Biden’s advisers stomped out discussion of his age-related limitations, including internal concerns of aides, external worries of Democratic allies and scrutiny by journalists. The book relies heavily on anonymous sourcing, revealing the enduring chill that Biden’s loyalists have cast over a Democratic Party still afraid to grapple publicly with what many say privately was his waning ability to campaign and serve in office. The book does not contain any astonishing revelation that changes the broad perception of whether Mr. Biden, now 82, was fit to serve as president. (not investment advice)</p>
