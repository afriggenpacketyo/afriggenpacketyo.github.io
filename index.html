Germany is acquiring eight Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, joining NATO allies like the UK, Norway, and the US in monitoring the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea. This increased cooperation aims to counter the heightened strategic threat from Russian submarine activity and protect critical undersea infrastructure.

          <p>Singer Nelly Furtado has announced she is stepping away from live performances for the "foreseeable future" to focus on other personal and creative pursuits. The announcement, made on the 25th anniversary of her debut album "Whoa, Nelly!," follows recent instances where the artist faced online body-shaming. While she will no longer perform, Furtado expressed gratitude for her career and stated she will continue to write music, which she has always considered a beloved hobby.

          <p>A 24-year-old Honduran man, Jose Castro Rivera, was struck and killed by a vehicle on a highway in Norfolk, Virginia, while attempting to flee from ICE agents. This marks at least the third death of an immigrant trying to evade detention during the current administration's intensified immigration enforcement operations. The incident occurred during what a Department of Homeland Security official described as a "targeted, intelligence-based" operation. Critics point to data showing an increasing number of non-criminal immigrants being arrested and detained by ICE.</p>

          <p>Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing in the recent death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, which is being investigated as a possible suicide. Kramnik, who had publicly and repeatedly accused Naroditsky of cheating online without evidence, called his death a tragedy but blamed critics for a "cynical and unlawful campaign of harassment" against him. The international chess community, including top players like Magnus Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura, has widely condemned Kramnik's behavior. The International Chess Federation (Fide) has referred Kramnik's statements to its ethics commission for review.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a difficult start to the Ashes series, losing 26-6 to Australia at Wembley in a performance their coach described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities, allowing Australia to control the match despite a slow start. Australian full-back Reece Walsh was named player of the match for his decisive plays, which starkly contrasted with England's struggles. With the next match in Liverpool, England faces an urgent need to fix fundamental errors to avoid Australia retaining the Ashes with another victory.</p>

          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively buying S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification.

This strategy appears to be effective, as recent polls show the proposition passing by a significant margin, with many voters citing their opposition to Trump as their primary motivation.

          <p>Law enforcement officers discharged their weapons at a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward them outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The incident occurred during a day-long protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. The driver, who was reportedly wounded, drove away after the shooting but later abandoned the vehicle nearby and was taken into custody. The protest had been organized in response to plans to use the base as a staging area for Border Patrol agents, an operation that was later reportedly canceled.</p>

          <p>The historic East Wing of the White House was demolished this week to make way for a new, privately-funded $300 million ballroom, a move initiated by President Donald Trump. The rapid destruction of the structure, which housed the Office of the First Lady and held significant historical value, has been described as shocking by former White House staff and observers. Critics view the action as a disregard for historical preservation and another example of the president acting without concern for traditional norms and checks on executive power. The demolition has raised questions about the authority a president has over such a historic landmark.</p>

          <p>Following the controversial demolition of the White House East Wing, an Atlantic journalist embarked on a quest to locate the resulting rubble. The search led from a golf course in East Potomac Park, where truckloads of soil were being deposited to create a new hole, to an industrial park in Maryland. Despite confirming the dirt at the golf course was from the White House, the journalist was met with secrecy and "no comment" from workers and officials. The article reflects on how a cherished national symbol can be reduced to anonymous debris, trucked away with little public transparency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to end trade negotiations with Canada could lead to higher prices for consumers on goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The halt was reportedly in response to a Canadian TV ad that featured former President Ronald Reagan speaking cautiously about tariffs. The move could keep existing 35% tariffs on many Canadian goods, as well as specific levies on steel and aluminum, in place for an extended period. Since Canada is a top exporter of steel and aluminum to the U.S., prolonged tariffs on these materials would likely increase manufacturing costs that are passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>Independent left-wing candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat. While vote counting is still ongoing, polls have consistently shown strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and lawmaker. As president, she will hold a largely ceremonial role, representing Ireland on the world stage but without direct power over legislation. Connolly, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, will be Ireland's 10th president and the third woman to hold the office.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condos resold between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold for a loss. The median price per square foot for these properties has remained largely flat over the past decade, a stark contrast to the significant price increases seen in most of the country. When factoring in transaction costs, inflation, and renovation expenses, the actual share of unprofitable sales is likely even higher. The luxury market, particularly properties over $10 million, was the main exception, consistently yielding profits for sellers. (not investment advice)</p>
