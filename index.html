          <p>Marissa Coreno, a 27-year-old from Ohio with no family history of cancer, was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer after discovering a lump in her armpit. Medical experts note a rising incidence of breast cancer in women under 50, who often face more aggressive tumors and unique challenges like fertility concerns. After undergoing exhausting chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation, Coreno is now cancer-free and married, sharing her story to urge young people to be vigilant about their health and seek medical advice for any unusual symptoms.</p>

          <p>North Korea is showcasing new missile technology, including what it calls its "most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system," potentially pressuring China to more openly acknowledge its status as a nuclear power. The new missile was revealed shortly before Kim Jong-un's recent visit to Beijing, his first since 2019, where high-ranking Russian and Vietnamese officials were also present for a military parade. Although the new ICBM has not been tested, North Korea successfully tested a new solid-fuel rocket engine last month intended for such weapons, signaling continued advancements in its arsenal.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, the first woman to co-host a nightly news broadcast in the U.S., has passed away at the age of 87, leaving behind a profound legacy at National Public Radio. Colleagues remember her for giving NPR its distinctive, irreverent, and conversational voice, which stood in stark contrast to the formal news anchors of the era. Stamberg championed the art of listening in interviews and believed in covering the full spectrum of human experience, from serious news to moments of levity, to create a program that felt like a companion in listeners' lives.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump publicly suggested that both Ukraine and Russia should cease fighting and declare victory, allowing the conflict to end along current front lines. Zelenskyy confirmed that discussions about the U.S. providing long-range Tomahawk missiles were held but kept private to avoid escalation, despite Trump's earlier openness to a potential trade for Ukrainian drones. The meeting occurred just one day after Trump announced he would soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising questions about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine's war effort.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Illinois officials by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago to protect federal property and personnel. This emergency appeal follows a lower court ruling that blocked such a deployment, with the judge finding no evidence of a "danger of rebellion" as claimed by the administration. The move highlights the ongoing standoff between President Trump and state leaders over federal intervention in cities, a strategy he has already employed in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and Memphis to address crime.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the more than seven-year prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft. In a social media post, Trump stated that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison and would be released immediately. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 following an ethics report, had been serving his sentence since July after being convicted of defrauding donors and voters. The commutation, which is not a pardon, has drawn criticism from some Republicans who believe Santos's crimes warranted a longer punishment.</p>

The data also highlights a significant economic disparity, with the median household wealth of remarried adults being substantially higher than that of divorced individuals who remain single.

While early protests were criticized for their aesthetics, their effectiveness was demonstrated through grassroots organizing that led to electoral victories. The article suggests that embracing sincere, community-based action is the most effective form of opposition in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The NBA has entered into a multiyear partnership with the skin care brand CeraVe, marking the league's first official partner in this category.

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, following sustained pressure over his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a personal statement, the prince said the continued accusations were a distraction from the work of the Royal Family and that he would no longer use his title or conferred honors. This decision, made in consultation with King Charles and Prince William, further diminishes his role after he had already stepped back from public duties. The move comes as a posthumous memoir by his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, is set to be published.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota woman, Samantha Petersen, has been sentenced to four years in prison for a deadly crash with a horse-drawn Amish buggy that killed two children. Authorities stated Petersen was under the influence of methamphetamine when she rear-ended the buggy, then called her identical twin sister, Sarah, to the scene and asked her to claim she was driving. Police uncovered the scheme using location data and a recorded phone call from Petersen to her employer admitting she was not sober and had just killed two people. Her twin sister has already served a sentence for her role in the attempted cover-up.</p>

          <p>Nexperia, a Dutch semiconductor manufacturer, has reportedly halted salary payments and suspended company system access for its employees in China. The move, communicated to customers in a letter from the company's Chinese unit, is seen as the latest escalation in a growing political and tech dispute between the Netherlands and China. Nexperia's Chinese subsidiary expressed deep disappointment, stating it faced "ruthless suppression" from its European management. The company was acquired in 2019 by Chinese electronics firm Wingtech Technology, which confirmed the account blockages and said some access had since been restored.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a company central to 2020 election conspiracy theories, has been acquired by Scott Leiendecker, who is rebranding it as Liberty Vote. The announcement has caused confusion due to conflicting messaging; a public press release leaned into conservative rhetoric about restoring faith in elections, while private communications to county officials assured them of continuity with the "same team, same support, different name." Leiendecker, a former Republican elections director, appears to be attempting a rebrand aimed at winning over conservative jurisdictions, though the strategy risks alienating some officials and may not satisfy dedicated conspiracy theorists.</p>

The situation highlights the personal consequences of the political impasse in Washington, with officers continuing to perform a high-stress job amid growing threats against public officials while facing uncertainty about their own finances.

          <p>High-level delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government are scheduled to meet in Doha for emergency talks following a week of intense border fighting that has killed dozens and injured hundreds. The violence escalated after Pakistan conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, which it claimed were in retaliation for a suicide bombing and targeted militant hideouts. Both countries accuse the other of harboring militants who launch cross-border attacks. The clashes have already had diplomatic consequences, with Afghanistan's cricket board withdrawing from an upcoming series in Pakistan after three local cricketers were reportedly killed in the strikes.</p>

          <p>An editorial in the PLA Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, has condemned nine recently expelled generals for being disloyal and dealing a "serious blow" to the army. The article accused the high-ranking officers of having "a total collapse of their beliefs" and undermining the core principle that the military must be commanded by the Communist Party. While the party has not released specific details, the strong language suggests a significant internal purge aimed at reinforcing political control over the armed forces and rooting out perceived corruption or foreign influence within its ranks.</p>

          <p>The Falls of Clyde, a historic sailing ship built in Scotland in 1878, has been intentionally scuttled off the coast of Hawaii, prompting anger from maritime conservation groups. The ship, which had been a museum in Honolulu since the 1960s, had fallen into disrepair. Despite a decade-long campaign by enthusiasts to bring the vessel back to Scotland for restoration, the Honolulu Harbour Board had it towed into deep water and sunk. Critics have condemned the destruction of a significant piece of maritime heritage, calling it a day that will go down in infamy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that the high cumulative tariffs imposed on Chinese goods are "not sustainable," even as he defended the policy as a necessary response to Beijing's trade practices. The admission comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are set to hold a new round of trade negotiations next week in Malaysia, aiming to de-escalate the economic conflict. The talks follow China's recent expansion of export controls on critical rare-earth minerals, a move that prompted Trump to threaten even more severe tariffs, highlighting the fragile and contentious state of the economic relationship.
