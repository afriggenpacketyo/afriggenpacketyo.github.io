          <p>A recent fatal plane crash involving an Army Black Hawk helicopter at Reagan National Airport has been attributed to the mishandling of a common aviation practice called "visual separation." The crew requested and received permission to navigate around other aircraft visually, rather than relying on air traffic controller guidance. Aviation experts have warned about the risks associated with mishandling visual separation for years, highlighting the potential for deadly outcomes when this practice is not executed correctly. This incident underscores the importance of stringent adherence to safety protocols in aviation.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder new wind energy projects, the aging infrastructure of existing onshore wind farms is creating a "repowering" boom. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from upgrading or replacing older turbines with more efficient models. This repowering activity presents economic benefits, as it avoids the need for new property acquisition and can increase electricity output by up to 50%. The repowering trend is also spurring growth in the turbine recycling industry, contributing to a more sustainable lifecycle for wind energy components.</p>

This development suggests that Trump may be reconsidering his approach to the conflict and may not force Ukraine into a lopsided agreement.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba began a four-day trip to Vietnam and the Philippines to enhance security and economic cooperation amid China's growing influence in the region. Ishiba aims to strengthen security cooperation with the two Southeast Asian nations, highlighting China's "unilateral attempts to change the status quo." The trip also addresses concerns among Japanese companies operating in Vietnam and the Philippines regarding the impact of U.S. tariffs.
