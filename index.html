          <p>U.S. sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson did not advance to the 200-meter final at the national championships, missing the qualifying time by a hundredth of a second. This setback concludes a difficult week for the athlete, who was arrested days prior on a domestic violence charge involving fellow sprinter Christian Coleman. While Richardson holds an automatic bid for the 100-meter race at the upcoming world championships as the defending champion, this loss ends her opportunity to compete in the 200-meter event. The article also notes her past controversies, including a suspension for cannabis use before the 2021 Olympics.</p>

          <p>A group of at least 51 Democratic state legislators has fled Texas to prevent Republicans from achieving the necessary quorum to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed redistricting plan, supported by former President Trump, would significantly favor the GOP and could add up to five Republican seats in the U.S. House. Democrats argue the move is a necessary stand against a "Trump gerrymander" and a "rigged system," while Republicans, including the governor and attorney general, have threatened fines and arrests for lawmakers who break quorum. This action halts progress on other legislative issues, including disaster relief.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing brief shaking felt across the New York City area. While the event startled residents, with some reporting it felt like an impact or explosion, no significant damage or injuries have been reported. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that such minor quakes are not uncommon for the region, though they are infrequent. This event follows a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the same area in April 2024, which was one of the largest on the East Coast in the last century.</p>

          <p>In an interview, economist Jeffrey Sachs stated that ongoing U.S. "sabre-rattling" against China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to war. He characterized the current trade war as a U.S.-initiated conflict and argued that rationality should prevail, as both nations benefit from trade. Sachs predicted that while some form of trade agreement might be reached, frictions will persist due to the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration. He advised that China should focus on expanding its exports to markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. or Europe for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rescue teams in Chile have confirmed the deaths of all five miners who were trapped following a tunnel collapse at the El Teniente copper mine, the world's largest underground copper operation. The bodies were recovered over the weekend after a desperate search effort through the debris. The collapse was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor on Thursday, bringing the total death toll from the incident to six. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, expressed its condolences as authorities announced a criminal investigation into the cause of the fatal collapse.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending a cloud of ash and gas thousands of feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region. Scientists believe the powerful quake may have triggered the volcanic activity by shaking the underground magma system. The area is sparsely populated, and no immediate threat to local communities has been reported, though an aviation alert was issued as a precaution for aircraft traveling through the region.</p>

          <p>A prison riot in Tuxpan, located in the Mexican state of Veracruz, has left seven inmates dead and eleven injured. Authorities reported that order was restored on Sunday after the riot broke out the previous night, during which fires were set within the facility. Some inmates claimed the violence was a rebellion against an extortion scheme run by a criminal organization known as Grupo Sombra, which targeted prisoners and their families. The injured are now receiving medical care, and the fires have been extinguished as an investigation into the incident begins.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, adding over 3 gigawatts last year, a surge driven primarily by large utilities rather than rooftop installations. Analysts attribute the boom to favorable economics, as solar has become a cheaper option than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for projects. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid. The growth highlights a shift where cost-effectiveness, not just environmental policy, is a primary driver for renewable energy expansion.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced new plans to combat illegal immigration by targeting people smugglers who advertise their services on social media. Under the proposed legislation, individuals using online platforms to facilitate illegal crossings of the English Channel could face up to five years in prison. This move aims to give law enforcement more tools to disrupt criminal gangs that promote dangerous journeys. The plan comes as the UK faces increasing pressure to address the record number of migrants arriving in small boats, with an estimated 80% using social media to connect with smugglers.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), announced that applications for a new $50 billion rural hospital fund will be available in early September. This fund is intended to stabilize rural hospitals impacted by healthcare cuts in President Trump's recent legislative package. Dr. Oz also defended changes to Medicaid, including new work requirements, stating that technology will be used to streamline implementation and connect recipients with jobs. He argued the goal is to save the program and help vulnerable populations by promoting work and self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on situational hitting and aggressive baserunning rather than power to break a scoring drought. After being shut out for 18 consecutive innings, the Dodgers manufactured runs through timely singles, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provides some positive momentum for the team's slumping lineup as they head back home.</p>

          <p>A number of former Justice Department attorneys and officials are seeking public office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, who resigned from their career positions, are now running for offices ranging from the U.S. House to state attorney general. They are openly criticizing the administration's policies, such as the dismantling of anti-corruption and civil rights divisions, and are campaigning on a platform of restoring the rule of law. Their candidacies represent a new trend of career public servants entering the political arena in direct response to administration actions.</p>

          <p>Smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning in Canada is drifting across the border, causing hazy skies and poor air quality in several U.S. states, including those in the Midwest and Northeast. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, leading to extended air quality alerts in states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Health officials are advising residents, especially sensitive individuals, to limit outdoor activities due to the pollution. Wind patterns are expected to continue transporting the smoke into the U.S., potentially prolonging the adverse conditions for the coming week.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for consumers who were victims of mis-sold car finance deals involving hidden commissions. Following a Supreme Court ruling that deemed extremely high commissions unfair, the FCA will consult on a plan that could cost the industry between £9bn and £18bn. Payouts are expected to be less than £950 per deal, with the first payments anticipated next year for agreements dating back to 2007. The FCA has advised affected consumers to complain directly to their loan providers rather than using claims management companies.</p>

The Trump administration cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs from a previous government and issues like fentanyl trafficking as justification for the increase.
