            <h2>Trump's Approval Rating on the Economy Drops to Lowest of His Presidential Career, CNBC Survey Finds</h2>

            <p>According to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey, President Donald Trump is registering the worst economic approval numbers of his presidential career amid broad discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation and government spending. The survey found that the boost in economic optimism that accompanied Trump's reelection has disappeared, with more Americans now believing the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023 and with a sharp turn toward pessimism about the stock market. Partisanship is the most significant part of the president's negative showing, he loses some support among Republicans in key areas like tariffs and inflation, and has seen a notable deterioration among independents.</p>

            <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that President Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point during his presidency due to growing dissatisfaction with his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending. The survey reveals a shift towards economic pessimism among Americans, including key demographics like independents and blue-collar workers who were crucial to his election victory. While Trump maintains strong support within his Republican base, concerns over tariffs and inflation are eroding his approval even among some Republicans. The survey highlights a growing belief that the economy will worsen over the next year, reflecting broader unease about the direction of Trump's economic policies.</p>

            <p>Antisemitism in Canada has exploded in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, massacre, reaching record numbers last year and becoming a central issue for the country’s Jewish community ahead of an April 28 federal election. Last week, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, the main challenger to Prime Minister Mark Carney accused pro-Hamas protesters of staging "hate marches" and vowing to deport antisemitic foreigners from Canada. According to an annual audit released this month by B’nai Brith Canada, the total number of reported cases of Jew hatred in the country hit 6,219 in 2024, a 7.4% increase over 2023 and the highest number since the survey’s inception in 1982. Antisemitic incidents in Canada have skyrocketed by 124.6% since 2022.</p>

            <p>Last month the Trump administration proposed the idea of a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire. Ukraine agreed. Russia did not. Or rather, it came up with a long list of conditions. Instead of 30 days, the Kremlin decided on 30 hours. On Saturday, President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine until midnight Sunday night in Moscow. He said he was acting out of "humanitarian" considerations. Such a claim has been met with scepticism in Ukraine more than three years into Russia's war against the country.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, citing humanitarian reasons, but the move has been met with skepticism. Ukraine's President Zelensky reported ongoing attempts by Russian forces to advance despite the announced ceasefire. Russia's defense ministry claimed its troops were adhering to the ceasefire and accused Ukraine of violations. Some observers suggest the truce is a PR move to improve relations with the Trump administration, which has grown impatient with the lack of progress in Ukraine, while others believe it could be a genuine step toward ending the conflict.</p>

            <p>Heather Stewart argues that Labour must focus on the risk to global financial stability posed by Trump's policies, not only trade. While the government negotiates tariffs, Labour's stance on the UK's financial sector appears unchanged, despite warnings from the Bank of England about the dangers of deregulation. The article suggests that Trump's policies could destabilize global finance, especially given high global debt levels and the growth of less-regulated private lending. Labour is encouraged to remember that many are at risk if a crisis hits the hyperglobalised financial system.</p>

The state's unfunded liability for vacation and leave benefits has ballooned to $5.6 billion, raising concerns about the financial burden on taxpayers. Generous time-off provisions and a failure to enforce vacation balance caps contribute to the problem.

This policy is seen as a disturbing democratic backslide, causing emotional hardship for those who fled turmoil in Venezuela.

            <p>Anti-Trump protesters in the US might find inspiration in the Czech Republic's successful ousting of a billionaire leader with autocratic tendencies. The Czech Republic provides a blueprint for how street protests can evolve into a unified electoral strategy. The Million Moments for Democracy movement organized rallies against the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, ultimately leading to his defeat in the 2021 elections. This example suggests that mass protest can lay the groundwork for a successful challenge to authoritarian leaders, but requires unity and a strong message to the political class.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more active role in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda due to its significant mining interests in the region. Beijing has directly called on Kigali to end its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC. This shift from China's usual non-interference policy aims to protect its mining investments and maintain relationships with both countries. Despite the measured approach, China's involvement signals a growing concern over regional stability and its economic interests in Africa.</p>
