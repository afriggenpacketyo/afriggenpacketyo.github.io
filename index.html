          <p>Feras Hamden was arrested after allegedly running Ohio Rep. Max Miller off the road while displaying a Palestinian flag and making threats. Miller, who is Jewish, described the incident as blatant antisemitic violence. The Rocky River Police Department issued a warrant for Hamden's arrest after Miller filed a criminal complaint for aggravated menacing and sought a criminal protection order. The U.S. Capitol Police are also involved in the investigation, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy toward threats against elected officials, as threats against lawmakers have risen in recent years. The suspect is awaiting his first court appearance.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that the Republican's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could lead to higher monthly student loan payments for many borrowers. Under the proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), borrowers could face payments significantly higher than those under the Biden administration's SAVE plan. The RAP plan would also extend the repayment timeline to 30 years, potentially delaying major life milestones for borrowers. Critics argue that the RAP plan could push more borrowers into default due to unaffordable monthly bills. (not investment advice)</p>

Read's defense team suggested that O'Keefe's fatal injuries may have been connected to his dog or a friend at the house party, and they criticized the investigation as sloppy, implying that the real perpetrator is still at large.</p>

The author questions the necessity of such widespread protein consumption, noting that the average American already exceeds the recommended daily intake.

The film critiques the commodification of love but struggles to balance its satirical aims with a compelling narrative.
