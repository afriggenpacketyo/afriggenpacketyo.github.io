          <p>At least 30 people were injured, several critically, when a driver intentionally rammed a car into a crowd outside The Vermont music venue in Los Angeles. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after the driver was reportedly removed from a nearby business. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him, during which he was shot by an unknown individual who then fled the scene. The driver is now in police custody and will face charges for assault with a deadly weapon, while authorities continue to investigate the motive and search for the shooter.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned. While performing her song "Roar" suspended over the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without further incident, later remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song concluded. The event highlights the risks associated with complex stage productions, similar to recent technical difficulties experienced by other major artists during live shows.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested a 52-year-old Mexican national in Chicago who is accused of decapitating a woman and hiding her body. The man, Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, was initially arrested in April on charges including concealing a corpse but was released from custody by a local judge. The case has drawn criticism regarding Illinois' SAFE-T Act, with officials expressing shock that a suspect in such a heinous crime, and who is not a U.S. citizen, was freed. He now remains in ICE custody pending further proceedings.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited the Christian village of Taybeh in the West Bank to show solidarity following an arson attack on the ruins of a historic Byzantine-era church. Local Palestinian residents have blamed Israeli settlers for the fire, which is part of a recent surge in violence in the occupied territory. Huckabee, a staunch supporter of Israel, condemned the desecration of a place of worship and insisted that those responsible for such acts of terror and violence must be prosecuted. His visit underscores the escalating tensions and violence affecting communities in the region.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $20 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit stems from a report alleging Trump signed a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump has vehemently denied and labeled as a "FAKE." The lawsuit, filed in Florida, accuses the newspaper of journalistic failures and making false, unsubstantiated claims. Dow Jones has stated it has full confidence in its reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as "snus," is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, with some using products containing dangerously high levels of nicotine. These pouches are easily accessible to minors as they are currently unregulated by age-restriction laws, leading to concerns about addiction and severe health consequences, including significant gum damage. Health professionals and Trading Standards officers are calling for urgent government action to regulate sales to under-18s through the proposed Tobacco and Vapes Bill.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation has revealed that the initial solar panels installed under the UK's "Great British Energy" initiative were manufactured by Chinese firms, Aiko and Longi. This contradicts the branding of the program, which was promoted as a British-owned company for the British people. The discovery has raised concerns from MPs about the use of taxpayer money to support Chinese supply chains, which have faced allegations of forced labor, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While the companies deny these allegations, the situation highlights the global dominance of Chinese manufacturing in the solar industry and the ethical complexities of green energy procurement.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of drivers at Edinburgh Airport are avoiding the official drop-off zone to circumvent "kiss-and-fly" charges, which have risen to £6 for a ten-minute stay. Instead, they wait in nearby lay-bys and coordinate pick-ups via phone to avoid the fees, which many travelers and taxi drivers describe as "extortionate." This behavior highlights public frustration with rising ancillary charges at UK airports, which stand in contrast to many major European hubs that offer free drop-offs.

          <p>In Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, a systematic campaign is underway to erase Ukrainian national identity and instill pro-Russian ideology in children from a very young age. This effort involves forcing children to participate in militaristic parades, sing Russian patriotic songs, and learn from a revised curriculum that justifies the invasion. Organizations like the Russian defence ministry's "Youth Army" are central to this "brainwashing," which extends to forcibly deporting thousands of children to "re-education camps" in Russia. These actions are considered violations of international humanitarian law and have led to international sanctions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing debate in the UK is examining the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could help prevent learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and address "holiday hunger" for children who rely on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, contend that the long break is essential for recharging and planning, and that spreading holidays differently could create new challenges for booking time off. The discussion reflects varied perspectives on how the school calendar impacts student well-being, family economics, and teacher welfare.</p>

          <p>The increasing global demand for lithium, essential for electric car batteries and other green technologies, is creating a significant environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama Desert. The extraction process involves pumping vast amounts of brine, which depletes scarce water resources, harms local ecosystems, and disrupts the traditional livelihoods of indigenous communities. While mining companies are piloting new, less impactful technologies, locals remain skeptical and fear irreversible damage to their environment, including shrinking lagoons and dying native flora. This situation highlights a critical paradox where the solution to one environmental problem may be exacerbating another.</p>

Experts note that this push faces challenges, including a significant gender gap in investing and the risk of deterring new investors if markets are volatile.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate a key alliance between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to actions by the Mexican government that limited flights at Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral trade agreement and unfairly benefits Mexican carriers. Under the new rules, all Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The dispute could impact the millions of travelers who fly between the two countries and jeopardizes a long-standing airline partnership.</p>

          <p>On the 15th anniversary of his death, the sister of Aamir Siddiqi, a schoolboy murdered in a mistaken-identity attack, has made a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the killing. Aamir, 17, was stabbed to death in his Cardiff home in 2010 by two contract killers who went to the wrong address. While the hitmen are serving life sentences, the suspected mastermind, Mohammed Ali Ege, escaped custody in India in 2011 and remains one of Europe's most wanted men. Aamir's sister urged Ege to hand himself in, telling him he is "not truly free" while living a life on the run.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy's third round at the Open Championship was a mix of spectacular play and strange occurrences, keeping the massive home crowd at Royal Portrush enthralled. After a strong start, his momentum was briefly halted by a bogey on the 11th hole, where his shot from the rough dislodged another ball that had been buried underground. He immediately bounced back with a dramatic 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th, producing one of the loudest roars of the tournament. Despite the rollercoaster round, McIlroy finished with a score of 66, leaving him with an outside chance for a miracle victory on Sunday.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes between the minority Druze community and armed Bedouins have persisted in Syria's Suweida Province, even after the president announced an "immediate ceasefire." The violence, which has reportedly killed over 900 people in the past week, has been marked by accusations of atrocities on both sides and claims that government forces joined in attacks on the Druze. Israel has intervened with military strikes in support of the Druze, and a US-brokered deal was intended to halt the fighting. However, reports of gunfire and looting continued in the city of Suweida after the announcement.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy towards closer cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new security-focused alliance known as the "E3." This shift is highlighted by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, the first of its kind since WWII, and is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have demonstrated this alignment with a joint trip to Kyiv. The alliance aims to bolster European defense, potentially using French and British nuclear deterrence to supplement U.S. protection.</p>

          <p>Reports from Ukraine indicate that men with documented, severe mental health conditions, including personality disorders and schizophrenia, are being drafted into the military. Gaps in medical data systems and perfunctory pre-enlistment physicals allow these individuals to be deemed fit for service, posing a potential danger to themselves and their units. Human rights officials have received thousands of complaints, and some commanders report receiving recruits who are clearly unfit for duty. While authorities state the system complies with the law, advocates and families argue that it fails to account for the realities of these conditions in a combat environment.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing forward Marcus Rashford, who has been an outcast at his current club, Manchester United. A deal in principle has been reached for the 27-year-old England international, who has not played for United since being dropped by the manager last December. The move, likely an initial loan with an option to buy, is a priority for Barcelona as they look to strengthen their attack. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is betting that the talented forward, approaching his peak years, could be a major asset in La Liga and the Champions League.</p>

Although the Wallabies scored two late tries after the Lions made numerous substitutions, the performance gap between the two sides was evident. Pundits noted that while a win is a win, the Lions have more gears to go through and Australia will need to improve significantly to make the series competitive.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Bank of America analysts makes a bold comparison, suggesting that quantum computing could represent the most significant human breakthrough since the discovery of fire. The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, has the theoretical potential to solve endless complex calculations instantly, which could revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, and logistics. While major milestones have been achieved, practical, real-world applications are still hindered by the instability of qubits. The report suggests quantum computing could also turbocharge the development of artificial intelligence, leading to a new era of human knowledge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This week marks the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, led by German army officer Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. The assassination attempt, known as "Operation Valkyrie," failed when the bomb planted by Stauffenberg only minorly injured Hitler, leading to the swift collapse of the planned coup. Stauffenberg and hundreds of co-conspirators were executed, but their actions have become an enduring symbol of German resistance against the Nazi regime. While the conspirators' motives and democratic ideals are debated by historians, their willingness to risk their lives remains a significant historical event.</p>
