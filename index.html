          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was fatally shot Friday during a confrontation with a gunman near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The suspect was later found dead from what authorities believe may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident, which involved the suspect firing rounds at the CDC building, prompted a temporary lockdown and shelter-in-place order, but no civilians were injured. The slain officer, David Rose, was a married father of two with another child on the way.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has prompted evacuation orders for thousands of residents in Southern California after igniting on Thursday. The blaze, located near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, grew from 30 acres to nearly 5,400 acres in about a day, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions. While firefighters have achieved partial containment and one firefighter was injured when their truck overturned, the fire remains active. Authorities are urging residents to remain vigilant as high temperatures are expected to continue, complicating control efforts.</p>

Both veteran aces delivered strong performances, with Kershaw pitching six innings and allowing only one run. The game remained a tight duel until the fifth inning, when a two-run homer by Mookie Betts gave the Dodgers a lead they would not relinquish. The game showcased the enduring talent of two of baseball's most decorated pitchers in a contest between first-place teams.</p>

          <p>A year after a catastrophic landslide at a Kampala landfill killed 34 people and left over 200 homeless, residents of the Kiteezi suburb continue to live in fear and financial hardship. The disaster, triggered by a methane explosion, buried more than 70 homes, and many victims are still awaiting promised government compensation. While the Kiteezi landfill is now officially closed, with Japanese aid helping to secure the site, controversy surrounds the new dumpsite in a protected forest reserve. The city faces an ongoing challenge in managing its 2,000 daily tons of waste amid legal battles.</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent decision to sanction an Indian refinery for processing and exporting products from Russian crude is not expected to disrupt ongoing EU-India free trade talks. The sanctions, part of the EU's 18th package against Russia, target Nayara Energy, which is partially owned by Russian energy giant Rosneft. However, experts believe the measure is largely symbolic and will have a minimal impact on India's economy. Paradoxically, the threat of more significant US tariffs on Indian goods may actually increase India's motivation to finalize a trade agreement with the EU for economic stability.</p>

          <p>A UK government reform restricting its summer internship program to applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds has divided students aspiring to a civil service career. The policy aims to make the civil service more representative of society, a move praised by some students who now feel they have a fairer chance. However, others from working-class families whose parents' jobs fall just outside the new criteria feel unfairly excluded and discouraged from public service. The debate highlights the complexities of defining social mobility and the personal impact of such policy changes on young people's career plans.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough detailed in the journal Nature. This rare diamond structure, first discovered in an Arizona meteorite in 1967, is distinct from the common cubic diamond due to its atomic arrangement. Previous attempts by global research teams to synthesize this material typically resulted in mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's achievement in producing pure hexagonal diamond crystals of a macroscopic size provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens new possibilities for its study and application.</p>

The flat CPI reading was slightly better than market forecasts of a minor decline and followed a 0.1% rise in June. A senior statistician attributed a month-over-month price increase to government policies aimed at boosting domestic demand. However, the overall data, including falling food prices and ongoing factory-gate deflation, suggests that economic pressures and trade turbulence continue to weigh on growth.

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is gaining momentum as people spend on small luxuries and larger experiences to boost their morale amid economic uncertainty. This behavior, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," sees consumers cutting back on daily essentials while splurging on items from makeup and home goods to expensive concert tickets. Economists note that this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional life milestones like home ownership for many. As a result, consumers are injecting moments of guilt-free joy into their lives to cope with persistent inflation and a volatile global outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines was forced to implement a nationwide ground stop for all its mainline flights due to a technical problem with its weight and balance computer system. The issue, which occurred Wednesday evening, caused significant delays and left many passengers stranded on tarmacs across the country. While flights already in the air were unaffected, the airline held departing flights at their airports for several hours until the technology issue was resolved. The company apologized for the inconvenience and stated its teams were working to restore normal operations and assist affected customers.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the retailer overcharged customers in California.

As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and implement measures to ensure accurate pricing and weighing in its California stores. The company did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to the terms to resolve the matter.</p>

          <p>A Fremont man has been federally charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, valued at over $200,000, from a UCLA library in a scheme involving fake identities and dummy books. The suspect, Jeffrey Ying, allegedly used multiple aliases to check out valuable manuscripts, some dating to the 13th century, and replaced them with low-value or blank books. According to an FBI affidavit, Ying abused a library system that did not require official ID for rentals and was arrested before an alleged attempt to flee to China. The investigation suggests a pattern of thefts that may have spanned several years.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano, Lucasfilm, and parent company Disney have settled a lawsuit in which Carano claimed she was wrongfully fired from "The Mandalorian" over her social media posts. While settlement details are private, Lucasfilm issued a statement praising Carano's professionalism and expressing hope for future work opportunities. Carano was dismissed in 2021 after a series of controversial posts, including one that appeared to compare the political climate for conservatives to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. This article argues that her firing was an overreaction and that the settlement was the appropriate resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to BTIG's chief market technician, Jonathan Krinsky, the stock market has broken through a key technical level that suggests a 5% sell-off is imminent. He predicts the S&P 500 could fall back to the 6,100 level, which previously acted as a price ceiling, before presenting a new buying opportunity. Krinsky cites four warning signs for this potential correction: weakness in consumer-focused stocks, a historical tendency for semiconductors to underperform in late summer, the potential for credit spreads to widen, and signs of profit-taking in mega-cap tech stocks despite strong earnings.

          <p>The Ford Transit, an iconic vehicle that became a staple for tradespeople, rock bands, and even bank robbers, is celebrating its 60th anniversary. First rolling off the production line on August 9, 1965, the Transit was revolutionary for its space, power, and comfort, transforming the commercial van market. Over 13 million units have been built, and though UK production ceased in 2013, its design and engineering heritage remains in the country. As the brand moves toward an electric and software-defined future, it faces a more competitive market where brand loyalty is no longer as strong as it once was.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has seen a notable increase in complaints about models appearing "unhealthily thin" in advertisements, leading to recent bans of ads from major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S. While the number of complaints is still relatively small, the trend has sparked concern among industry experts and activists about a potential return to the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. The ASA's rulings have focused on how posing, lighting, and styling can make models appear thinner than they are. The debate highlights ongoing societal tensions around body image and representation in fashion.</p>
