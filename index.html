          <p>The gunman who killed four people in Midtown Manhattan, Shane Tamura, was found to have low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to New York's Chief Medical Examiner. Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the brain disease and asked for his brain to be studied, believing the NFL knowingly concealed its dangers. While experts caution that a CTE diagnosis does not explain complex behaviors like a mass shooting, the finding adds to the ongoing conversation about the long-term effects of head injuries in contact sports. The article provides context on CTE, its symptoms, and its prevalence among former football players.</p>

          <p>Former bond trader Howard Rubin and his ex-assistant were arrested on charges of sex trafficking, accused of transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges Rubin operated a so-called "sex dungeon" in a Manhattan penthouse where he brutalized women, often beyond their consent, causing physical injuries. This federal criminal case follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking six women and ordered to pay damages. Rubin previously gained notoriety for unauthorized trades detailed in the book "Liar's Poker."</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old from Texas, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for murdering his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she slept. Immediately after the incident, Elliott called 911 claiming he thought he was dreaming and has since maintained that he was sleepwalking, a defense supported by a family history of the condition. Prosecutors are proceeding with murder charges despite finding no evidence of animosity between the twins, who were described as exceptionally close. The case hinges on the rare and complex legal defense of parasomnia, where an individual commits a violent act while unconscious during sleep.</p>

The demonstration was organized in opposition to the transfer of ICE detainees to out-of-state facilities and follows a recent shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas. Protesters were seen attempting to block vehicles, leading to a tense standoff and two arrests, with one individual reportedly carrying a firearm. The facility is a central hub for "Operation Midway Blitz," a DHS initiative targeting undocumented immigrants in sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

          <h2>Analyzing the Monthly Cost of a $150,000 Home Equity Loan After Fed Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 13:43:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly payments on a new $150,000 home equity loan have decreased slightly. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.34% would cost approximately $1,847 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be around $1,452 per month. These figures represent a modest saving compared to rates from earlier in the year, translating to potential savings of over $1,900 over a decade. With more rate cuts potentially on the horizon, homeowners may find borrowing against their equity an increasingly attractive option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat expectations, but investors reacted negatively to certain details, causing the stock to fall over 2%. Key concerns included same-store sales growth of 5.7%, which missed estimates of 5.9%, and a slight decline in membership renewal rates. Despite these issues, analysts noted strong points such as a 14% growth in membership fee income and an increase in online signups from a younger demographic. Most Wall Street firms maintained a positive long-term outlook on the company, though many slightly lowered their price targets. (not investment advice)</p>

These fossils, discovered in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois on the island of Java, were the first known evidence of Homo erectus, a key ancestor of modern humans. The decision follows a recommendation from a committee which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population during the Dutch colonial era. This act of repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to reckon with its colonial past and return culturally significant artifacts to their countries of origin.</p>

The bribery came to light after Gill's phone was examined at Manchester Airport under counter-terrorism laws, revealing WhatsApp messages detailing the arrangement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 50% tariff imposed by the U.S. on Brazilian coffee has caused exports to plummet, with sales to the U.S. falling 46% in August compared to the previous year. According to Cecafe, Brazil's coffee exporter group, this trend is expected to continue if the tariffs remain, further disrupting the global market for the world's largest coffee producer. While other countries like Colombia have increased their purchases of Brazilian coffee, industry leaders state that the U.S. market is too large to be fully replaced. The tariffs have pushed global coffee prices higher, benefiting some producers but hurting exporters, roasters, and consumers.</p>

          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has barred the pro-Russia party Heart of Moldova from participating in this weekend's parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities amid an ongoing investigation into illegal party financing and voter bribery, allegedly funded by Russia to sway the election's outcome. The election is a critical moment for Moldova, an EU candidate country, as the ruling pro-European party faces a challenge from a bloc of Russia-friendly parties. The party has denied the allegations, calling the move a politically orchestrated attack to silence them.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" program, offering U.S. residency in exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the government, a sharp price cut from the initially proposed $5 million. Immigration attorneys report a surge in demand from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India, as the price is now competitive with or cheaper than similar "golden visa" programs in other countries. Despite the interest, the program faces potential legal challenges as it was created via executive order, and logistical hurdles remain as there is not yet a formal application process.</p>

The zoo stated that the new arrivals are welcome additions to the troop, which is structured to mirror the social dynamics of chimpanzees in the wild.</p>

          <p>During a defiant speech at the UN General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the recent recognition of a Palestinian state by several Western nations, calling it a "mark of shame" that rewards terrorism. As he began his address, dozens of diplomats and officials from multiple countries staged a walkout, leaving large sections of the hall empty. Netanyahu rejected UN findings that Israel has committed genocide and is restricting aid in Gaza, and vowed that Israel would not allow a Palestinian state to exist.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has shifted his political focus to immigration, making it a central issue in his government's agenda. This strategic pivot, which includes the announcement of a new digital ID system, is widely seen as a direct response to the rising popularity of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, which now leads in some opinion polls. In a recent speech, Starmer framed the political landscape as a choice between his party's "patriotic national renewal" and Reform's "politics of predatory grievance." The move signals Labour's intent to compete directly with Reform on an issue that has become a major concern for voters.</p>
