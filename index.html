          <p>Karen Read awaits her fate in a Massachusetts courthouse, accused of the murder of her Boston cop boyfriend in a suspected drunken hit-and-run. Jurors deliberated for just under two hours on Friday and returned Monday for a full day, leading to speculation about the verdict's timing. The article draws parallels to other high-profile murder cases, such as OJ Simpson, Casey Anthony, Scott Peterson and Alex Murdaugh, noting the wide range in deliberation times and outcomes. A New York City defense attorney suggests that longer deliberations could favor Read. </p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made little progress in bridging gaps over tariffs at their summit, casting doubt on a quick, mutually beneficial deal. Ishiba emphasized that any deal should serve the interests of both countries and that ministerial talks will continue. The United States has granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but it is uncertain whether this will be extended. Japan is urging the U.S. to reconsider the tariff policy, particularly the 25% tariff on autos, which is a critical sector for the Japanese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Current law states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions, with approval from two doctors. One amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals or violent partners who cause a pregnancy to end unlawfully. Recent data indicates a rise in investigations related to suspected abortion offenses. </p>

          <p>Homelessness in America is increasing, particularly among those 55 and older, with over 140,000 older Americans experiencing homelessness on any given day. This number is expected to nearly triple by 2030, often due to factors like the death of a spouse, job loss, or medical issues. Those providing services express concern for this vulnerable population, who often face complex health conditions. The trend has been ongoing for 30 years, with the Baby Boomer generation being particularly affected due to high unemployment and rising housing costs in their early adulthood. </p>

Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) is urging the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the marketing and sale of nicotine pouches to under 18s. Nicotine pouches are considered less harmful than smoking but are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers. </p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasing its focus on arms exports, driven by security concerns rather than profit. The shift aims to deepen ties and interoperability with allies, particularly in security fields. Developing its defense industrial base is another key motivation, enabling economies of scale to make domestic production more viable. While Japan's arms exports are currently low compared to other nations, building domestic capacity is seen as essential for ensuring its security and reducing dependence on the U.S. </p>
