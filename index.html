          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, is currently on trial in Arizona for conspiring to murder her fourth husband. Daybell maintains that her brother acted in self-defense when he shot her husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, while prosecutors argue it was a premeditated plot to obtain a $1 million life insurance policy and marry Chad Daybell. During her closing argument, Daybell told jurors the shooting was a "tragic family event" and urged them to watch her entire police interview, while the prosecution argued that evidence showed the shooting was an "execution" and the scene was "staged." The jury is currently deliberating the verdict.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels imported from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, following a trade case brought by American manufacturers. These manufacturers allege that their Southeast Asian competitors are flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods. The Commerce Department calculated dumping duties ranging from 6.1% to 271.28% and countervailing duties between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country.

          <p>As Canada approaches its federal election, climate change concerns have taken a backseat to issues such as rising prices, energy costs, and housing affordability, with the threat posed by US President Donald Trump topping Canada's federal election agenda. Liberal leader Mark Carney is advocating for Canada to become a global superpower in both conventional and green energy, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre aims to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. This marks a significant shift from the 2021 election, where the environment was a top voter concern. The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's natural resources.</p>

          <p>A federal court in Denver heard arguments in a case challenging the Trump administration's deportation policies under the Alien Enemies Act, with immigrant rights groups arguing that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is insufficient. The ACLU of Colorado contends that this short notice violates due process rights, particularly for those detained at the Aurora ICE Processing Center. The case has triggered emergency filings after the Supreme Court intervened, raising concerns about the legal rights of migrants facing deportation. The ACLU argues that if the government can remove individuals without due process, it erodes civil liberties for everyone.</p>

          <p>Approximately 5 million Americans with defaulted student loans will face mandatory collections starting May 5, marking the end of pandemic-era relief measures. This announcement coincides with significant staff reductions at the Department of Education, raising concerns about the resources available to assist borrowers. While the administration emphasizes protecting taxpayers from the cost of defaulted loans, critics argue that these collections will harm working families and exacerbate economic chaos. The administration is working to rehome the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to other agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, which could lead to further disruptions for borrowers.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzed the potential harm of the Trump administration's trade policies toward China on tech giants like Nvidia and Apple. He noted that the current policy of "scorched earth without military confrontation" is negatively impacting these companies, with investors wary of betting on firms where the government is seemingly mandating weaker numbers. Cramer highlighted that Nvidia is perceived to not be doing enough to prevent China from accessing its products, while Apple is caught in the crosshairs of the trade war due to its manufacturing and sales in China. Cramer believes that a strong Apple with business in China is in the nation's best interest. (not investment advice)</p>
