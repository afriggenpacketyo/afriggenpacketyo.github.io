          <p>Hamas has provided a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal, signaling readiness for immediate negotiations. The plan, backed by the U.S., reportedly includes a 60-day truce, a phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. While Israel has reportedly accepted the conditions, Hamas's key demand remains a guarantee that Israeli military operations will not resume after the ceasefire. The development comes amid ongoing Israeli strikes across Gaza and international calls to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>The tech IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged slump, with crypto company Circle's stock surging sixfold since its June debut. This performance, along with other recent IPOs and the upcoming Figma offering, has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms. While VCs are "cautiously optimistic," the recovery is not yet considered a sustained trend, as many large private companies remain on the sidelines. The industry hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts and loosened regulations to further entice companies to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dutch and German intelligence services report that Russia is increasingly and systematically using prohibited chemical weapons, including the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin, in Ukraine. The weapons are allegedly used to force Ukrainian soldiers out of trenches, making them vulnerable to conventional attack. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans has called for more sanctions, stating the use of such weapons has become "standardized and commonplace" for Russian forces. Russia has previously denied these accusations, which have also been noted by the U.S. State Department.</p>

          <p>A new spending bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security, contrary to some claims, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction. The legislation provides a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals over 65 with incomes below $75,000, which is set to expire in 2028. Policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. Critics also suggest the measure could worsen Social Security's long-term financial stability by reducing revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Turkey's LGBTQ+ community is facing escalating government repression, including bans on Pride events and the blocking of community-focused news portals. Despite this, activists are persevering under the slogan "Insisting on life," highlighting their resilience against intimidation and attempts to erase their existence. Observers note a rise in hostile rhetoric from government officials, who portray the community as a threat to family values. This political climate has contributed to a dangerous atmosphere, overshadowing critical issues like poverty, violence, and lack of access to healthcare within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has publicly denied allegations of abuse from Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was mistakenly deported from the U.S. and held in a notorious supermax prison. Abrego Garcia claimed in a U.S. legal filing that he endured "severe beatings" and "psychological torture" at the CECOT prison. In response, President Bukele posted photos and videos on social media, questioning why Abrego Garcia looked well if he had been starved and tortured. The case has drawn attention to the harsh conditions in El Salvador's prisons under its widespread crackdown on gangs.</p>

          <p>An extraordinary century from Jamie Smith, who scored 184 not out, led a remarkable England fightback on the third day of the second Test against India. Smith, along with Harry Brook who scored 158, put on a massive 303-run partnership after England had collapsed to 85-5. However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj, stormed back with the second new ball, causing a late collapse as England's final five wickets fell for just 20 runs. Despite England's heroics, India holds a commanding overall lead of 244 runs with nine wickets in hand.</p>

Building collapses are a recurring issue in Pakistan, where lax construction laws and poor oversight often lead to such tragedies.

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for one in ten new car sales in the United Kingdom during June, marking a significant increase in market share. Brands like BYD, MG, and Omoda have seen rapid growth, with Chinese-made cars making up over 8% of sales in the first half of the year. This surge comes as other Western countries, including the U.S. and Canada, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The UK has not followed suit, creating a major opportunity for Chinese manufacturers in a market increasingly shifting toward electric cars. (not investment advice)</p>

Hamilton, who is seeking a record-extending tenth win at his home race, noted that Ferrari's pace was positive, especially since rivals McLaren and Red Bull introduced upgrades.</p>

          <p>Left-wing MP Zarah Sultana has announced her departure from the Labour Party with the intention of launching a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn welcomed her decision, he indicated that discussions about a new party were still in the early stages, suggesting Sultana's announcement may have been premature. The potential new party aims to capture a space to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour, with polling suggesting it could attract up to 10% of the vote. This development reflects the ongoing fragmentation and volatility in UK politics.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary injunction. The proscription means that membership or public support for the group will become a criminal offense, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group, known for targeting companies linked to Israel's arms industry, following an action that caused an estimated £7 million in damages.

While some soldiers report supportive reactions from comrades, others have faced threats and harassment, with little legal recourse. Despite these challenges, there is growing public support in Ukraine for LGBTQ+ rights, and activists hope for legislative progress.</p>
