          <p>Apple, previously considered a safe haven in the tech market, is now underperforming compared to its sector, raising questions about the tech sector's overall stability. While tech stocks have generally rebounded from tariff-induced selloffs, Apple has struggled, trading below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Investors are broadly betting on the U.S. stock market, which inherently includes tech, rather than solely focusing on the tech sector, with ETFs like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF seeing significant inflows. Experts suggest investors are diversifying with traditional defensive sectors amidst market volatility, indicating a shift in how tech is perceived. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remains in hiding during a joint military campaign against Iran, officials are reportedly discussing potential successors. Mojtaba Khamenei, the ayatollahâ€™s son, and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of Ruhollah Khomeini, are considered frontrunners. Mojtaba Khamenei, sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, is a hardliner aligned with his father, while Hassan Khomeini is seen as a reformist. The final decision rests with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is currently relaying orders through a trusted aide due to assassination concerns, making the selection process highly sensitive.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating the theft of an 18th-century violin, valued at over Â£150,000, from The Marquess Tavern in Islington. The violin belonged to a member of London's Philharmonia Orchestra and was reportedly stolen on the evening of February 18th. Authorities are appealing to the public for assistance in locating the suspects and recovering the instrument. The violin, made in Florence in 1740, is considered "priceless" to its owner, making its recovery a high priority for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The proportion of children in Germany growing up in large families (three or more children) has increased in recent years, largely due to immigration since 2015. Families with a migration background are almost twice as likely to have three or more children compared to families without foreign roots. In 2024, 19% of migrant families had at least three children, compared to around 10% of other families. Larger families are slightly more common in western federal states than in eastern Germany, reflecting demographic shifts within the country.</p>

Ford will notify owners, and dealerships will update the vehicle's software to fix the problem, with the remedy expected to be available by late September.

Hill suggests Iran may seek a "sweet spot" response, doing enough to satisfy domestic demands without provoking further U.S. attacks. He believes Iran is unlikely to engage in extreme actions that would directly target American forces and citizens, as that would almost certainly force a retaliation from the American side. Instead, Iran is more likely to carry out demonstrative attacks against Israel, while avoiding complete capitulation.</p>

Experts recommend focusing on key priorities and communicating honestly with vendors to manage costs effectively. They suggest finding a "north star" by aligning on two or three priorities and budgeting for those first, and also recommend considering off-season dates or trimming the guest list to reduce expenses. Engaging vendors' expertise and asking for cash gifts can also help couples stay within their financial limits.</p>

          <p>The United States joined an Israeli-led offensive, bombing Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow. President Trump claimed a "spectacular military success," but the extent of the damage and Iran's ability to retaliate remain unclear. The attack was prompted by a perception that Iran had become vulnerable, with obstacles to war previously posed by Hamas, Hezbollah, and Syria having diminished. The US and Iran have a long history of mutual distrust and hatred, making it easy to imagine scenarios in which the strikes escalate into something much bigger.</p>

          <p>Researchers have observed orcas in the North Pacific using kelp to "massage" each other, selecting pieces of seaweed and rubbing them between their bodies. Drones were used to film the animals, which appears to be an example of tool use in killer whales, fashioning a tubular piece of seaweed and using it for a specific, planned purpose. Scientists believe this behavior, dubbed "allokelping", might have a health or hygiene function, and also be a form of social bonding. This marine version of allogrooming in primates highlights the importance of physical touch in maintaining social relationships among these social animals.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Paola Clouatre, the wife of Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre, leading to family separation and uncertainty. Paola, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. as a child seeking asylum, was detained despite being married to a veteran and seeking a green card. The case highlights stricter immigration enforcement policies and reduced discretion for military families. Advocates argue that the administration's actions contradict the Marine Corps' recruitment efforts, which often promote enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status.</p>
