            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has firmly rejected U.S. President Trump's threat to escalate tariffs on Chinese goods by an additional 50%. The ministry stated that such a move is a "mistake on top of a mistake" and vowed to take necessary countermeasures to protect its own interests. The statement emphasized that China will not accept coercion and will defend its rights to the end if the U.S. insists on escalating the trade dispute. This escalation in trade tensions between the two economic powerhouses raises concerns about the potential impact on global markets and supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will engage in direct, high-level talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program, commencing on Saturday. Trump expressed hope that a deal could be reached, similar to the one with Libya, emphasizing that diplomacy is preferable to the alternative. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, present during the announcement, affirmed his alignment with Trump in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Trump also reiterated his vision of relocating Palestinians from Gaza to create a "freedom zone," a proposal that has faced international rejection.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can continue using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, but with certain limitations. The court stipulated that any challenges to the use of the wartime law must occur in Texas, where the migrants are detained, and not in Washington D.C. While siding with the administration, the court emphasized that judicial review is required and detainees must receive notice and an opportunity to seek habeas relief before deportation. The ruling sparked dissent among liberal justices, who argued that the administration's actions posed a threat to the rule of law.</p>
