          <p>A European court ruled that the European Commission should have released text messages between its president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Pfizer's CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The New York Times sought the messages, arguing they were public records under EU transparency laws. The court rejected the commission's argument that text messages are short-lived and lack important information, ordering a more detailed explanation for withholding the documents. The ruling is viewed as a victory for transparency and accountability within the European Union, particularly concerning negotiations that involve public funds and shape public policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is fast-tracking a deal for a copper mine on Oak Flat, a sacred site for the Western Apache, leading to legal battles and protests. The proposed land swap would allow a foreign-owned mining company to destroy most of Oak Flat, leaving behind a massive sinkhole. Apache Stronghold, a nonprofit, won a temporary injunction blocking the land swap, pending Supreme Court consideration.

Despite having Messi, Luis SuÃ¡rez, Jordi Alba, and Sergio Busquets, Inter Miami has failed to win major trophies. Tactical adjustments and potential summer transfers are expected to address these issues, but the pressure is on to perform in upcoming competitions.</p>
