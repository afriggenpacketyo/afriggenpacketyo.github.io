            <p>Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City, has been indicted on federal charges including murder with a firearm and stalking. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Mangione, who is also facing state murder charges. The indictment alleges Mangione traveled across state lines to stalk and kill Thompson, who was fatally shot outside a Manhattan hotel where he was scheduled to attend an investor meeting. Authorities believe Mangione meticulously planned the slaying, though a motive remains unclear.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security cited the op-ed and her alleged involvement in associations that undermine U.S. foreign policy as reasons for the visa revocation.

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly considering plans to end most of its routine food safety inspections, effectively outsourcing this oversight to state and local authorities. The move could free up FDA resources for higher-priority and foreign inspections, though the plans are not yet finalized and may require congressional action. Some argue that states can conduct inspections at a lower cost while maintaining the same standards. However, consumer advocates caution that a transition would require significant time and resources to ensure food safety is not compromised.</p>

            <p>Three congressmen are raising concerns about data privacy following 23andMe's bankruptcy filing, questioning the fate of the company's genetic database. They have sent a letter to 23andMe requesting information on how the company will protect the data in the event of a sale and how it will vet potential buyers. The bankruptcy filing has raised fears that sensitive genetic information could fall into the wrong hands, prompting calls for customers to delete their data.</p>

            <p>Google lost a major antitrust case, with a federal judge ruling that the company illegally maintained a monopoly in the online advertising market. The Justice Department is calling for Google to be broken up, a move that could have significant implications for Big Tech. While breaking up big companies is challenging, the ruling highlights growing concerns about the power and influence of tech giants. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for future antitrust enforcement.</p>

            <p>President Trump called the shooting at Florida State University "terrible" but indicated he is unlikely to support new gun control measures. He emphasized his support for the Second Amendment, stating that "the gun doesn't do the shooting, the people do." Trump's stance comes despite calls for stricter gun laws following the shooting, which resulted in two deaths and six injuries. Trump signed an executive order in early February ordering Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into rolling back several Biden-era gun regulations, including stricter rules for firearms dealers.</p>
