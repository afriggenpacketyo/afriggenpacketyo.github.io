          <p>Tesla refuted a Wall Street Journal report stating that its board was seeking a replacement for CEO Elon Musk, causing the company's shares to fluctuate. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm dismissed the report as "absolutely false" via social media, affirming the board's confidence in Musk's leadership and his ability to execute the company's growth strategy. This denial comes after Tesla experienced a drop in sales and profits in the first quarter, with Musk acknowledging that his involvement with the Trump administration might be affecting the automaker's stock price. Musk plans to dedicate a limited amount of time each week to the Department of Government Efficiency starting in May.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mounjaro's revenue reached $3.84 billion, up 113%, while Zepbound generated $2.31 billion in sales, quadrupling its previous year's figures. However, the pharmaceutical company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. Despite maintaining its sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion, Eli Lilly's CEO Dave Ricks discussed the potential impact of President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals and the company's investments in U.S. manufacturing.</p>

          <p>With millions of American households burdened by credit card debt, experts recommend several steps to avoid defaulting. These include contacting the credit card issuer to explore options like temporary payment pauses or extended timelines, ceasing further use of the card to prevent additional debt, and creating a personal budget to ensure timely payments. Credit counseling from non-profit agencies can also provide specialized debt management plans, while a debt consolidation loan may offer lower interest rates. The key is proactive communication and commitment to a repayment strategy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Experts weigh in on whether it's easier to qualify for a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) or a home equity loan, noting that HELOCs may be easier due to their interest rates being based on the prime rate plus a margin. Some HELOC lenders also offer more flexibility with debt-to-income ratios, especially for borrowers with high credit scores and significant home equity. Ultimately, the best option depends on individual needs and financial goals, with HELOCs offering flexibility and home equity loans providing fixed terms (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed a deal granting Washington access to Ukraine's natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals, establishing an investment fund to aid Ukraine's reconstruction efforts after the war with Russia. The agreement doesn't require Ukraine to repay any supposed "debt" and includes provisions for new oil and gas projects. The US Treasury Department used a harsher tone towards Russia in announcing the deal. The agreement acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU, ensuring that the deal doesn't conflict with that goal.</p>

          <p>Experts are discussing the impact of the spring heatwave on UK plants, with temperatures expected to reach 29C. Indoor plants may suffer from increased temperatures and direct sunlight, requiring protection and shading. Outdoor plants will need more water, especially newly planted ones, while fruit and vegetables may ripen faster. Trees could face challenges due to the warmer weather coupled with existing soil moisture deficits. Gardeners are advised to water in the morning or evening to minimize evaporation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that his tariffs could result in fewer and costlier products in the United States, suggesting that children might "have two dolls instead of 30 dolls". He insisted that China would suffer more from his trade war, despite a new government report showing the U.S. economy shrank during the first three months of the year. Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any setbacks and claimed that tariffs would encourage companies to move production to the USA. Democrats argue that Trump's policies could lead to a recession.</p>

          <p>As pronatalist policies gain traction, it's worth considering whether they truly benefit children, beyond societal needs. Government financial support for parents, such as a baby bonus, could positively impact families' financial stability and children's well-being. However, the value of more children in society is complex, with some arguing it could foster greater tolerance and child-friendly environments, while others caution about potential patriarchal values and resource allocation. Ultimately, prioritizing children's needs, such as food, housing, healthcare, and education, is essential for their well-being.</p>
