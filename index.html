          <h2>Trump Administration Accused of Eroding Ethical Boundaries</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A news analysis by the New York Times details how the second Trump administration is allegedly disregarding ethical norms and legal guardrails, citing examples such as accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar for official use and later transferring it to Trump's presidential foundation. The article claims that this action follows a pattern of leveraging the presidential position for personal benefit, including profiting from a meme cryptocurrency, pressuring law firms for donations, and securing lucrative deals with tech and media companies. The analysis contrasts this with past instances of questionable conduct by politicians from both parties, emphasizing the openness and scale of the current administration's actions, while also pointing out the Supreme Court's ruling granting immunity to presidents for their official actions, and the suspension of enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The article suggests a growing normalization of conflicts of interest and a disregard for traditional standards of public service.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former critic, for New Jersey governor, praising him as an "America First Candidate." Ciattarelli responded with gratitude and emphasized uniting the party to make New Jersey affordable and safe again. This endorsement marks a turnaround, as Ciattarelli previously criticized Trump. The endorsement has sparked reactions, with Bill Spadea, another Republican candidate, criticizing Ciattarelli's record, and the New Jersey Democratic Governors Association blasting the endorsement and claiming Ciattarelli would put Trump before New Jersey. The endorsement sets the stage for a competitive Republican primary.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has put India in a difficult position, as India has historically opposed third-party mediation, especially regarding Kashmir. The offer came after a ceasefire brokered by the US following cross-border clashes. India views Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and insists on bilateral negotiations, while Pakistan has historically been open to mediation. The main opposition Congress party in India has requested an explanation from the government, expressing concern about the potential for internationalizing the Kashmir dispute. The article highlights the complexities of the situation and the long-standing tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meme coin contest, offering tickets to an exclusive dinner gala, concluded with the top 220 holders winning invitations, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to the inclusion of wallets linked to possible foreign individuals and entities. The top coin holder's wallet is allegedly owned by a foreign crypto exchange advised by a Chinese billionaire, Justin Sun, who has ties to other Trump family crypto ventures. The second top holder is a Singaporean entity. The coin's price has fluctuated significantly, resulting in both massive profits for some and losses for many investors, with hundreds of thousands of investors reportedly losing money on Trump meme coin investments. The website now includes a disclaimer saying the tour is being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself is appearing as a guest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York proved to be underwhelming, signaling a potential slowdown in the art market. Economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs was cited as a contributing factor. While the sale totaled $272 million, it fell short of pre-sale expectations, with many items presold and lacking enthusiastic bidding. A Mondrian painting, the top lot, sold for $47.6 million, less than the previous record for a Mondrian. However, paintings by Gerhard Richter, Vincent van Gogh, and Helen Frankenthaler sold above their high estimates, indicating some demand in the art market.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed significant restrictions on the federal food stamp program (SNAP), aiming to limit funding and benefits as part of a larger effort to advance President Trumpâ€™s tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding and impose stricter work requirements for beneficiaries, potentially impacting millions of low-income families. Republicans argue that these changes will improve program efficiency and control costs, while critics contend that they will deepen hunger and poverty. The plan faces opposition from Democrats and anti-poverty groups, who advocate for more generous federal nutrition aid.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic led to significant flight delays, with some flights delayed by up to seven hours. The FAA attributed the delays to staffing issues, while others familiar with the situation claimed that the number of fully certified controllers on duty was at times critically low. The delays are the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark Airport, including recent radar outages caused by software and hardware problems. The Transportation Secretary has announced plans to reduce flights at the airport and implement infrastructure upgrades to address the issues.</p>

          <p>A Democratic National Committee (DNC) panel has recommended redoing David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta's elections as party vice-chairs due to alleged violations of the party's charter. The resolution stems from a challenge by Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg and claims the DNC improperly combined questions and tallied votes, disadvantaging female candidates. The controversy is separate from Hogg's efforts to primary some Democratic politicians, which have drawn criticism from within the party. DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed disappointment over the procedural error and stated his expectation for a fair resolution.</p>
