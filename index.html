          <h2>Study projects significant declines in global food production due to climate change.</h2>

          <p>A new study in *Nature* warns that global food production, particularly of staple crops like maize and soy, is set to decline significantly by the end of the century due to climate change, even with adaptation efforts. The largest drops are expected in major food-producing regions like the US Midwest, while cooler countries such as Russia and Canada may see increases. This shift could lead to higher food prices and increased food insecurity, despite potential benefits for rice yields in South and Southeast Asia. For every degree Celsius of warming, global food production is projected to decline by 120 calories per person per day, highlighting the urgent need to address climate change's impact on agriculture.</p>

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the decision invites legislatures to engage in discrimination and will authorize untold harm to transgender children and their families.

          <p>The youth-led Sunrise Movement is launching a new campaign, "End the Oligarchy, Save Our Futures," aimed at holding big oil companies accountable for climate damage and pushing for climate action. The campaign seeks to reframe climate action as a populist issue and will focus on passing "climate superfund" bills in statehouses across the country, requiring fossil fuel companies to pay for climate damage. The movement will also work to re-energize youth climate protests, including school strikes, and is considering more disruptive nonviolent tactics. A key goal is to build momentum for a potential general strike in 2028, as advocated by the United Auto Workers president.</p>

This decision follows the bipartisan law passed last year that gave ByteDance until January 19 to sell TikTok's U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban, which Trump initially delayed and later extended due to tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that Tennessee can limit or fully ban gender transition care for young people, with justices voting 6 to 3 that a Tennessee law limiting access to treatments such as puberty blockers for under-18s was not discrimination. The ruling is expected to have a nationwide effect, as 25 states have similar laws. Three Tennessee transgender teenagers, their parents, and a doctor had argued the 2023 Tennessee ban violated the US constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law by discriminating on the basis of sex. The decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts, who stated that the law does not discriminate against transgender people.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the stereotype that straight men are bad at gossiping, exploring the reasons behind this perception and its potential impact on male loneliness. It challenges the notion that men don't gossip, citing research that shows men gossip at similar rates as women, but may lack the cultural opportunities and training to do so effectively. The article suggests that the fear of appearing "messy" or stirring the pot prevents men from fully engaging in gossip, which can be a valuable social tool for building intimacy and connection. Ultimately, the author poses the question of whether improving men's gossip skills could help address the male loneliness epidemic.</p>
