            <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance has arrived in India for a four-day visit focused on strengthening bilateral trade relations and avoiding potential U.S. tariffs. Vance is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss strategies for more than doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. The visit occurs amidst ongoing trade negotiations and concerns about potential tariffs from the Trump administration, making it a crucial opportunity to reinforce economic and diplomatic ties between the two nations, which is a close partnership and strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, a controversial symbol of Japan's past militarism, during its spring festival.

            <p>A recent survey indicates that Chinese universities have a surplus of postdoctoral positions, with only one job seeker for every five vacancies. This trend contrasts with the situation in the United States, where research funding has been cut. The study, based on an analysis of over 24,000 job postings and jobseekers, highlights a significant gap between available positions and the number of young researchers, particularly at the postdoctoral level, indicating a strong demand for talent in Chinese academia.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Gatwick Airport has been identified as the UK's worst airport for flight delays for the second consecutive year, with departures averaging over 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024. The airport has faced challenges due to air traffic control (ATC) disruptions both in Europe and within its own control tower. Birmingham and Manchester Airports also experienced significant delays, while Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality. Although passengers may be entitled to compensation for delays, ATC issues are considered extraordinary circumstances, making compensation unlikely.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry has found that "professional failures" contributed to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month, attributing the incident to an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF claims its troops believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces and that six of the casualties were Hamas members. The incident occurred in a hostile combat zone with poor visibility, with one commander dismissed and another reprimanded, while the Red Crescent and international organizations call for an independent investigation.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against making trade agreements with the United States that compromise Chinese interests amid President Donald Trump's tariffs. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson criticized Washington's plans to pressure countries into restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions. The spokesperson emphasized that appeasement would not bring peace and that China would resolutely take countermeasures against any deals made at its expense. The US has initiated tariff talks with trading partners, including Japan and South Korea, since Trump's return to the White House.</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing, such as Home Plate BBQ, are replacing U.S. beef with Australian beef due to the U.S.-China trade war and retaliatory tariffs. The high cost of American beef, compounded by a 125% tariff, makes it unaffordable for restaurants. The restaurant chain is also switching to Canadian pork ribs. This shift reflects the broader impact of the trade war on the availability and cost of goods in both countries, as Australian suppliers look to fill the gap.</p>

            <p>The Emergency Housing Vouchers program, which provides rental assistance to approximately 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence, is facing a severe funding shortage. The program, initiated in 2021, is expected to run out of funds by the end of next year, potentially leading to widespread evictions. Congress is being urged to allocate additional funds to sustain the program, but prospects for renewal remain uncertain amidst ongoing debates over federal spending. The loss of this assistance would significantly disrupt the lives of many vulnerable individuals and families.</p>

            <p>John Ullyot, the former chief Pentagon spokesperson, has predicted that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will soon be out of a job, citing a month of "total chaos" at the Pentagon. Ullyot highlighted issues ranging from leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings and revealed that more "bombshell" stories about Hegseth are forthcoming. Hegseth has faced scrutiny for sharing sensitive information outside official channels, particularly via the Signal messaging app, and three senior leaders were recently forced out amid an investigation into leaks.</p>

            <p>Malaysia Airlines' parent company, Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), is exploring the possibility of acquiring new Boeing 737 MAX jets if Chinese airlines decline deliveries due to ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Boeing appears to be returning some of its 737 MAX jets from China, raising the prospect of available delivery slots. MAG views this as an opportunity to expedite its fleet renewal and expansion plans, aiming to operate a narrow-body fleet of 55 new-generation 737 MAX aircraft by 2030.</p>

            <p>This is why America first doesn’t have to mean Europe last. The US president has said that the EU was created to “screw the United States” and slapped punitive tariffs on European goods. Historically, European integration tends to accelerate during crises and slacken when the pressure is off. The EU now faces twin existential challenges from a ruthless, revisionist Putin and a vandalistic, unpredictable Trump. Add to that a third, internal challenge from nationalist populism that could tear the union apart if the current generation of leaders doesn’t give Europe a fundamental new impulse.</p>

            <p>The author argues that the election of Donald Trump, despite the challenges it presents, offers a unique opportunity for European leaders to strengthen integration and global influence. Key steps include completing the European capital markets and banking union, forging trade deals with reliable partners, developing common defense capabilities, and providing greater support to Ukraine. By building international coalitions and expanding economic partnerships, Europe can offset the impact of Trump's policies and assert its role as a global leader.</p>

            <p>China has issued a strong warning against the trade tactics employed by the United States under President Donald Trump, stating that they will ultimately backfire. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce criticized Washington's attempts to pressure other countries into limiting trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions. The ministry emphasized that China will not tolerate any deals made at the expense of its interests and will take firm countermeasures. China maintains that such protectionist measures harm all countries and calls for a fair global trading system.</p>

            <p>The Easter weekend in Australia saw a tragic rise in drownings, with the death toll reaching seven after a nine-year-old boy became trapped between rocks at a New South Wales beach. The majority of deaths were attributed to strong swells washing people into the ocean from rocks. Authorities are urging caution near coastal areas, as two people remain missing. The CEO of Surf Life Saving in New South Wales described the situation as the "worst" spate of drownings on record for the Easter long weekend.</p>

The move follows recent economic data indicating better-than-expected growth in China, allowing the central bank to maintain its current monetary policy.

Russia has been enforcing content removal on foreign tech platforms, deeming certain information, like what it calls "fakes" about the war in Ukraine, as illegal, issuing fines for non-compliance.
