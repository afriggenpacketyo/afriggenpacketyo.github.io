          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, has been placed on indefinite paid leave after facing criticism for his handling of a lawsuit involving the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. During a hearing, Reuveni struggled to provide Judge Paula Xinis with details surrounding Abrego Garcia's deportation and the administration's reasons for not facilitating his return. Reuveni expressed his own frustration at not having the answers to the judge's questions, leading to the DOJ's decision to place him on leave for "failure to zealously advocate" for the government's interests. The government is now seeking to appeal the judge's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return by Monday.</p>

          <p>Senior officials in the Trump administration delivered conflicting messages regarding the president's global tariffs, causing turmoil in stock markets and raising concerns about a potential world recession. While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted the tariffs were here to stay, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins suggested negotiations with individual countries were still possible. The tariffs have drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, with some warning of dire economic consequences. Economists are increasingly pointing to the chances of a recession, with some estimating significant losses for US consumers.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's tariffs as a necessary measure to protect national security and re-industrialize the United States. Lutnick argued that the US needs to protect domestic industries like medicine, shipbuilding, and semiconductor manufacturing, which have become overly reliant on foreign sources. He claimed that the tariffs are intended to address the $1.2 trillion trade deficit and encourage companies to invest in America, emphasizing that the administration will protect businesses that choose to build factories in the US. Lutnick dismissed concerns about market panic, asserting that the tariffs are essential to reset global trade and ensure America's economic future.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that the Los Angeles Dodgers' decision to visit President Trump at the White House clashes with the team's history and values, particularly its association with Jackie Robinson. The columnist suggests that the Dodgers are normalizing Trump's rhetoric and behavior, which is seen as hypocritical given the team's past advocacy for social progress. The decision is viewed as prioritizing a traditional reward for winning the World Series over standing against forces of hate. The team's management defends the decision as apolitical and a reward for the players, but critics argue that it sends a harmful message and undermines the team's connection with its diverse fanbase.</p>
