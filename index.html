          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, ending a contentious contract stalemate. The Packers signed Parsons to a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons expressed excitement about joining the storied franchise and aims to build a legacy similar to Packers legends like Reggie White. The trade involved Green Bay sending two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is facing significant challenges implementing manager Ruben Amorim's rigid 5-2-3 positional system, highlighted by a recent loss to Grimsby Town. The article analyzes how Amorim's tactics, which rely on creating numerical overloads through specific passing patterns, are being effectively countered by opponents using man-to-man marking. The system's lack of encouragement for individual dribbling and roaming makes it predictable and less effective against disciplined defenses. Amorim may need to adapt his strategy to suit the higher competition level of the Premier League.</p>

          <p>North Korea has become the second-largest buyer of Chinese bottled wine by volume, importing over 157,000 liters in the first seven months of 2025. This figure represents more than double the volume from the same period last year, with purchases totaling over half a million US dollars. Despite extensive international sanctions on luxury goods, alcohol is not on the United Nations' banned list for North Korea. China has not imposed its own restrictions, allowing the trade to flourish between the two allied nations.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has asserted that frozen Russian assets will not be returned to Moscow until it pays reparations for the war in Ukraine. The EU holds approximately 210 billion euros in frozen Russian assets under sanctions imposed after the 2022 invasion. While Ukraine and some member states advocate for confiscating these assets to support Kyiv, other nations like France and Germany have raised legal concerns. The debate is now shifting towards how these funds could be utilized once the conflict concludes.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men under the age of 22 to leave the country, a change from the previous ban on men aged 18 to 60. The government's stated goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and work abroad, hoping they will later contribute to the nation's development. This policy addresses concerns that the travel ban was causing a "lost generation" as young men feared returning home. However, some demographic experts worry the change will exacerbate population decline rather than encourage return.</p>

          <p>A non-sworn employee of the Los Angeles Police Department's security services division accidentally shot himself on Friday at City Hall East. According to sources, the employee was at a desk in the building's lobby when his personal firearm discharged, causing a graze wound. The LAPD confirmed an "unintentional discharge" occurred and that there were no serious injuries. The department's Internal Affairs division is now investigating the incident, which prompted a temporary lockdown of the lobby area.</p>
