          <p>The U.S. Air Force is actively developing plans to integrate drones piloted by artificial intelligence into its combat formations, flying alongside traditional human-piloted aircraft. This initiative represents a potential revolution in aerial warfare, as AI systems are being trained to learn combat tactics and operate autonomously. The program, being tested at bases like Eglin Air Force Base, is part of a broader military strategy to prepare for future threats by leveraging cutting-edge autonomous technology.</p>

          <p>A shooting between rival gunmen in a crowded downtown area of Montgomery, Alabama, resulted in two deaths and twelve injuries late Saturday night. According to the Montgomery Police Chief, three of the injured individuals sustained life-threatening wounds in the incident, which he described as a "mass shooting." Authorities stated that the shooters showed no regard for the public as they opened fire in the middle of a crowd, and an investigation is currently underway to identify and charge those involved.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting to a more confrontational "eco-populist" strategy to capitalize on its growing membership. Polanski's approach involves "picking fights" to gain media attention and appeal to voters disillusioned with mainstream politics, a tactic some members see as necessary to counter right-wing populism. While this bold new direction aims to turn momentum into electoral power, some within the party worry it could alienate rural voters who were key to recent breakthrough wins.</p>

          <p>A growing number of states are mandating cellphone restrictions in public schools, forcing students to navigate the school day without their devices. At Jericho High School in New York, students initially experienced separation anxiety but later reported being more engaged in class discussions and "living more in the moment." Educators note that the ban has made the cafeteria twice as loud, with more students talking to each other, suggesting the policy is fostering better communication skills and reducing a major classroom distraction.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the current negotiations represent the closest point yet to securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. While expressing hope for a breakthrough, he cautioned that significant obstacles remain and that key logistical details of the proposed peace plan still need to be finalized. Rubio emphasized that the U.S. wants the first phase of the deal, the return of hostages, to happen quickly to build momentum for the rest of the agreement, with negotiators set to meet in Cairo.</p>

          <p>Following a request from President Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission is developing a proposal to potentially allow public companies to file financial reports semi-annually instead of quarterly. The change aims to reduce costs and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy, though it could significantly impact the revenue of major accounting firms that audit these reports. While proponents argue it could encourage more companies to go public, critics worry that less frequent reporting might reduce market transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed in what police are treating as a terrorist attack outside a Manchester synagogue on the holy day of Yom Kippur. The attacker, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, used a vehicle to ram into people before attempting to enter the building with a knife; he was shot and killed by police at the scene. One of the deceased victims was tragically hit by police gunfire as officers engaged the suspect, and three other people were seriously injured during the incident.</p>

          <p>Anze Kopitar, the longtime captain of the Los Angeles Kings, has announced that he will retire from the NHL at the age of 38 following the conclusion of the upcoming season.

          <p>At 70, pioneering Colombian marine biologist Elvira Alvarado is leading efforts to save the nation's endangered coral reefs through in-vitro fertilization. Her team collects coral eggs and sperm during the annual spawning event, fertilizes them in a lab, and nurtures the hatchlings before transplanting them back onto dying reefs. This technique aims to regenerate coral faster than it is being destroyed by disease, pollution, and rising ocean temperatures, with a focus on reproducing hardier varieties that are more resistant to environmental stressors.</p>

          <p>The BMJ Group has retracted a study published in March 2024 that claimed apple cider vinegar could lead to significant weight loss, citing "concerns raised about the quality of the work." The original study, which reported that participants lost about 9% of their body mass, had attracted global media attention but was met with skepticism from nutrition experts who found the results implausible. This retraction is the latest setback for the product, which has been promoted by celebrities but questioned by scientific and medical institutions.</p>

          <p>A pirate flag from the Japanese anime series "One Piece" has become a unifying symbol for Gen Z-led protests across the globe, from Nepal to Morocco. The flag, representing a band of rebels fighting an oppressive world government in the show, resonates with young people who feel unheard and trapped by corrupt or unjust systems. This adoption of a pop culture icon for political expression allows disparate protest movements to signal solidarity and connect their local struggles to a shared global narrative of resistance.</p>
