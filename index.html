          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns. The order also places partial restrictions on travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Trump stated the decision was influenced by foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals, emphasizing the need to protect the U.S. from inadequately vetted foreign nationals. This action expands upon previous travel bans and has drawn criticism for potentially discriminating based on ethnicity and separating families. The new restrictions are set to take effect soon, prompting concerns from various advocacy groups and Democratic lawmakers, who argue the ban contradicts American values and could harm the economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has initiated an investigation into former President Joe Biden's actions while in office, alleging that Biden's top aides concealed his cognitive decline. The inquiry will build upon Republican-led efforts to discredit Biden and overturn some of his executive actions, including presidential pardons and federal rules. GOP lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical faculties. Trump's memo also targets Biden's use of an autopen for signing executive actions, with the investigation focusing on who was truly in charge during Biden's presidency. Democrats have criticized the investigation as a distraction, while former President Bill Clinton has defended Biden's mental soundness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, escalating the administration's conflict with the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to attend Harvard, unless their entry is deemed in the national interest. The order claims Harvard is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs, accusing the school of failing to report disciplinary records and citing ties to researchers in China. A Harvard spokesperson has condemned the order as retaliatory and a violation of the school's First Amendment rights. The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, alleging failures in handling pro-Palestinian protests and antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to reverse course on winter fuel payments in her upcoming spending review, according to reports. The payment will be restored but then clawed back from higher-income pensioners through increased taxes. There are concerns about potential chaos as tax officials may pursue bereaved families of deceased pensioners to recover the payments. The reversal could mean that 1.3 million more people are likely to receive the payment this year. The chancellor has also reportedly received a donation from a lobbying firm connected to a Thames Water bidder.</p>

Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello stated that being in the United States poses a great risk for anyone, not just Venezuelans. Venezuelans are among those affected by partial restrictions, with full travel restrictions imposed on 12 other countries. Approximately 350,000 Venezuelans reside in the United States, and the Trump administration has broadly ended deportation protections previously given to Venezuelans.</p>

          <p>Jurors in Karen Read’s murder retrial will have a day off due to extreme heat, as announced by Norfolk Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone. Read is accused of striking her boyfriend, John O’Keefe, with her car and leaving him to die in a blizzard. Testimony was paused after Canton snowplow driver Brian Loughran testified he didn't see anything on the lawn where O’Keefe was found, and Canton resident Karina Kolokithas recalled Read and O’Keefe lovingly embracing each other the night before his death. A mistrial was declared in the first trial after jurors reached an impasse.</p>

The bill has faced opposition from various factions within the Republican Party, and its future in the Senate remains uncertain (not investment advice).</p>
