          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, detailed the administration's plans for enacting a new healthcare law affecting drug costs and Medicaid. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Oz defended new tariffs on imported medicines, stating that a "most favored nation" pricing strategy would prevent costs from being passed to consumers and address global freeloading on U.S. drug development. He also explained that new work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients would be managed through a modern app-based system, arguing technology will streamline the process and connect people to employment opportunities, improving the program's sustainability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Mexico's Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, expressed strong skepticism about the implementation of the new federal healthcare law discussed by CMS Administrator Dr. Oz. In an interview on "Face the Nation," she argued that the law's requirements would create a bureaucratic nightmare for states, providers, and patients without improving health outcomes. Lujan Grisham contended that while her state is financially stable temporarily, it cannot sustain the long-term financial burden, estimating a loss of $12-13 billion over a decade. She warned that the changes would lead to the closure of rural hospitals and catastrophic cuts to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat, an incident that also threw a passenger overboard. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center reported that the collision caused the vessel to nearly capsize, though the passenger is believed to be unharmed. The deceased whale came to rest on a shallow sandbar, making immediate examination difficult due to tidal conditions. Officials plan to tow the carcass to a state park for a necropsy on Monday to determine the exact cause of death and are advising boaters to use caution in the area.</p>

Canadian officials have signaled they prioritize a quality deal over a rushed one, leveraging the fact that nearly 90% of Canadian exports still enter the U.S. duty-free under the existing CUSMA/USMCA agreement. Talks are expected to continue, with both sides facing domestic pressure to find a resolution and provide certainty for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-term financial health of the U.S. Social Security system is facing renewed scrutiny amid administrative challenges and policy changes. According to a CBS News report, the Social Security Administration was already at its smallest size in 50 years before recent staff reductions, raising concerns about its ability to serve millions of Americans. Former SSA commissioner Michael Astrue warned that current administration officials may not fully understand the system's complexities, potentially putting benefits at risk for retirees. The issue highlights the growing anxiety many Americans feel about the reliability of the nation's primary retirement safety net. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Soccer superstar Lionel Messi left Inter Miami's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes after suffering an apparent hamstring injury. The 38-year-old fell after a challenge and was seen walking off the field before being substituted in the 11th minute. Coach Javier Mascherano confirmed Messi felt a "pull" and would undergo testing to determine the injury's severity, putting his availability for the team's next match in jeopardy. The incident adds to concerns about managing Messi's workload, as he has dealt with various leg injuries over the past few seasons.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' public trade request as a negotiation tactic and stated he has no intention of trading him. The standoff stems from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL. Jones insisted the situation is a normal part of the process when negotiating large contracts, comparing it to past disputes with other star players. Despite the public friction and support for Parsons from teammates, Jones expressed confidence that the issue would be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has provoked widespread condemnation by visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing "status quo" agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, but not to pray there. The visit was called an "unacceptable provocation" by Jordan, the site's custodian, and drew sharp criticism from Palestinian leaders. Despite the Israeli prime minister's office insisting that policy has not changed, the incident has heightened tensions surrounding one of the Middle East's most volatile holy sites.</p>

          <p>Public records have revealed that actor Sydney Sweeney registered as a Republican voter in Florida in June 2024, a few months before Donald Trump's second presidential victory. The revelation went viral amid a separate controversy surrounding a new American Eagle ad campaign where the actor stars in a series of ads playing on the word "genes." Some critics called the ad's theme tone-deaf in the current political climate, while conservatives praised it for pushing back against "woke" advertising. Sweeney had previously faced political scrutiny in 2022 over photos from a family party where guests wore hats resembling MAGA apparel.</p>

          <p>China's advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has apparently conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone for the nation's naval modernization. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a jet for take-off from the carrier, which is China's first to be equipped with this modern launch technology. This system allows for the launch of heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump ramps on China's older carriers. The successful drill marks a significant step towards the Fujian's expected entry into service later this year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent series of bizarre public statements and unprompted rants have renewed questions among some mental health experts about his cognitive fitness. The article highlights several instances, including a lengthy, off-topic monologue about windmills during a meeting with European officials and a confabulated story about his uncle and the Unabomber. Psychologists cited in the article note that Trump's tendency to digress, misremember facts, and exhibit incoherent thinking patterns are potential signs of cognitive deterioration. The White House has aggressively pushed back, asserting that the 79-year-old president is mentally and physically sharper than ever.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For couples facing marital difficulties without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key steps to protect personal finances. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, as access can become more difficult after a separation. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that these measures can provide security and clarity for both parties should the marriage ultimately end.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming phrases can be highly effective in managing children's tantrums. The article suggests that instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, parents should use language that validates their feelings and offers reassurance. Phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child's nervous system regulate by making them feel safe and understood. This connection-based approach aims to prevent meltdowns by addressing the underlying distress rather than just the behavior.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Rebecca Solnit contends that focusing on individual high-profile sexual abuse cases, such as those involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, masks the pervasive and systemic nature of violence against women. The article argues that treating these incidents as shocking aberrations prevents society from recognizing misogyny as the root cause and developing systemic solutions. Solnit points out that this violence is a constant, global pandemic that shapes women's lives and enforces inequality, rather than a series of isolated crimes. The essay calls for a broader societal conversation and fundamental change beyond just prosecuting individual powerful men.</p>
