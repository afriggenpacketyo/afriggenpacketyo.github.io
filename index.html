          <p>Prince Andrew has relinquished the use of his royal titles, including Duke of York, following public outcry and renewed scrutiny over his association with Jeffrey Epstein. While this move is a significant symbolic gesture of displeasure from Buckingham Palace, the article suggests it will have limited impact on his daily life, as he retains his Prince title and residence. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles and Prince William, aims to distance the Royal Family from the scandal, but questions about Andrew's past and upcoming revelations, like Virginia Giuffre's memoir, are expected to continue.</p>

          <p>Bosnia's Serb Republic parliament has appointed Ana Trisic Babic as interim president, officially marking the departure of former President Milorad Dodik, who was banned from politics by a state court. The parliament also annulled several separatist laws passed over the past year, a move welcomed by the U.S. State Department as a result of U.S.-led efforts to defuse the regional crisis. While Dodik, a pro-Russian nationalist, still aims for secession, this development signals a step towards greater stability and constructive partnership with the United States.</p>

          <p>A McDonald's worker in Polk County, Florida, shot a customer in the neck during a heated altercation that Sheriff Grady Judd dubbed a "McMess." The incident began when the worker informed two customers of delays in online orders, leading to threats of violence against him. As the dispute escalated inside the restaurant and the customers allegedly tried to grab the worker's gun, he fired, causing a minor wound. The worker was charged with felony tampering with evidence, while the customers faced charges of trespass and disorderly conduct.</p>

Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, will no longer be required to pay restitution to his victims. The decision drew criticism from other Republicans, including Congressman Nick LaLota, who argued Santos deserved a longer sentence for his crimes.

          <h2>Virginia Giuffre's Brother Calls for Complete Stripping of Prince Andrew's Royal Status</h2>

          <p>Sky Roberts, brother of the late Virginia Giuffre, has urged King Charles to strip Prince Andrew of his 'prince' title, arguing that Andrew's recent decision to cease using other royal titles does not go far enough. Roberts believes that anyone implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal should face full accountability, viewing Andrew's partial renunciation as a vindication for survivors but emphasizing that more justice is needed. Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had alleged sexual assault by Andrew when she was underage, claims he has consistently denied. Her posthumous memoir is set for publication next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average 401(k) balance for "upper class" individuals, defined by household incomes of $169,800 or more, is surprisingly low at around $377,000, with a median of $221,000. This figure falls significantly short of expert recommendations to save ten times one's salary by retirement age. The article suggests that many high earners prioritize current luxuries over fully funding their retirement accounts, leading to a potential financial gap in later years. While they tend to save more than lower-income groups, a focus on present consumption can hinder long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vermont State Senator Samuel Douglass has resigned from his position following the exposure of racist and antisemitic messages within a Young Republican group chat, a scandal that also led to the revocation of the New York state Young Republicans’ charter.

While Vice President JD Vance downplayed the exchanges as "edgy jokes," the incident underscores ongoing political polarization and bigotry within certain political circles.</p>
