          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features aimed at young users, in response to lawsuits and criticism regarding the app's impact on mental health, particularly among children. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" and enabled by default for users under 18, interrupting their "For You" feed with reminders. This initiative follows public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to kids, posing risks such as depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia. The company hopes these new tools will promote healthier digital habits for its young audience. </p>

          <p>China conveyed a clear message to the U.S. during recent trade discussions in Geneva: resolving concerns with the world trading system requires a multilateral approach. By holding the meetings at the UN ambassador's residence in Switzerland, China signaled to the U.S. President that trade resolutions should occur within a multilateral framework, utilizing the World Trade Organization and other UN entities headquartered in Geneva. While headline tariffs were reduced from unsustainable levels, these cuts primarily reversed measures that were non-compliant with WTO rules, emphasizing China's commitment to multilateral trade governance. The presence of Li Chenggang, China's WTO ambassador, further underscored this emphasis on multilateralism.</p>

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, as wealthy consumers continue to spend despite global economic uncertainties. While overall sales rose 7% year-on-year, the specialist watchmakers segment experienced a decline, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, influenced by a 23% drop in China. Richemont's Chairman acknowledged ongoing global uncertainties, including gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, but noted that the company's pricing power could provide a buffer. Despite these headwinds, the company remains optimistic about its ability to navigate the evolving luxury market landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the phenomenon of mud balls in golf, which occur when golf balls become covered in mud and dirt during adverse weather conditions, significantly affecting their flight and trajectory. Mud balls can cause unpredictable spins and make it difficult for players to control their shots. While preferred lies are often in place during regular tournaments, allowing players to clean their balls, the PGA Championship organizers have the discretion to decide whether to implement this rule. The presence of mud balls can add an element of unpredictability to the game, especially during periods of bad weather.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland's coalition government, led by Donald Tusk, is facing diminished approval ratings due to President Andrzej Duda's obstruction of its reform plans, making the upcoming presidential election crucial for the government's agenda. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) party. The outcome will determine whether the government can advance its promises to restore the rule of law, liberalize abortion legislation, and reform public media, all of which have been stymied by the conservative president's vetoes and constitutional court referrals. The election's result will significantly impact the government's ability to fulfill its campaign pledges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7 percent annualized contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in a year, due to sluggish domestic demand and rising import costs. This contraction occurred before the full impact of increased U.S. tariffs, raising concerns about further economic slowdown. Private consumption showed minimal growth, as inflation outpaced wage increases, and exports declined due to lower charges for intellectual property rights. Economists anticipate further deceleration in the coming quarters, contingent on the progress of trade negotiations with the United States aimed at reducing the imposed tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, featuring major changes after intense scrutiny, including the removal of the need for a High Court judge to approve each request. The bill now proposes a panel of experts, including a legal professional, psychiatrist, and social worker, to oversee the process. MPs are considering amendments to ensure no one is obligated to participate in assisted dying and to prevent doctors from discussing it with under-18s unless the patient initiates the conversation. A government impact assessment projects potential NHS savings but has faced criticism for errors in calculating the number of assisted deaths, leading to a chaotic process and raising questions about the bill's suitability.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations are urgently seeking discussions with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to address concerns over U.S. tariffs before a 90-day pause on those tariffs expires in July. The meeting in South Korea provided an opportunity for Asian economies and the U.S. to meet since President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on trading partners. South Korea's trade minister emphasized that many countries sent ministers to push for meetings with Greer, and experts noted that the primary goal was to gain face time with the U.S. negotiator due to the looming deadline. While Britain has reached an agreement with the Trump administration, many countries are still seeking to negotiate trade deals.</p>

This contrasts with his domestic policy of investigating political opponents and critics, but aligns with his admiration for strongman leaders like Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.

While analysts view the conflict as more of a draw, Pakistan's ability to hold its own against India has pushed its dire problems into the background, fostering a sense of national pride. The military, under Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has used this opportunity to rehabilitate its image and deflect accusations of political repression, though this support could wane if the military is seen as overreaching in politics.

While many Democrats would prefer to focus on Trump's policies, Republicans are betting that voters will still prefer him over memories of Biden's unpopular presidency.

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are set to meet in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the start of the war, despite low expectations for significant progress. While the meeting is seen as a win for President Putin, who refused a battlefield cease-fire, President Zelensky has questioned Russia's seriousness and the organization of the talks. The Trump administration has cast doubt on the talks' prospects, emphasizing that a breakthrough will only come through a meeting between Trump and Putin. The negotiations may be an attempt by Putin to maintain Trump's attention and convince the White House that he is not obstructing peace, while also seeking Ukraine's capitulation.</p>

          <p>Republican-led states are intensifying efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, expanding from higher education to other government functions, spurred by President Trump's embrace of the movement. Governors and lawmakers have doubled actions targeting DEI initiatives this year, mirroring a legislative model promoted by conservative think tanks. These efforts aim to abolish DEI offices and staff, end mandatory diversity training, ban compulsory diversity statements, and outlaw racial or sexual preferences in hiring and admissions. While some components of DEI programs have support among Americans, the term has become politically toxic, leading to voluntary withdrawals of DEI programs by businesses.</p>

          <p>A transit strike began in New Jersey as locomotive engineers walked off their jobs, shutting down NJ Transitâ€™s rail network and leaving thousands of commuters scrambling for alternative transportation. The strike, the first statewide transit worker strike in the state since 1983, stems from a dispute over pay, with the union demanding parity with engineers at other regional railroads. While NJ Transit's bus system continues to operate, chartered buses can only accommodate a fraction of the displaced train riders. The strike is expected to significantly impact productivity in New York City, with experts warning of ripple effects across other transit systems and increased congestion on roads.</p>

          <p>Beijing is intensifying efforts to strengthen its domestic market, aiming to reduce China's vulnerability to external tariff shocks amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of bolstering "domestic circulation" to enhance the country's economic self-reliance by creating a robust and unified domestic market. This strategy aims to harness the economy's internal stability and long-term growth potential to offset global uncertainties. The confrontation with Washington has added urgency to China's efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce dependence on overseas trade, as the government recognizes the limitations of relying on exports as the dominant growth driver.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, shedding light on the prehistoric human expansion. The study reveals that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region, and that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work could provide insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced major population declines. Archaeological evidence shows human migration from northern Asia to South America occurred at least 23,000 years ago.</p>
