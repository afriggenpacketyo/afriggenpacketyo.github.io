          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has reportedly agreed to plead guilty to all charges. This plea deal would spare him the death penalty, resulting instead in four consecutive life sentences without parole. The agreement was communicated to the victims' families, with the family of Kaylee Goncalves expressing frustration over the deal and the process. The change of plea hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, aiming to bring a conclusion to the case without a prolonged trial and appeals process.</p>

          <p>A significant escalation in cartel violence in CuliacÃ¡n, the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state, has led to at least 20 deaths in a single day. Authorities discovered four decapitated bodies hanging from a highway bridge and another 16 victims with gunshot wounds inside a van. The violence is attributed to an ongoing, bloody war for control between two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, known as Los Chapitos and La Mayiza. The conflict has destabilized the region, with daily violence becoming common since a power struggle erupted last year.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old former teacher at a charter school in Waterford Township, Michigan, is facing criminal charges for an alleged sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student. The accusations came to light after the teacher, Jocelyn Sanroman, allegedly confided in a coworker who then reported the information to the police. The Oakland County Prosecutor emphasized the breach of trust involved, stating that while a 16-year-old can consent, the power dynamic with a teacher makes such a relationship exploitative. If convicted of third-degree sexual conduct, Sanroman could face up to 15 years in prison.</p>

Fire officials have achieved partial containment on several fires but warn that these events are a prelude to a challenging season due to dry conditions.

          <p>A coalition of more than 130 non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam and Save the Children, is demanding the closure of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The charities argue that the aid system, backed by Israel and the US, is unsafe and violates humanitarian norms by forcing people into militarized zones. They report that since the GHF began operations, over 500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 4,000 injured while seeking aid, often due to fire from Israeli forces and armed groups. Israel denies deliberately targeting civilians and maintains the system is necessary to bypass Hamas.</p>

          <p>The amount of money needed for retirement varies significantly from person to person, posing a challenge for setting effective pension policies. Research from Hargreaves Lansdown examined different adequacy measures, including fixed income benchmarks and relative measures like target replacement rates of pre-retirement earnings. The analysis found that simple "pounds and pence" targets may not be suitable for higher earners, potentially giving them a false sense of security. Conversely, such targets might discourage lower earners who don't need as much to maintain their lifestyle, highlighting the need for personalized financial planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investment company Aberdeen Group plc (Abrdn) has suddenly terminated its Financial Fairness Trust, which for 16 years funded influential research on economic inequality. The move, which included the immediate dismissal of its CEO and trustees, has drawn sharp criticism from the research community. The trust supported prominent organizations like the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation. Critics suggest the closure reflects a broader corporate trend of retreating from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives amid political pressure, though the company denies this, citing a "natural evolution" in its charitable strategy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the near-total absence of France's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade from its national cinema, contrasting it with American films that often serve as the main reference. The author notes that despite France's history as the second-largest colonial empire, its stories of enslavement remain largely invisible on screen. The article highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" as rare but important efforts to address this historical blind spot. It argues that while audiences are ready to engage with this past, these films are still marginalized by the mainstream French film industry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate held a marathon "vote-a-rama" session to advance a massive tax, border, and defense bill backed by former President Donald Trump. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to pass the legislation with a simple majority, aiming to send it to Trump's desk by a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The bill, which the CBO estimates will increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion, includes spending increases offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Democrats used the session to force votes on controversial amendments, highlighting political divisions ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

They urged that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) target violent criminals rather than conducting sweeping raids that they say are instilling fear and causing labor shortages in key industries. The letter, led by State Sen. Suzette Valladares, argues the current tactics are harming communities and businesses. While supporting the deportation of criminals, they call for a more targeted approach and an expansion of legal guest worker programs.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills aimed at speeding up construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which Newsom forced through by linking it to the state budget, exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews. This move sidestepped opposition from some labor groups by only requiring union-level wages for high-rise and low-income developments. Development experts believe these are the most substantial changes to CEQA in its 55-year history and will provide a major boost to housing production in the state.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine prevents inflammation and the aging of organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The discovery could also lead to new strategies for simulating the effects of exercise to promote longevity and health.</p>
