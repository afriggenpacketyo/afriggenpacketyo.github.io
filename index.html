          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to revoke temporary protected status for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially subjecting them to deportation. This decision reverses a lower court's block on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's move to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Venezuelans. The TPS program allows individuals from countries facing unsafe conditions to live and work legally in the US. Activists and legal representatives have criticized the decision, while the Department of Homeland Security has praised it as a win for American safety.</p>
