        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After nine months of peaceful demonstrations, Serbia is experiencing escalating violence as protesters clash with police and alleged paramilitary groups. Demonstrators report widespread police brutality, including beatings and threats of sexual assault, while the government, led by President Aleksandar Vucic, accuses citizens of attempting to destroy the state. With mass arrests occurring and Vucic promising a harsh response, the situation remains volatile, with outcomes ranging from a state of emergency to new elections being considered. The conflict has created a deeply uncertain and unsafe environment for citizens involved in the protests.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the United States has experienced its largest-ever collapse in commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has surged to a record high, solidifying its position as the world's top apiary producer. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences attribute this stark contrast to different management practices. The US model often involves large-scale, clustered operations with minimal intervention, whereas Chinese practices may offer a different approach that has resulted in a 25% increase in colonies. This divergence highlights critical factors that could inform strategies for bee conservation and honey production globally.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian contends that the European Union's failure to take decisive action against Israel's military operations in Gaza is rooted in structural racism and a colonial mentality. The author highlights the disparity between the EU's strong response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its paralysis regarding the Palestinian situation, pointing to the bloc's significant trade relationship with Israel as a factor. The article calls for a moral reckoning, urging the EU to confront its double standards and apply its stated principles of international law and human rights consistently to maintain credibility.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson, effectively ending their hopes of playing this season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing its "Five-Year Rule" violated antitrust laws by limiting their NIL earning potential. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny. This decision deals a significant blow to both university football programs, which had counted on the players for key roles in the upcoming season.</p>

The case, which highlights the controversial conditions and legal uncertainties at the temporary detention center, will be transferred to a different federal court. Another pending lawsuit seeks to halt the facility's operations over environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Seattle's police chief, Shon Barnes, was reportedly having lunch just yards away from a jewelry store as four masked robbers executed a brazen daylight heist, stealing an estimated $2 million in valuables. The incident at Menashe & Sons Jewelers was over in approximately 90 seconds, with the suspects using a hammer to break in and threatening staff with bear spray. A police department spokesperson confirmed the chief was at a nearby business but was unaware of the crime as it unfolded. No arrests have been made, and the investigation into the high-value robbery is ongoing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted to achieve this goal. He asserted that mail-in ballots are inherently corrupt and undermine election integrity, despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. Constitutional experts note that Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections, suggesting any such executive order would face significant legal challenges. The move represents a major effort to reshape election laws based on long-standing claims about voter fraud.</p>

While a doctoral student at Washington State University, he was described as "creepy" and "sexist," with one faculty member warning he could become a predator. The documents detail nine formal complaints about his conduct and note that his behavior changed after the murders, as he appeared more disheveled and stopped bringing his phone to class.

          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that Chinese exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the start of the US-China trade war. Over the past five years, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the 28% growth in exports to the United States and Western Europe. This shift suggests a potential reordering of global commerce, with South-South trade becoming more central and Chinese firms expanding their influence in developing nations. The trend is expected to continue as Chinese companies seek to mitigate uncertainties from US tariffs and a domestic economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has the highest number of "abandoned seafarers" globally, with nearly 900 Indian nationals among the 3,133 sailors left stranded on ships in 2024. Seafarers become abandoned when shipowners cut ties, failing to pay wages or provide for their repatriation, often leaving them in precarious situations in foreign waters. A key factor is the use of "flags of convenience," where ships are registered in countries with lax regulations, obscuring ownership and accountability. The complex, globalized nature of the shipping industry further complicates efforts to resolve these crises, trapping crews in disputes far from home.</p>

The piece suggests that while convenient in the short term, this reliance is not a sustainable long-term solution.

          <p>Alibaba's AI coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained global popularity since its release in July, capturing over 20% of the usage share on the AI marketplace OpenRouter. This places it second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, which is widely considered the top model in the AI-assisted coding sector. Alibaba claims its model's performance is on par with the industry leader, attributing its success to improved data quality and large-scale reinforcement learning. The model's rise comes as competition intensifies, with numerous Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent also launching their own AI coding tools.</p>

          <p>Aligning with a national strategy, China's coastal provinces are rolling out ambitious plans to develop their marine economies, focusing on areas like digital governance, offshore energy, and tourism. Since the marine economy was included in China's 2035 vision, ten provincial-level regions have introduced development plans. For example, Fujian province is building a pioneering marine data platform that has already aggregated billions of data entries for use in ecological protection and emergency response. The province also aims to significantly expand its offshore wind and solar power production, reflecting a broader push to leverage maritime resources for new growth.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Justice Department over a new rule that ties billions of dollars in federal grants for crime victims to immigration enforcement cooperation. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally forcing states to choose between forfeiting critical funding for services like crisis centers and domestic abuse hotlines, or complying with unlawful demands to assist federal immigration agents. The states contend that the law establishing the grant program includes no provisions for immigration enforcement, and that the new rule will destroy trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. The facility, which can eventually hold up to 5,000 people, is the latest and largest in a series of new centers established by the Trump administration to support its mass deportation mandate. Critics and local Democratic representatives have condemned the high cost and purpose of the facility, demanding that detainees have proper access to legal counsel. Administration officials defended the center, stating it offers all necessary services and is intended for individuals who have no legal right to be in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide a prime opportunity to realign the league geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western Conferences. He argued that such a move would reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason and broadcast schedules, particularly for West Coast audiences. While this would likely face pushback from traditionalists, the commissioner suggested that owners recognize the benefits. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process approved by 2029, with Nashville and Salt Lake City considered leading candidate cities.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists has collected dozens of sediment cores from the Antarctic seabed to study centuries of environmental history. By analyzing the layers of mud, which act like a historical record, researchers will investigate the impact of human activities, such as industrial whaling, on the Southern Ocean and the global climate. The samples will be used to measure past pollution levels, track microbial life, and calculate how much carbon was stored on the seafloor. This research is part of a global effort to better understand the crucial connection between the ocean and climate change.</p>

          <p>A new court filing claims that the May arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was ordered directly by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The filing, from an attorney for Rep. LaMonica McIver, cites body camera footage in which a Homeland Security agent allegedly states he is arresting the mayor "per the deputy attorney general." The incident occurred when Baraka and other lawmakers were attempting an oversight visit at an immigration detention center. The revelation adds to concerns that the Justice Department is being used to target political opponents of the Trump administration, as charges against the mayor were later dropped.</p>

          <p>A massive, 113-year-old wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved 5 kilometers to a new location to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The entire 672-tonne structure has been hoisted onto rolling platforms for the two-day journey to the city's new center. This spectacular relocation is the most symbolic part of a broader effort to move the city, which is at risk from mining-related ground fissures. The mining company is funding the entire city relocation project, a complex engineering and logistical feat that is also deeply emotional for local residents.</p>
