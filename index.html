            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen alleges that El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and his officials orchestrated a setup, dubbed 'margarita-gate,' to defame him and Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a U.S. citizen wrongfully deported. Van Hollen claims that officials placed margarita glasses on the table during their meeting and insinuated that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member, allegations not supported by court documents. The senator emphasized that the U.S. government is not complying with a Supreme Court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, diverting attention by raising gang violence concerns. Van Hollen asserts that the case is about protecting the constitutional rights of all U.S. residents.</p>

            <p>The New York Rangers have fired head coach Peter Laviolette and associate head coach Phil Housley after a disappointing season where they missed the playoffs. Despite Laviolette having a 94-59-11 record over two seasons, the Rangers failed to meet expectations after a strong previous season. General manager Chris Drury cited the need for change to achieve the team's goals and will begin the search for a new head coach immediately.

            <p>Many international adoptees in the U.S. are discovering they lack citizenship, facing potential deportation and ineligibility for federal benefits. This issue stems from adoptive parents not completing the naturalization process or children entering the U.S. on incorrect visas. The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 provided automatic citizenship but excluded those over 18 at the time or born before February 1983. Advocates are pushing for Congress to remove the age cutoff and address the citizenship gap, particularly as adoptees feel increased fear under the current administration's deportation policies.</p>

            <p>An article discusses the negative stereotypes surrounding stepmothers in popular culture and their impact on modern women. A survey reveals that many single mothers are deterred from dating parents due to fears of being perceived as a 'wicked stepmother.' The piece explores the historical roots of this trope, drawing from myths and fairy tales, and encourages stepmothers to embrace the label while focusing on building genuine connections. The author suggests that children are primed to hate their mothers just as much, so fear of being a wicked stepmother shouldn't hold anyone back.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order forbidding the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants without due process, hinting at a possible shift in tolerance towards the administration's actions. The case, *A.A.R.P. v. Trump*, involves allegations that the government moved Venezuelan immigrants to a Texas detention facility without proper explanation or opportunity to challenge their removal. This order suggests the Court may no longer tolerate procedural tactics intended to evade meaningful judicial review, though Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.</p>
