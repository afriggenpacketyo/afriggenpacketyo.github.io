          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has reached a deal with Boeing to avoid prosecution over the two 737 Max crashes that resulted in 346 deaths. This non-prosecution agreement allows Boeing to avoid being labeled a felon, preventing a trial scheduled for next month. While Boeing has been attempting to move past the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, families of the victims have criticized previous agreements as lenient and continue to demand accountability from the company and its executives. Under the 2021 settlement, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.51 billion fine, which included compensation for the families, airlines, and a criminal penalty.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reignited trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union and a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in the United States.

          <p>Wall Street experienced a downturn following President Trump's threats of imposing significant tariffs on the European Union and Apple, sparking renewed concerns about trade. Trump's proposal of a 50% tariff on EU goods and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. has shifted market attention back to his aggressive trade policies. This development has led to a decline in stock index futures and an increase in the VIX volatility index, reflecting investor unease.

Wimmer, a devout Christian, argues that private citizens are still facing workplace discrimination related to DEI policies, despite efforts to roll back such requirements. Represented by the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty (WILL), Wimmer filed a religious discrimination complaint with the EEOC, asserting that Generac violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

If Apple is subjected to higher tariffs, it may need to increase iPhone prices to maintain profits, which would give Samsung a competitive edge. Trump has been pressuring Apple to manufacture iPhones in the U.S., and Cramer believes that a tariff on Apple would act as a subsidy for Samsung. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett argues that it is nearly impossible for Apple to relocate iPhone production to the U.S. in the near term.</p>

          <p>The Guardian analyzes President Trump's recent tariff threats against the EU and Apple, noting a recurring pattern in his trade strategy. This pattern includes an initial threat, followed by the imposition of tariffs, resulting in market panic, and ultimately leading to a backtrack. Despite the uncertainty created by these actions, investors appear to be taking Trump's tariff threats with a grain of salt.

Meanwhile, reductions in social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP could negatively impact lower-income individuals.

          <p>The New York Times reports that Republicans have included a variety of under-the-radar policy tweaks in their domestic policy bill. These include a tax break for the U.S. Virgin Islands, lighter regulation for A.I. companies, legal protections for Trump officials, a new break for investors, more generous terms for health savings accounts, and a shake-up to the tobacco industry. These provisions, often tangentially related to the rest of the bill, could have significant impacts across various sectors. The bill is now moving to the Senate, where these provisions may be changed.</p>
