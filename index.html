          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 17:30:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the closure of several establishments. The new measures would require developers building near existing venues to soundproof new properties and would streamline the process for opening new bars or expanding outdoor areas. While the government aims to revitalize struggling town centers, critics argue that other government policies have harmed the hospitality industry. The changes are intended to support al fresco dining and live performances year-round.</p>

          <p>Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America has confirmed a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of the majority of its 1.4 million U.S. customers. The incident occurred on July 16 when a hacker accessed a third-party, cloud-based system using a social engineering technique. The company stated that its own internal systems were not compromised and that it has notified the FBI and begun contacting affected individuals. Allianz Life is offering 24 months of identity theft protection and credit monitoring to those impacted by the breach.</p>

          <p>ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky recently discussed his decision to pray for Damar Hamlin on live television following Hamlin's cardiac arrest over two years ago. Orlovsky described the moment as "uncomfortable" but felt compelled to act after hearing many people offer "thoughts and prayers" without the act of prayer itself. He stated that the reaction to his on-air prayer was overwhelmingly positive from the public and from his employer, ESPN. Hamlin has since made a full recovery and returned to playing for the Buffalo Bills.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee have sent a letter to the representatives of Jeffrey Epstein's estate, requesting a copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for the disgraced financier. The request follows a Wall Street Journal report that the book contains a letter from Donald Trump, a claim Trump has denied and for which he has sued the publication. The lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation. This development comes as Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, is scheduled for a deposition with the committee.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test in a federal appeals court, which is set to hear arguments challenging his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, but that decision was paused pending the appeal. The outcome of this case could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs implemented by the administration, which argues that Congress has long granted presidents such powers for national security. The case is widely expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant security operation has been deployed in Scotland for Donald Trump's private visit, centered around his Turnberry golf resort. The visit has prompted protests and raised concerns from police representatives about the high cost to taxpayers and the strain on resources. While in the country, Trump is expected to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The large-scale security, including road closures and police sweeps, underscores the logistical and political complexities of hosting the US president, even on a private trip.</p>

          <p>The stock price for clothing brand American Eagle has seen a significant increase after launching a new advertising campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. The article suggests that the ads represent a successful return to a more product-focused marketing approach, moving away from the social messaging that has dominated recent advertising.

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently hold a majority, enabling them to block the agenda of President Lai Ching-te. The recall effort was driven by criticism that the opposition lawmakers were obstructing government functions and passing legislation seen as overly friendly to China.</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is healthy continues, with experts advising that the right amount is highly individual and moderation is key. While some studies link daily coffee consumption to health benefits and lower mortality rates, others show risks for certain populations, such as those with hypertension. The FDA recommends a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups of coffee. However, individual tolerance, overall health, and factors like pregnancy can significantly alter what is considered a safe amount.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were expelled by the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison are now alleging they were subjected to "state-sanctioned torture" during their detention. These men, who were never convicted of crimes in the U.S., were sent to the facility based on unsubstantiated gang affiliations. Following a prisoner swap deal, they have been repatriated to Venezuela and are sharing accounts of beatings, humiliation, and inhumane living conditions. Their lawyers argue the U.S. government knowingly sent them to be tortured, raising serious human rights concerns.</p>
