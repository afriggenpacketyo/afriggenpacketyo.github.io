          <p>Suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco was found guilty of sexual abuse in the Dominican Republic, receiving a two-year suspended sentence. The case involved a relationship with a 14-year-old girl, for which prosecutors had sought a five-year prison term. While acquitted of more severe charges like human trafficking, the judge admonished Franco during the ruling. The girl's mother was also found guilty and will serve a full 10-year sentence for her role in consenting to the illegal relationship in exchange for money, while Franco's attorney plans to appeal.</p>

It is not yet clear if any workers were injured in the collapse.

          <p>President Trump promoted his "big, beautiful bill" by featuring a third-generation Michigan autoworker, a lifelong Democrat who now supports him due to a proposed tax benefit. The plan would make interest on vehicle loans tax-deductible up to $10,000 annually, but only for passenger vehicles with final assembly in the United States. This policy is designed to incentivize domestic manufacturing and directly appeal to workers in the American auto industry. The provision is part of a larger legislative package that the administration is pushing to pass before the July 4th holiday.</p>

Prosecutors alleged he funneled over $100,000 in campaign donations for personal use, including trips to Las Vegas and wine country, with the help of his mother and a friend. As part of a plea deal, Navarro admitted to the felony, which will prevent him from holding public office in the future. Despite raising significant funds and gaining support from high-profile conservative figures, Navarro never received more than 25% of the vote in his campaigns.</p>

This follows an initial audit that led to the suspension of Escobar and two other union officials for failing to provide receipts and business purposes for their spending.

The legislation combines tax cut extensions with increased funding for immigration enforcement but faces significant hurdles due to its projected $4.2 trillion addition to the national deficit and opposition from moderate Republicans. Democrats have fiercely opposed the bill, citing deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs. The bill's path was further complicated when the Senate parliamentarian ruled that a key Medicaid-related provision violates budget reconciliation rules, making passage more difficult.</p>

The government maintains that progress is being made, citing a drop in the overall waiting list to its lowest in two years. However, patient groups and medical professionals express concern that the pace is too slow to meet the 2029 target, leaving many patients in prolonged pain.</p>

The complex investigation, which involves millions of documents, has identified seven suspects and is considering up to 50 potential suspects, including Post Office investigators and management. The scandal saw over 900 sub-postmasters wrongfully prosecuted due to faulty accounting software. While victims are desperate for accountability, the police emphasize the need for a meticulous process, which will not proceed to prosecution until after a public inquiry publishes its final report later this year.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old in Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that offers a potential cure for Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS). This rare, life-threatening inherited disorder, which claimed the lives of her mother and other relatives, severely weakens the immune system. The treatment was developed after Cambridge researchers identified the faulty gene responsible for the condition in 2013, a discovery in which the patient's family played a key role. The drug, taken as a twice-daily tablet, works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function properly.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower complaint from a former Justice Department lawyer alleges that top officials considered defying court orders to achieve the Trump administration's aggressive deportation targets. The complaint highlights a pattern of the administration allegedly ignoring or attempting to circumvent judicial rulings that block removals, such as in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. This analysis suggests that the administration's public goal of deporting one million people this year is unrealistic, given that ICE has only carried out about 125,000 removals so far. The administration's conflicts with the judiciary are framed as a response to these logistical shortcomings.</p>

While the median income for retirees over 65 is around $4,190 per month, the upper-class threshold is closer to $8,380.

          <h2>Congressional Republicans Remove 'Revenge Tax' Provision from Major Bill at Treasury's Request</h2>

          <p>Republican lawmakers have agreed to remove a controversial "revenge tax" provision from President Trump's major legislative package. The decision came after a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who cited a new agreement with G7 countries on a global tax deal that defends U.S. interests. The removed provision, Section 899, would have allowed taxes on companies with foreign owners from countries deemed to have unfair tax practices, which critics argued would deter foreign investment in the U.S. This change complicates Republican efforts to offset the cost of the bill as they rush to meet a July 4th deadline.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Expected to Concede on Welfare Reforms After Labour Rebellion</h2>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing a significant climbdown on its planned welfare benefit changes to avoid a major legislative defeat. Following a rebellion from over 100 Labour MPs, ministers are expected to agree that planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) will only apply to future claimants, protecting existing recipients. The deal would also fast-track a £1 billion support plan originally scheduled for 2029. This marks a substantial concession from the government, which had planned the reforms to save £5 billion annually and slow the rising cost of health-related benefits.</p>
