          <p>A new Pew Research Center study indicates that Islam is the fastest-growing religion globally, followed by the religiously unaffiliated. The Muslim population increased significantly between 2010 and 2020 due to natural demographic growth. Christianity remains the world's largest religion but declined as an overall slice of the world's population. The religiously unaffiliated group is now the third largest, with a notable increase in Europe and North America. Optimism score of 65.</p>
