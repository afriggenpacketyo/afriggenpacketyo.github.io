          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to unveil stricter immigration policies in response to growing voter discontent over high immigration levels. These measures include limiting skilled visas to graduate-level jobs and restricting lower-skilled visas to sectors critical to the industrial strategy. Businesses will also be required to invest more in training British workers, and the care sector will no longer be able to recruit workers from abroad using visas. The government aims to tighten control over work, family, and study visas, raise English language requirements for adult dependents, and increase enforcement to reduce overall migration numbers, responding to concerns about strained public services and ethnic tensions.</p>

          <p>Reports have emerged suggesting that China’s J-10C fighter jet outperformed France’s Rafale in an aerial clash between the Indian and Pakistan air forces. The Pakistan Air Force claimed to have shot down multiple Indian Rafale jets, which, if confirmed, would mark the first combat loss for the Rafale and a significant victory for the Chinese military asset. Both the Rafale and J-10C are considered 4.5-generation fighters, with the Rafale widely regarded as one of the most capable aircraft in its class. This analysis explores how the J-10C compares to the Rafale in terms of capabilities and performance.</p>

          <p>As Israel prepares "Gideon's Chariots," a plan involving mass destruction in Gaza, American public attention to the conflict is declining, creating a dangerous situation. This plan would give Palestinian civilians a choice between indefinite confinement in a small area or leaving Gaza, which some Israeli officials openly advocate. The author argues that this is the worst possible time to look away, as the war is on the brink of becoming unimaginably worse. With the US playing a crucial role in providing weapons and political cover to Israel, renewed public attention and moral outrage are needed to potentially change the course of the war.</p>

Despite Mexico's increased efforts to combat drug trafficking, President Sheinbaum has rejected Trump's offer to send U.S. troops, asserting that sovereignty is not negotiable. Experts believe that any U.S. incursion would create a serious crisis, but a complete rupture in diplomatic relations is unlikely due to Mexico's economic dependence on the U.S. Instead, Mexico might issue a formal protest, recall its ambassador, and temporarily reduce cooperation on immigration and security.

          <p>Casey Johnston, author of "A Physical Education: How I Escaped Diet Culture and Gained the Power of Lifting," discusses her journey from calorie-counting cardio to weightlifting and its transformative effects on her body and mind. Johnston highlights the misconceptions about muscle mass and caloric intake, emphasizing that eating too little can deplete muscle mass and lower metabolism. She encourages women to challenge societal norms around body image and reclaim their strength through weightlifting. By focusing on functional fitness and compound movements, Johnston advocates for a more trusting and intuitive relationship with one's body.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that burned lots in L.A. will remain vacant for decades unless Congress modifies the tax code to provide relief for fire victims. Current tax laws discourage fire victims from selling their properties due to income tax implications and also deter potential buyers. The proposed reforms include exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales, and allowing buyers to defer income taxes on the sale of a principal residence if the proceeds are used to rebuild in the fire areas. These changes aim to incentivize rebuilding and restore the tax base in affected communities.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation into faulty emergency alerts issued during the deadly January wildfires in Los Angeles County, Congressman Robert Garcia released a report calling for increased federal oversight of the nation’s emergency alert system. The investigation was prompted by a series of inaccurate evacuation alerts that were sent across the metropolitan region, causing widespread panic and confusion. The report identified a technical flaw in the software used by the county and criticized the vague wording of the original alert. Recommendations include more federal funding, improved training, and the establishment of performance standards for alert systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new studies on chimpanzee communication have identified key building blocks of human speech in our closest relatives. The research indicates that chimps use both rhythmic structures in their drumming and combinations of calls, mirroring essential elements of spoken language. These findings support the idea that human language may have evolved from existing primate communication methods. One study analyzed drumming patterns, revealing that different chimp populations use distinct rhythmic structures, similar to regional accents. Another study found that chimps combine calls to alter meanings, suggesting a shared motivation for communication rooted in social navigation.</p>

The PKK said it has "completed its historical mission" and would "end the method of armed struggle," paving the way for resolving the Kurdish issue through democratic politics. This move followed a call by the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the movement to dissolve itself. Both sides had reasons to do a deal now, with the PKK hit hard by the Turkish military and President Erdogan needing support from pro-Kurdish parties.</p>
