          <p>China's recent stimulus package, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, has not boosted its stock market as expected due to persistent worries about economic deterioration and ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. Investors had already factored in the policies, and concerns linger about the trade war's impact on China's economy. Analysts suggest that investors are awaiting more direct fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector. The article highlights that this stimulus is more targeted at industrial and social needs compared to previous market-backed initiatives.</p>
