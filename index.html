          <p>In Memphis, three former police officers, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, were acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols following a 2023 traffic stop. The jury deliberated for approximately 8 1/2 hours before reaching the verdict, leading to emotional reactions from the defendants and their families. Despite this acquittal, the officers still face potential imprisonment from federal charges related to the same incident. The case has drawn national attention and sparked renewed conversations about police brutality and accountability, especially in cases involving racial bias.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would maintain its benchmark interest rate, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs as it assesses the economic impact of his trade policies. The Fed cited increased economic risks, noting the potential for higher unemployment and inflation. While the jobless rate remains low, the central bank's decision reflects concerns over the effects of Trump's tariffs on the economy. Economists anticipate that the tariffs will likely boost inflation later in the year, influencing future monetary policy decisions.</p>
