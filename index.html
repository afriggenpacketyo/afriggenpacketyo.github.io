        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, in collaboration with Florida state law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 undocumented immigrants in a statewide operation this week. The operation, which began on Monday, specifically targeted immigrants with final deportation orders, reflecting the Trump administration's continued efforts to accelerate deportations. This marks the first operation conducted under a formal agreement with state law enforcement, highlighting increased cooperation between federal and state agencies in immigration enforcement efforts. This initiative underscores the administration's commitment to enforcing immigration laws and removing individuals with outstanding deportation orders from the United States.</p>

          <p>Two killer whales, Wikie and her son Keijo, are in need of a new home following the closure of Marineland Antibes in France. Animal rights groups are advocating for their relocation to a whale sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada, where they can enjoy more space and freedom from breeding or performance demands. While the French government seeks a European sanctuary, a previous offer from the Canadian sanctuary was rejected, and an application to move the whales temporarily to Loro Parque in Tenerife was blocked by Spanish authorities due to inadequate facilities. The situation highlights the debate over the welfare of orcas in captivity and the challenges of finding suitable sanctuaries.</p>

          <p>New polls indicate that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump. A majority described his second term as "scary," with low ratings on the economy and immigration. Only 24% believe Trump is focused on the right priorities, and approval ratings are historically low. The polls suggest growing fatigue with Trump's policies and leadership.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump questioned Vladimir Putin's intentions for peace after meeting Zelenskyy at the Vatican. Trump suggested that Putin may not want to stop the war in Ukraine. The meeting came during a period of tension between the U.S. and Europe, particularly over the White House's policies on migration. Whether the symbolism of the summit will translate into policy remains to be seen.</p>
