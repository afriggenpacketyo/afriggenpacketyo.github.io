          <p>President Trump has postponed widespread tariff increases but has notified 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, of specific new rates that could become effective August 1. This move extends a previous 90-day pause on the import taxes, with the White House indicating the new date could be flexible if countries propose alternative trade arrangements. While the administration argues the tariffs protect US businesses, economists and foreign leaders express concern over their potential to raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, with many analysts viewing the threats as a negotiating tactic.

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been moved from the ICU to a rehabilitation facility three weeks after being shot nine times in his home. He and his wife were attacked in what authorities have described as part of a series of "politically motivated" attacks that also resulted in the deaths of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The alleged shooter, Vance Boelter, is in custody and faces multiple federal and state charges of murder and attempted murder.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly 20-year-old policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes in general security lines at many major airports. The new policy, aimed at speeding up the screening process, is being rolled out with the goal of nationwide implementation. Passengers who trigger alarms at scanners will still need to remove their footwear for additional checks. This marks a significant operational shift from the rule originally enacted in 2006, five years after Richard Reid's failed shoe-bombing attempt on an American Airlines flight.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking gene therapy has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with participants showing significant hearing improvement within weeks. The therapy involves a single injection into the inner ear to deliver a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Researchers from Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet reported that the treatment was safe and particularly effective in younger children, offering hope for future treatments for other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>An 83-year-old woman died in Chatham County, North Carolina, after her vehicle was swept away by floodwaters from the remnants of Tropical Depression Chantal. The storm system brought heavy rain across the state, causing widespread flash flooding, prompting dozens of water rescues, and leaving thousands of residents without power. The storm is now moving northeast over Virginia, with flood watches remaining in effect for several mid-Atlantic states as the system continues to produce heavy rainfall and dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its previously considered plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have cut tens of thousands of jobs. The VA stated that staff reductions achieved through a hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition have eliminated the need for mass layoffs. The department is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year, a smaller number than the up to 80,000 jobs initially at risk under the plan.</p>

          <p>China has activated a new civilian flight path, W121, near the median line of the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, drawing concern from Taiwanese officials. This is the last of three branch routes off the main M503 path, which at its closest point is only 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial dividing line. Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration stated the move was a technical adjustment to ease air traffic congestion, but Taipei views such unilateral actions as a potential security and aviation safety risk.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that investigators found no credible evidence of a "client list" or of him blackmailing prominent individuals. The memo, released to address widespread speculation, states that a systematic review of all evidence confirmed Epstein's cause of death and did not uncover information that could predicate new investigations against uncharged parties. This official conclusion aims to put an end to the numerous conspiracy theories surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th career All-Star team as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his significant career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the veteran pitcher, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that while his performance this year might not typically warrant a selection, he is excited to enjoy the experience.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a $2.2 billion plan to acquire 36 more AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, citing their vulnerability in modern warfare. A South Korean lawmaker explained that lessons from the war in Ukraine, which have shown the effectiveness of drones and advanced air defenses against helicopters, prompted the decision. The funds will instead be redirected toward investing in future-focused capabilities like drones and smart systems, reflecting a strategic shift away from expensive legacy platforms.

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not press charges against the thousands of people who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, even though the event had been officially banned by the government. The decision was made because organizers, including Budapest's mayor, had declared the march an official municipal event, creating a legal gray area and leading participants to believe it was lawful. This development occurred despite the Hungarian government's right-wing populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, describing the event as "repulsive and shameful."</p>
