          <p>Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old American-Israeli hostage, was released by Hamas after being held captive since October 7, 2023, following negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas. The International Committee of the Red Cross facilitated his transfer from Gaza to Israeli authorities, and he has since spoken with his mother and arrived at a reception point in southern Israel for medical assessment and family reunion. The article notes that Israeli security officials implemented a temporary pause in combat in the area of Gaza where Alexander was released to ensure his safe passage into Israeli territory, and that his release is viewed as a goodwill gesture toward the Trump administration and a potential opening for broader conflict resolution talks.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department spent over $21 million on 46 flights to Guantanamo Bay between January 20 and April 8 in support of migrant deportation flights, according to data sent to Congress. These flights, totaling 802 hours, averaged $26,277 per flight hour. In January, President Trump directed his administration to use Guantanamo Bay as a holding site for migrants, prioritizing "worst" offenders as part of his immigration crackdown. The administration has transferred Venezuelan migrants to the facility before taking them to Honduras, and has intermittently brought migrants to the base before transferring them elsewhere in the proceeding months.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego introduced a border security and immigration reform plan that has garnered immediate support from several House Democrats. Gallego's "five-pillar" framework combines Republican priorities, such as increasing Border Patrol staffing, with Democratic goals like creating a "pathway to citizenship" for select migrants, particularly for economic benefit. The plan also seeks to reform the asylum process by expediting claims, enforcing fair resettlement shares among countries, and combating cartel violence, while increasing the annual green card quota and expanding the use of e-Verify.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to lower U.S. drug prices by forcing drug companies to match the lower prices paid in other developed countries. If drugmakers don't comply voluntarily, the administration threatens to directly tie drug prices paid by government programs like Medicare to those in other countries. The order directs the U.S. Trade Representative and Department of Commerce to take action against policies that lower drug prices abroad and seeks to facilitate direct-to-consumer sales bypassing insurance at lower prices. The executive order lays out multiple approaches to lower prices.</p>

          <p>A trade agreement between the U.S. and China has resulted in temporarily reduced tariffs between the two countries, causing a surge in the stock market. The U.S. has agreed to cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China committed to reducing tariffs on U.S. products from 125% to 10%. These lowered tariffs will remain in place for 90 days while the two sides negotiate a wider trade deal. The framework established a mechanism for negotiations between senior officials from both countries, but key sticking points remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has ordered stricter border controls to curb irregular immigration, including turning away non-EU citizens without a visa and asylum seekers who have already applied in another EU country. The new policy is based on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's election pledge to tighten border controls and aims to prevent migrants from reaching Germany and motivate EU neighbors to stop migrants from passing through. The measures are legally controversial, with left-wing politicians criticizing the rejections as a breach of European law, while the far-right AfD believes the country should close itself off even more.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has unveiled its long-awaited plans to cut immigration levels into the UK, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer outlining measures to make the system "controlled, selective, and fair." The plans include tightening work visa requirements by generally requiring a degree-level qualification, extending residency waits for indefinite stay applications to 10 years, and scrapping the dedicated visa for social care workers. At the same time, the government aims to expand eligibility for its dedicated work visa for graduates of elite universities outside the UK and review the visa for international students planning to start a business in the UK.</p>

Trump said the lower rate will last 90 days with the expectation of a broader agreement with China. The President claimed he had taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, which is false, as U.S. tariffs are collected by U.S. Customs from American importers.</p>
