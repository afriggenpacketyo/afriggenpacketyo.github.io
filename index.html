          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium aiming to keep TikTok operational in the U.S. under a potential framework deal between the U.S. and China. The precise structure remains unclear, including the level of involvement from ByteDance and control over TikTok's algorithm, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to discuss terms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed commercial terms are agreed upon, while China's vice minister of commerce vowed to protect Chinese enterprises.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are exploring the possibility of using Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher in the playoffs, despite his primary role as a starter. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman confirmed Ohtani will start, but left open scenarios for bullpen appearances, citing past examples like Walker Buehler. However, MLB's two-way rules complicate this, as using Ohtani as a reliever would mean losing him as a designated hitter once he exits the mound. The team is weighing these complex logistical and strategic challenges as the regular season concludes.</p>

          <p>University of California President James B. Milliken warned that the federal government's $1.2 billion fine and proposed overhaul of UCLA are just a prelude to wider investigations across all 10 UC campuses and health systems. These actions, stemming from Trump administration allegations of illegal race-based admissions and civil rights complaints, could lead to significant federal funding cuts and layoffs. UC leaders are negotiating, refusing the fine, while faculty groups have filed a lawsuit to compel the university to release the government's settlement proposal, citing transparency and public interest.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have agreed on a "framework" deal for TikTok, with commercial terms settled between private parties. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are scheduled to discuss and finalize the terms on Friday. This framework could potentially shift TikTok to U.S.-controlled ownership, addressing concerns about its "foreign adversary-controlled application" status. The agreement comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest or be banned in the U.S., a deadline that may require a brief extension.</p>

          <p>Simon Leviev, known as the "Tinder Swindler" from a popular Netflix documentary, has been arrested in Georgia at Interpol's request. The Israeli con artist, whose real name is Shimon Yehuda Hayut, gained notoriety for allegedly swindling women out of an estimated $10 million by posing as a wealthy diamond mogul on Tinder. He was previously convicted of fraud in 2019 and served five months of a 15-month sentence. The specific charges for his current arrest were not immediately detailed by authorities.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, reportedly confessed to the shooting in messages to friends on Discord hours before his arrest. An account allegedly belonging to Robinson posted, "It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this." Discord confirmed the messages but found no evidence of planning or promoting violence on the platform. Law enforcement sources indicate Robinson also joked about a manifesto and rifle with friends, and later suggested he would surrender.</p>

          <p>Two 17-year-old teenagers in China have been ordered by a Shanghai court to pay 2.2 million yuan ($309,000) to two catering companies after they urinated in a hotpot broth and posted a video online. The incident at a Haidilao restaurant caused widespread criticism and reputational damage, though no one consumed the contaminated broth. The court found the teenagers infringed on property rights and reputation, with their parents held responsible for failing their guardianship duties. However, additional compensation Haidilao offered to customers was deemed a voluntary business decision.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump cannot fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before the central bank's policy committee meets to decide on interest rates. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump's emergency request to pause a lower-court ruling, affirming that Cook can participate in the pivotal meeting. Trump had sought to remove Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, citing mortgage fraud allegations she denies. This decision protects the Fed's independence against presidential pressure, with two Biden-appointed judges siding against Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is considering removing "black box" warnings from certain menopause hormone therapies, prompting a debate over their benefits and risks. Flawed 2002 research had overstated breast cancer risks by focusing on older women, but newer studies suggest treatment timing and delivery methods significantly mitigate these concerns. Dr. Mary Rosser advocates for hormone therapy as effective for perimenopausal symptoms, while a group of 76 doctors calls for more scientific assessment before changes.
