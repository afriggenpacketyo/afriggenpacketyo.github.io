          <p>Israeli strikes in northern Gaza have reportedly killed at least 50 Palestinians, including children and women, according to a local hospital. The strikes targeted homes in the Jabalia area, following warnings from the Israeli military about rocket launches into Israel by a Palestinian armed group. The UN's humanitarian affairs chief has urged the UN Security Council to take action to prevent genocide in Gaza, criticizing Israel's actions and blockade. Amidst the ongoing conflict, there are hopes that Hamas's release of an Israeli-American hostage could lead to a new ceasefire deal. Optimism score is 20.</p>

Syria is in a precarious state as it emerges from civil war and a long dictatorship. The recently announced removal of U.S. sanctions brings hopes that the economy might stabilize. Another challenge is Syria's population— it is one of the most diverse countries in the Middle East and with that comes competing demands and priorities from various groups. The report delves into their unique religious beliefs, including reincarnation, and their role in the country's diverse social fabric.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering prescription drug prices in the U.S., where costs are significantly higher than in other high-income countries. The article explains that the lack of universal healthcare and the role of Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) contribute to high drug prices. While the executive order aims to address this, its effectiveness is uncertain, with past efforts facing legal challenges. Experts suggest that congressional action is needed to truly change how drug prices are negotiated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With inflation declining and interest rate cuts anticipated, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is becoming an attractive option for homeowners. The average HELOC rate is currently at 7.99%, making it a cheaper borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. Elevated home equity levels also contribute to the appeal of HELOCs, allowing homeowners to utilize their equity for various expenses. However, borrowers should exercise caution and calculate potential payments under different interest rate scenarios to ensure affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

Disagreements stem from different interpretations of CBO analyses and whether proposed policies are included in Republican legislation.

          <p>California is facing an additional $12 billion state budget shortfall next year, which Gov. Gavin Newsom attributes to overspending and President Trump’s federal tariff policy. Newsom unveiled a revised spending plan that proposes cuts to free healthcare for undocumented immigrants, Medi-Cal benefits for weight loss treatments, and overtime hours for in-home support service workers. The new deficit comes in addition to $27.3 billion in fiscal remedies already agreed upon, marking the third year in a row that Newsom and lawmakers have been forced to reduce funding for state programs.</p>

          <p>Chris Smith was shot in the head on Thanksgiving afternoon in 2021. He was found by emergency medical technician Dennis Hobson. Smith had a gunshot wound to the head and a woman, later identified as Leslie Reeves from nearby Troy, Illinois, was lying dead on the living room floor with a single bullet wound to her head, according to a sheriff's report. Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix, was huddled with her owner Chris Smith, providing much needed warmth in the 12 hours before he was rescued after the shooting.</p>

          <p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar is set to give a speech on the rule of law and what she paints as President Trump's overreach on Wednesday night, as Democrats look to find effective messaging that will resonate with voters about the early days of the Republican's second term in the White House. Excerpts obtained by CBS News ahead of the event hosted by The New Republic show Klobuchar plans to make the case that "Donald Trump is trying to remake the executive office into one that is immune from outside accountability."</p>
