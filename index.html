          <h2>Denmark Lowers 2025 Economic Growth Projection Due to Pharmaceutical Sector Slowdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 03:42:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has significantly reduced its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, primarily due to revised expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited a notable fall in U.S. exports in early 2025, following a late 2024 spike, alongside increased competition in the weight loss drug market and the impact of generic medicines. Additionally, the threat of U.S. tariffs on Europe's pharmaceutical sector, despite a recent EU-U.S. trade deal, also contributed to the lowered projection. Despite this adjustment, the ministry stressed the economy's underlying strength, with high employment and inflation expected to remain below 2% annually, while revising its 2026 growth forecast upward to 2.1%.

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox News, Fox Sports, and other Fox channels will remain available on YouTube TV. This resolution follows a period of intense negotiations where YouTube, owned by Alphabet, had stated Fox was demanding significantly higher payments. A short-term extension had previously averted a potential blackout for millions of subscribers. The undisclosed financial terms of the deal prevent disruptions to major sporting events like a highly anticipated college football match and the start of the National Football League season. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr expressed satisfaction with the outcome, highlighting the positive impact for sports fans and avoiding blackouts.</p>

          <p>Starting January next year, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect youngsters from severe complications and reduce the estimated £24m annual loss in income and productivity due to the illness. Health Minister Stephen Kinnock emphasized empowering parents to protect their children, while experts noted the UK has lagged behind other countries like the US in offering the jab. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended this introduction in November 2023, expecting a dramatic reduction in cases.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour MSP Colin Smyth has had his Holyrood pass deactivated amid reports alleging he placed a camera in a Scottish Parliament toilet. Smyth was previously suspended by Labour after being charged with possessing indecent images of children earlier this month, and is now reportedly facing a further police charge concerning the camera. The parliament's chief executive, David McGill, informed members of the pass deactivation due to the ongoing criminal investigation, emphasizing available support services for staff. The Scottish Labour Party confirmed swift action was taken upon learning of the serious allegations, reiterating that Smyth is an independent MSP and they cannot comment further during legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>The UK government proceeded with the largest reorganization of English councils in decades without conducting its own analysis of the costs, instead relying on a 2020 report.

However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now indicating that the reorganization could yield no savings or even incur costs, especially with proposals for multiple smaller unitary councils. Critics argue this oversight could strain public services further, emphasizing the need for new councils to be appropriately sized for efficiency.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley reflected on his US Open second-round loss to Alexander Zverev, highlighting the mind games employed by the third seed, who kept him waiting over 10 minutes. Despite the straight-sets defeat, Fearnley gained valuable experience, acknowledging Zverev's consistency and dominant serving, which ground him down over two and a half hours. The 24-year-old, just 14 months into his professional career, admitted to fluctuating performance and missed opportunities to capitalize on chances. He also recognized the need to improve his serve, having struck 12 double faults against Zverev, including on crucial points, an issue he is actively working to overcome.</p>

The Netherlands international is currently in England, with sources indicating he has completed his medical examination ahead of signing with Thomas Frank's side. An agreement in principle has been reached between the clubs, with the final details expected to be concluded within the next 24 hours. This potential transfer would see Simons join Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus as new summer arrivals at Spurs, following their earlier unsuccessful bids for Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze, who joined rivals Arsenal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has determined that Denver Public Schools violated Title IX by implementing all-gender bathrooms and allowing students to use facilities based on gender identity rather than biological sex. The investigation, initiated after a complaint about East High School, concluded that these policies create a hostile environment by endangering student safety, privacy, and dignity. The Trump administration has issued a proposed resolution requiring the district to revert to sex-designated multi-stall restrooms, abandon gender identity-based bathroom policies, and adopt biology-based definitions for "male" and "female" in Title IX related practices. The department emphasized that accepting federal funds necessitates compliance with Title IX's prohibition of sex-based discrimination.</p>

          <p>Famous Australian crocodile wrangler Matt Wright has been found guilty on two counts of perverting the course of justice, including lying to police and pressuring a hospitalized witness. The charges stem from a fatal helicopter crash in 2022 that killed his friend and co-star, Chris "Willow" Wilson, during a crocodile egg harvesting operation. Prosecutors argued Wright tampered with evidence, fearing blame for the crash, which an investigation found occurred because the helicopter ran out of fuel due to the pilot not identifying a reducing fuel state. Wright, who denies the charges, plans to appeal the verdict delivered on his 46th birthday.</p>

This change, effective Friday, is creating a "chaotic mess" for small businesses, many of whom have paused U.S. shipments due to unclear costs and logistical challenges.

          <p>West Mercia Police are investigating a new report of child sexual assault at Berrow Wood School, a reform school notorious for abuse between 1968 and 1991. This fresh report concerns at least 14 former staff members, some of whom are believed to be still alive, adding to the nine previous convictions of teachers and workers for physically and sexually assaulting pupils. Survivors, many of whom were vulnerable boys sent by local authorities, describe enduring trauma and a profound lack of accountability from the government. They criticize the government's decision not to proceed with a recommended redress scheme for survivors, highlighting the ongoing impact of these horrific historic experiences.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, plans its first test launch of the Soyuz-5 rocket by December, aiming for full operational status by 2028. This medium-class launch vehicle, equipped with powerful RD-171MV engines, is seen as a reincarnation of the Ukraine-manufactured Zenit-2 rocket. The ambitious deadline comes as Roscosmos faces significant funding shortages, having lost 180 billion rubles ($2.24 billion) since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and is selling non-core assets to support its activities. The agency's space sector has been heavily impacted by severed ties with the European Space Agency, prompting a shift to launching Soyuz-5 from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome.

This engaging feature playfully addresses Britain's national inclination to complain about the weather, inviting users to determine if their location truly experiences less sunshine or if it is, in fact, a "green and pleasant land." The tool provides a novel and accessible way for individuals to assess their forecast relative to global conditions, encouraging a broader perspective on climate. Users can access the latest forecast on the BBC Weather website, with the potential to gain insights that could make them the BBC's next star meteorologist.</p>

          <p>The White House has named Jim O'Neill, deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This appointment follows the contentious removal of Susan Monarez, who served only a month after her Senate confirmation, with the White House citing her lack of alignment with the president's agenda. Monarez's lawyers contend her sacking was illegal, alleging she was targeted for refusing to "rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives." The change comes amid resignations of other senior CDC officials, some citing frustration over vaccine policies and Kennedy's leadership, raising concerns about the agency's scientific independence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. tariff exemption for global package shipments valued under $800, known as the "de minimis" rule, officially ended on Friday, signaling a permanent change by the Trump administration. This move, which broadens an earlier cancellation for China and Hong Kong, will impose normal duty rates on all global parcel imports, disrupting supply chains and raising costs. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stated the change would save American lives by restricting illicit goods like fentanyl and add up to $10 billion annually in tariff revenues. A six-month transition period allows postal services to pay flat duties before shifting to full "ad valorem" duty collection by February 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region are commemorating the 20-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which struck on August 29, 2005. This historic storm, which remains the costliest in U.S. history at approximately $200 billion in today's dollars, resulted in nearly 1,400 deaths. The devastation was particularly severe in the Lower 9th Ward, a predominantly Black community with a high rate of multi-generational homeownership, where multiple levee breaches led to widespread inundation and destruction of thousands of homes. The anniversary serves as a poignant reminder of the profound loss and the subsequent two decades of determined rebuilding and resilience by the affected communities.</p>

This potential sighting follows a plea from Phillips’ relatives for him to return home. Police believe Phillips and his children are living off-grid, using his survival skills, and potentially receiving support, though the break-in could indicate a change in his circumstances.

          <p>Elderly Chinese survivors, often referred to as 'comfort women,' are still awaiting court action on landmark lawsuits filed against the Japanese government, demanding formal apologies and compensation. Two groups, totaling eight survivors from Shanxi and Hunan provinces, now averaging 96 years old, filed similar lawsuits seeking 2 million yuan (US$276,000) for each victim. Despite the historic significance, provincial high courts have not responded or provided a timeline for taking up these cases, nor have they dismissed them. For these plaintiffs, the fight is not merely for restitution but for official recognition of their immense suffering before time runs out for the rapidly dwindling group of survivors.</p>

Officials confirmed Westman, who died by self-inflicted gunshot, had previously attended the church's school.
