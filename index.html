        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Transportation is officially dropping a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to offer cash payments to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airline industry groups who argued it would increase ticket prices and create operational burdens. The DOT stated it will now reconsider such extra-statutory requirements while still committing to enforcing consumer protection laws mandated by Congress, such as refunds for canceled flights when passengers choose not to travel. This decision is seen as a move toward deregulation favored by the current administration.</p>

          <p>Two recent studies highlight potential negative mental health outcomes associated with using cannabis to manage stress, anxiety, or trauma. Research published in BMJ Mental Health found that individuals who began using marijuana for coping purposes were significantly more likely to experience paranoia later on, compared to those who used it for recreational reasons. A second study in Psychological Medicine indicated that cannabis can exacerbate the effects of childhood trauma on paranoia. Experts warn that as legalization expands, self-medicating with increasingly potent cannabis products may backfire, and they urge caution and further research into its long-term psychological effects.</p>

          <p>Endico Potatoes Inc. has issued a recall for 2.5 lb bags of its frozen peas and carrots, as well as its mixed vegetables, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The affected products were distributed in seven eastern markets, including New York, New Jersey, and Florida, between July and August 2025. The recall was initiated after routine sampling at a distributor in Pennsylvania tested positive for the bacteria. While no illnesses have been reported, listeria can cause serious infections, particularly in vulnerable populations, and the FDA advises consumers to return the products for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are remembering Giorgio Armani not just for his iconic designs but as a brilliant business leader who built a global empire by maintaining strict control over his brand. Armani revolutionized fashion by creating accessible luxury, from red-carpet gowns to everyday apparel and even home goods, all while upholding a consistent vision of sophisticated elegance. He famously pioneered the "power suit" for both men and women and was among the first to strategically use celebrity endorsements to elevate his brand's profile. By never selling his company, he retained full creative and financial control, a rarity in the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, which alleged that Fox engaged in monopolistic practices to suppress conservative media competitors. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled the suit was an improper "shotgun complaint" because it incorporated all allegations from the first count into subsequent counts, a technical violation of legal procedure. However, the dismissal is without prejudice, and the judge has granted Newsmax a short deadline to file an amended complaint that adheres to proper formatting. Newsmax has stated its intention to refile the case, indicating the legal battle between the rival networks is likely to continue.</p>

          <p>Kenvue, the parent company of Tylenol, saw its stock price fall sharply following a Wall Street Journal report that the Department of Health and Human Services is preparing to release findings potentially linking the painkiller's use during pregnancy to autism. The report, expected this month and spearheaded by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has raised significant investor concern. Kenvue issued a statement maintaining that there is no causal link and that the FDA and other medical bodies affirm the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy. This development is part of a broader shift in federal health policy under Kennedy, who has focused on investigating the causes of autism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 22,000 jobs in August, far below expectations, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%, signaling a sharp slowdown in the labor market. The report also included a significant downward revision for June, which now shows a loss of 13,000 jobs—the first monthly decline since 2020. This cooling trend, combined with rising inflation from trade tariffs, creates a complex picture for the economy and increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The data also highlighted a widening racial disparity, with the unemployment rate for Black Americans jumping to 7.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online activities, such as shopping or browsing property sites, does not constitute a sackable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage. The ruling noted that the employee's personal browsing was not excessive, the company had no clear policy against it, and even the boss engaged in similar activities. The judge concluded the real motive for the dismissal was likely to replace the employee before she reached two years of service.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial advice article addresses how an individual in a community-property state like Arizona can protect an inheritance from being divided in a potential future divorce. The key strategy is to prevent commingling the inherited funds with marital assets. This involves opening a separate brokerage account solely in the recipient's name rather than depositing the money into joint accounts or certain shared retirement funds like a 401(k), where appreciation during the marriage could be considered community property. Keeping the inheritance distinctly separate ensures it legally remains the individual's personal property, safeguarding it from potential claims. (not investment advice)</p>

The original name change in 1947 was part of a broader post-WWII restructuring intended to unify the armed forces and shift focus toward deterring conflict in the nuclear age.

Options include moving the funds to a high-yield savings account, which offers comparable rates with greater flexibility, or a money market account that combines high interest with checking features. Alternatively, investing in a new long-term CD can lock in a fixed rate for several years, providing security against further market declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Broadcom soared after the company reported strong quarterly earnings and an even stronger forecast, fueled by booming demand for its artificial intelligence products. CEO Hock Tan announced that Broadcom has secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips and now has a backlog exceeding $110 billion. This unexpected growth means that Wall Street's future earnings estimates are rising significantly. As a result, even as the stock price hits all-time highs, its price-to-earnings valuation has not become more expensive, a dynamic that suggests continued investor confidence.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has appointed David Lammy as the new deputy prime minister following the resignation of Angela Rayner. Rayner stepped down from her cabinet role and as deputy leader of the Labour Party after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a property sale. The move is part of a broader cabinet reshuffle by Starmer to fill the key leadership position and adjust other ministerial roles within his government. Lammy's appointment places him in one of the most senior positions in the UK government, second only to the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to an estimated $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, sparking a nationwide lottery frenzy that is significantly benefiting gambling company DraftKings. The company's lottery courier app, Jackpocket, has seen a massive surge in ticket orders, with sales increasing 130% in a single day this week. This high-volume engagement provides a major boost for DraftKings, which acquired Jackpocket in 2024 with the strategic goal of cross-selling lottery players to its core sports betting and iGaming products.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly, dropping to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This marks the largest one-day decrease in over a year and brings rates to their lowest point since October of the previous year. The cooling labor market has led investors to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in cutting interest rates, causing bond yields and mortgage rates to fall.

Noem had complained that the show "shamefully edited" her recent appearance, cutting remarks she made about an individual involved in a deportation case that were potentially defamatory. The new policy dictates that interviews will either be broadcast live or "live to tape," meaning they are recorded in one take and aired without edits.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration is encouraging a Texas oil company to restart the same pipelines responsible for the devastating 2015 Refugio State Beach oil spill. The author contends this move is an act of political vengeance against California that prioritizes corporate interests over environmental safety, ignoring warnings from state agencies that the decade-old, corroded pipelines pose a significant threat. The piece calls for public mobilization to oppose the restart, warning that another spill could be even larger and more destructive than the last, and that the administration cannot be trusted to help in a crisis.</p>

          <p>A political analysis examines the potential consequences for President Trump as the Jeffrey Epstein scandal continues to unfold. One scenario suggests that continued pressure from victims and bipartisan congressional efforts to release all government files could lead to politically damaging revelations, increasing the heat on the administration. Another possibility is that while the story rumbles on, it fails to produce a "smoking gun," becoming a persistent distraction rather than a major crisis. A final scenario posits that, like past controversies, Trump's ability to weather scandals will allow the story to eventually fade from mainstream attention without causing lasting political harm.</p>
