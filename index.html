          <p>Iran has criticized the United States' imposition of a travel ban affecting Iranian citizens and nationals from eleven other predominantly Middle Eastern and African countries, which is scheduled to take effect on June 9. An Iranian Foreign Ministry official, Alireza Hashemi-Raja, described the policy as indicative of a supremacist and racist mentality among American policymakers, further asserting that the ban violates international law by depriving millions of their right to travel based on nationality or religion. This action underscores the strained relations between Iran and the U.S., which severed diplomatic ties following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The US is home to the largest Iranian community outside of Iran.</p>

          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was notably absent from the England squad facing Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, alongside Conor Gallagher and Ollie Watkins, the latter due to a minor injury. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting a link between his omission and his fitness. Saka, 23, has yet to play under Tuchel, having missed the German's first camp due to injury, and it remains uncertain whether he will participate in the friendly against Senegal on June 10. England remains unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won their first two matches against Latvia and Albania.</p>

The South China Sea Probing Initiative (SCSPI) reported that Vietnam has reclaimed nearly 0.78 sq km of land on 11 features in the Spratly Islands in the past six months. In total, Vietnam has reclaimed over 8.5 sq km of new land on these features since October 2021, also stepping up construction of military-related facilities. Vietnam is reportedly building an airstrip on Barque Canada Reef expected to be about 3,000 meters long upon completion.</p>

          <p>The UK government is struggling to reduce the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with the Home Office planning to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25, with the money largely used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers. The Home Office said it is committed to ending asylum hotels and speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money, but international charities have criticized the diversion of aid from humanitarian and development priorities overseas. The government's reductions to the overall ODA budget have exacerbated these cuts, prompting concerns about the UK's international reputation.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is reportedly "livid" due to a potential shortage of pheasants at Sandringham Estate, which may affect the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a cherished royal family holiday pastime. The shortage is attributed to the king's preference for maintaining the estate’s game population rather than importing birds, an eco-friendly approach that has seemingly failed. Some experts suggest the change in plans could allow the king to prioritize reconciliation with Prince Harry, while others note the king's willingness to adapt, citing his unconventional Christmas speech location. The tradition has faced criticism from animal rights groups, potentially prompting a review.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is increasingly concerned about China's growing military presence in Africa, particularly the training of African military officers, according to General Michael Langley, head of US Africa Command (AFRICOM). Langley warned that China is replicating US training programs, such as the International Military Education and Training (IMET). This concern arises as the US shifts its approach from providing military aid to encouraging African countries to become self-reliant. China has become a major supplier of military equipment, particularly in the Sahel region, as junta-led leaders distance themselves from Western partners.</p>

The raids resulted in 44 administrative arrests and one arrest for obstruction, as federal agents executed search warrants related to harboring individuals without legal residency. Protests erupted, with hundreds gathering to demand the release of those detained, including SEIU California President David Huerta, who was injured and arrested while documenting a raid. Elected officials condemned the raids, while federal authorities defended their actions, leading to heightened tensions and community fear.</p>

          <h2>Iran Criticizes Trump's Travel Ban as Racist and Hostile to Muslims</h2>

          <p>Tehran has denounced the US travel ban on Iranians and citizens of 11 other mostly Middle Eastern and African countries, calling it a sign of a "racist mentality." Donald Trump's executive order revived sweeping restrictions justified on national security grounds after a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado. Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the foreign ministry’s director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, said the measure – which takes effect on 9 June – "indicates the deep hostility of American decision-makers towards the Iranian and Muslim people." The decision violates fundamental principles of international law and deprives hundreds of millions of people of the right to travel based solely on their nationality or religion.</p>

          <p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez, a global businessman and ambassador of a London polo club, led a double life as "one of the world's most prolific drug traffickers," according to US officials. While outwardly appearing as an upstanding individual, Hafeez supplied tonnes of heroin, methamphetamine, and hashish from Pakistan and India, using his position to inform on rival cartels. After a joint British and American operation, Hafeez was extradited from the UK in 2023 and sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs into the US. The BBC uncovered details from court documents and interviews revealing how he managed to stay under the radar for so long.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has voiced his concern about his form heading into the US Open after missing the cut at the Canadian Open due to struggles with his driver. McIlroy, who shot an eight-over-par 78 during his second round, found just 13 of 28 fairways in Toronto, and he made a quadruple-bogey eight on the par-four fifth hole after a disastrous tee-off. His previous driver was ruled non-conforming on the eve of last month's US PGA Championship, and he is now searching for the missing piece off the tee. He acknowledged that hitting fairways is crucial for success at Oakmont, the venue for the US Open.</p>

He appeared in federal court in Nashville, with his arraignment set for June 13. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in smuggling undocumented migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and other countries into the US. His lawyer argues that the Trump administration returned him to the US not to correct their error but to prosecute him, calling it an abuse of power.</p>

Lee's election follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and is anticipated to bring potential changes in Seoul's foreign policy towards the US, Japan, China, and North Korea. While Lee is regarded as more friendly towards China and North Korea, continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan is also expected. During his 2022 campaign, Lee faced criticism for describing US Forces Korea (USFK) as “occupation forces”.</p>
