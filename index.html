          <p>Liverpool has reportedly accepted a fee from Real Madrid to release Trent Alexander-Arnold early from his contract, allowing the 26-year-old England right-back to join the Spanish club on June 1. The transfer fee is rumored to be around 10 million euros, although sources differ on the exact amount. Alexander-Arnold has agreed to a six-year deal with Real Madrid, which includes a 1 billion euro buy-out clause, and is expected to participate in the Club World Cup. In a related move, Liverpool has completed the signing of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen for 35 million euros.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are seeking strategies to manage their finances amidst high borrowing costs. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt, as the average credit card APR hovers around 20%, and exploring options like zero-interest balance transfer cards or low-interest personal loans. Locking in high-yield savings rates is also advised, as rates on online savings accounts and money market accounts will likely decrease once the Fed lowers rates. Improving credit scores can also help individuals qualify for lower interest rates on loans. (not investment advice)</p>

Factors to consider include personal budget, economic outlook, and potential changes in interest rates.

He emphasized France's friendship with both the United States and China, advocating for a balanced approach that protects its own interests. Macron's remarks come amidst a regional tour aimed at bolstering France's defense cooperation with other nations.</p>

          <p>The last hospital providing health services in the North Gaza governorate, al-Awda hospital, has been evacuated after the Israeli military ordered its immediate closure. The hospital's director stated that the Israeli forces threatened to bomb the hospital if it was not evacuated, prompting the staff to move patients to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that the closure of al-Awda means there are no remaining functioning hospitals in the North Gaza governorate, severing a critical lifeline for the people there. The IDF had ordered evacuations of several areas, stating that they will expand offensive activity to destroy terrorist capabilities.</p>

          <p>A ban on single-use vapes is set to take effect in the UK on Sunday to curb youth vaping rates and reduce electronic waste, but a campaign group warns that this measure may not significantly reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to teenagers. According to Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), new reusable vapes are very similar to single-use vapes, making it unlikely that the ban will have a substantial impact. The government has stated that the ban would "reduce the appeal of vapes to children", but Ash argues that stronger action is needed to make vaping less appealing to young people.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Golden Dome missile defense program, which aims to create space-based weapons to intercept strikes against the US, is not expected to be fully operational before the end of his term. The implementation plan envisions having the defense weapons ready only for a demonstration by the end of 2028. The Pentagon plans to focus initially on integrating data systems before developing space-based weapons. The space-based network is likely to rely heavily on Elon Musk's SpaceX, but the flagship concept to identify and kill ballistic missiles in the early "boost phase" is not expected to be ready for years.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, attributing it to redefined standards of parenting and expanded definitions of harm and trauma. The author argues that millennials face immense pressure to not only provide basic needs but also ensure their children's career success and mental well-being. This heightened expectation creates a daunting prospect, contributing to the declining fertility rate and the trend of millennials choosing to remain childless. The author suggests that this cultural shift has made parenting seem almost impossible to achieve successfully.</p>
