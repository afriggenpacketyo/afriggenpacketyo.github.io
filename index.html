          <p>Shares of Canada Goose experienced a significant surge of approximately 20% following the release of their fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, which surpassed analysts' estimates. Despite this positive outcome, the company has chosen to withdraw its fiscal 2026 outlook, citing prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties. The luxury retailer emphasized its confidence in the brand's resilience and financial stability, highlighting its ability to adapt to evolving market conditions, with approximately 75% of Canada Goose units being manufactured in Canada and largely compliant with US trade agreements, thus minimizing the impact of tariffs. The company is focusing on product category expansion to strengthen year-round relevance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is moving to end police reform agreements with Louisville and Minneapolis that were initiated after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. These agreements, which aimed to address systemic unconstitutional policing, have faced delays in federal court. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated the DOJ is ending the 'failed experiment' of consent decrees, which she argues divest local control and hand it to unaccountable bureaucrats. Officials in both cities have expressed commitment to continuing reforms regardless of federal support, but proponents of consent decrees argue federal oversight is crucial for lasting change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tax cuts promoted by the Trump administration are intensifying concerns about debt and deficits among bond investors, which could influence interest rates. These investors were already uneasy due to Trump's tariff policies, and the proposed tax cuts without significant spending reductions have heightened market turmoil. The rise in Treasury yields, particularly the 10-year and 30-year yields, reflects these deficit worries. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic cautioned that volatility in the Treasury market could increase economic uncertainty, with some investors remaining skeptical unless substantial changes are made to the tax bill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent inflation surprise, with the rate reaching 3.5% in the 12 months to April, suggests the economic outlook may be less positive than previously thought. Higher energy and water bills, along with rising food and service prices, contributed to this increase, exceeding inflation rates in France and Germany. While some factors, like airfare spikes due to late Easter holidays, are temporary, persistent price pressures in services, such as restaurant meals, remain a concern. Economists anticipate inflation could inch up further in the coming months, potentially impacting the Bank of England's decisions on interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) indicates that five-day in-office mandates are outdated, highlighting the advantages of telework when leaders embrace strategic culture-building, robust performance tracking, and available regulatory guidance. The report emphasizes that flexibility is a key driver for talent acquisition and retention, with remote work removing geographic barriers and increasing employment among workers with disabilities. Telework also delivers cost savings and measurable productivity gains, but building a cohesive culture in distributed teams requires intentional effort and clear communication protocols.</p>

          <p>Callable CDs may offer higher interest rates compared to traditional CDs, but they come with the risk of the bank recalling or redeeming the CD before its full term. Experts suggest callable CDs are worth considering if the rate is significantly higher and there's a call protection period. However, if you prefer stability and predictability, traditional CDs or high-yield savings accounts might be more suitable. Investors should carefully compare options to maximize savings while rates remain elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Efforts to conserve jaguars in Sonora, Mexico, are focused on changing the perception of these animals from threats to valuable ecosystem components. The Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) works with ranchers to use motion cameras, paying them for photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats. This program, Viviendo con Felinos, has expanded the protected area for jaguars and helped shift ranchers' attitudes toward coexistence with these predators. The success of this approach bodes well for restoring jaguars to the US, but the border wall remains a significant obstacle.</p>
