          <p>A small plane crash in Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains has resulted in the death of a 13-year-old girl and serious injuries to three of her relatives. The family, identified as being from Boise, Idaho, was discovered after a medical helicopter spotted the wreckage of the Piper PA-28-180 aircraft. The survivors, including the girl's parents and younger brother, were transported to hospitals for treatment. Federal aviation authorities are now investigating the cause of the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman has publicly questioned team owner Jerry Jones's priorities following the trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons. Speaking on "The Rich Eisen Show," Aikman suggested that Jones seems to prioritize keeping the team in the news over winning championships. He referenced Jones's own comments about enjoying the drama and noted that the franchise's valuation and media attention have seemingly become the scoreboard instead of on-field success. Aikman acknowledged Jones's desire to win but pointed to the team's 30-year absence from a Super Bowl as a source of frustration.</p>

          <p>The U.K. Treasury has announced that the Autumn Budget will be delivered on November 26, placing Finance Minister Rachel Reeves under pressure to address the nation's economic challenges. Reeves must navigate self-imposed fiscal rules that require balancing day-to-day spending with tax revenue and reducing national debt. With rising borrowing costs and commitments to increase spending on defense and health, economists predict that tax hikes may be necessary to meet these fiscal targets. The key question remains which taxes will be raised, as the Labour government has pledged not to increase income tax, national insurance, or VAT. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A central witness in the 2019 federal case against Jeffrey Epstein has spoken publicly for the first time, urging for the release of all related investigation files to provide transparency for victims and the public. Identified as Marina Lacerda, she was a key figure whose testimony about years of sexual abuse, starting when she was 14, helped prosecutors build their sex trafficking case against the disgraced financier. Lacerda described Epstein's New York home as a "revolving door" for young girls and is now advocating alongside other survivors for access to their files to aid in their healing process. Her plea comes amid ongoing scrutiny over the handling of materials related to the case.</p>

          <p>A new documentary podcast details the ordeal of former NFL quarterback Erik Kramer, who survived a suicide attempt in 2015 only to be financially exploited by a woman he secretly married. While recovering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound that left him with diminished mental capacity, Kramer lost approximately $700,000 to Courtney Baird, who took control of his finances. His son attributes his father's struggles, including depression and the suicide attempt, in large part to potential CTE from his football career.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries should step down, labeling their leadership as a record of cowardice and capitulation. The author criticizes their failure to effectively counter the Trump administration and their refusal to endorse their own party's progressive mayoral candidate in New York City. The article points to specific instances of perceived weakness, such as Jeffries questioning his party's leverage and Schumer's feeble responses to Trump's actions. The columnist concludes that this uninspiring leadership is out of touch with the Democratic base and that the current political moment demands more fearless and unrelenting opposition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unusual series of events, federal grand juries in Washington, D.C., have recently rejected at least four indictment requests from the Department of Justice. Former federal prosecutors describe the refusals as exceptionally rare, suggesting a potential loss of credibility between the administration and local jurors. One notable case involved a woman accused of making an online threat against President Trump, while other rejected indictments were for charges like assaulting a federal agent by throwing a sandwich. The rejections highlight the grand jury's role as a constitutional check on prosecutorial power, with some experts speculating that jurors may have disagreed with the DOJ's legal theories or viewed the alleged crimes as not warranting felony charges.</p>

          <p>China's film market experienced a modest recovery this summer, with box office revenue reaching 11.96 billion yuan (US$5.5 billion), a slight increase of 2.76% year-on-year. However, these figures remain significantly below the record-breaking summer of 2023 and pre-pandemic levels, indicating persistent challenges for the industry. Despite a rapid expansion in the number of cinemas, demand has not kept up, making it difficult for many large-budget films to be profitable. In the first half of the year, only a small fraction of films managed to surpass 100 million yuan at the box office, highlighting the ongoing struggle to attract audiences back in large numbers.</p>

          <p>An ecosystem of right-leaning podcasts and online shows, often termed the "manosphere," which was influential in electing Donald Trump, is now showing signs of fragmentation and disappointment six months into his second term. While some hosts like the Full Send Podcast remain loyal, others, including major figures like Joe Rogan and Andrew Schulz, have become more critical. They have expressed disillusionment with the administration's policies on tariffs, foreign wars, and a perceived lack of transparency regarding the Epstein files. This shift could present a challenge for the Republican Party, as these hosts command a large audience of young, male voters who were a key part of Trump's coalition.</p>

He credits the show's unpredictable panel and teasing dynamic, similar to his previous show "Red Eye," for creating a fun atmosphere that resonates with viewers. By deliberately avoiding the politically charged outrage common on other networks, Gutfeld has captured a large segment of the audience that felt alienated by mainstream culture.</p>

          <p>A historical review of California politics reveals a consistent pattern of extremely wealthy, self-funded candidates failing to win elections for governor or U.S. senator. Over the past 50 years, numerous high-profile figures like Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina have spent vast personal fortunes on their campaigns only to be defeated. Political strategists suggest this trend stems from a voter perception of an "empathy gap," where the ultra-rich are seen as unable to understand the daily lives of average citizens. While wealth provides the advantage of statewide name recognition through expensive advertising, it also creates a burden for candidates to prove they offer substantive solutions beyond their money.</p>

The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel would provide a permanent, safer alternative, but securing funding for the massive project remains a significant hurdle.

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest aerial attacks of the war, firing more than 500 drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight, targeting civilian and energy infrastructure across the country. Ukrainian air defense forces reported downing or suppressing a majority of the projectiles, but impacts were recorded in 14 locations, including the western city of Lviv. The scale of the assault prompted NATO to scramble Polish and allied aircraft as a precautionary measure due to the proximity of the strikes to the Polish border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a demonstrative strike showing Russian President Vladimir Putin's impunity and called for greater international pressure on Russia's war economy.</p>

          <p>Apple's share price saw a significant boost after a federal judge ruled that Google can continue its multi-billion dollar payments to be the default search engine on Apple's devices. While the landmark antitrust case found Google holds an illegal monopoly, the judge's remedies stopped short of banning these crucial payments, which are a major revenue source for Apple's services division. The decision removes a major financial risk for Apple, as the continuation of the deal ensures a steady stream of high-profit income. The ruling does, however, place new restrictions on Google, prohibiting exclusive contracts and limiting revenue-sharing agreements to one year, which may alter future negotiations.

          <p>A portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee has been returned to display in the library at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, reversing a 2022 decision to remove Confederate commemorations. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to restore historical names and monuments, with an Army spokesperson stating, "we honor our history and learn from it - we don't erase it." Critics, including a retired general who served on the commission that recommended the removal, argue that honoring Lee is antithetical to West Point's motto of "Duty, Honor, Country," as he committed treason against the United States to defend a slave republic.</p>

The exhibit features paintings of America's founders and AI-generated videos where historical figures come to life, but critics are concerned about the blurring of history and fiction. For example, one AI video has John Adams quoting a phrase popularized by modern conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. Historians also worry the exhibit narrowly focuses on a few figures while glossing over complex issues and omitting the contributions of marginalized groups, presenting a simplified and potentially misleading version of American history.</p>

While construction on a 119-mile segment is underway, critics have labeled it a "train to nowhere" as it does not yet connect to Los Angeles or San Francisco.
