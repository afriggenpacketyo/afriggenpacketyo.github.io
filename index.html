          <p>Carly Simon has voiced her support for Sabrina Carpenter amidst criticism of Carpenter's album cover for "Man's Best Friend," which depicts Carpenter on her hands and knees with a man appearing to grab her hair. Simon argues that the cover is relatively tame compared to past instances of bold artistic expression in the music industry, citing The Rolling Stones' "Sticky Fingers" as a more sexually suggestive example. Carpenter has faced backlash for the cover, with some finding it uncomfortable or disgusting, while others defended her artistic freedom. Simon also referenced her own controversial 1975 album cover for "Playing Possum," where she posed in a lacy black dress on her knees, noting the reactions it garnered at the time, and this article is about the public's reaction to a controversial piece of art.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned from her position as a government whip due to the government's plans to cut disability benefits. In her resignation letter to the prime minister, Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. She stated that she could not vote for the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, which is scheduled for debate in Parliament on July 1st. The bill aims to tighten the criteria for personal independence payments and cut the sickness-related element of universal credit, amidst government claims that claimant levels are rising unsustainably.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing anti-immigration enforcement protests in Los Angeles, a group of federal ICE agents was denied entry to Dodger Stadium. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization confirmed that the agents were not allowed onto the stadium grounds after requesting access to the parking lots. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the officers' presence was unrelated to the Dodgers, explaining that CBP vehicles were briefly in the parking lot for reasons unconnected to any operation or enforcement. The incident occurred as protests against ICE raids continued in Los Angeles, with demonstrators criticizing the Dodgers for not speaking out against the immigration raids.</p>

          <p>Several airlines have suspended flights between the United States and the Middle East due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. United Airlines has paused its daily flights between Newark Liberty International Airport and Dubai, while American Airlines has temporarily suspended flights between Philadelphia International Airport and Doha, Qatar, until June 22. Delta Air Lines had previously suspended flights between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Tel Aviv, Israel, until August 31, and Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel remains closed. The flight suspensions come amid escalating tensions, with Israel launching "Operation Rising Lion" against Iran, leading to airspace closures and travel advisories from the U.S. State Department.</p>

While attack plans have been approved, a final decision is pending, contingent on potential negotiations with Iran to abandon its nuclear program. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated a decision would be made within two weeks, and Trump is reportedly reviewing options including the use of bunker-buster bombs. Diplomatic efforts are underway, with the UK and other nations seeking a resolution, and intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, though the CIA has not confirmed an order to weaponize.</p>

          <p>The film "28 Years Later," a reboot of the zombie franchise, presents a story set nearly three decades after a viral pandemic isolated the British Isles. The plot centers on a community living on Lindisfarne, where a young boy named Spike embarks on a journey to find a medical practitioner for his sick mother. The movie blends philosophical moments with violence, creating a tonally complex experience, and the editing incorporates archival footage and poetry to emphasize themes of struggle and division. The film explores the idea that humanity's natural state is conflict, contrasting it with the idealism of modern society, and this movie explores the balance between good and evil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bag use have significantly reduced plastic bag litter along U.S. shorelines. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, finding that areas with bag regulations saw a 25% to 47% decrease in plastic bag litter compared to unregulated areas. The study, which analyzed data from the Ocean Conservancy's global shoreline cleanup initiatives, indicates that fees on plastic bags are more effective than partial bans in limiting shoreline litter. The findings highlight the effectiveness of these policies in curbing plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments.</p>

          <p>With potential U.S. involvement in strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities under consideration, the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb and the B-2 Spirit bomber have come into focus. The MOP, designed to destroy deeply buried and hardened targets, weighs nearly 30,000 pounds and can penetrate up to 200 feet underground before exploding. The B-2 Spirit, known for its stealth capabilities, is the only aircraft in the U.S. Air Force capable of carrying the MOP, and its ability to evade air defenses makes it suitable for reaching heavily defended targets.

The escalation followed reports of an Iranian missile strike on a hospital in Beersheba, and Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed to undermine the Iranian regime.

The GHF, a U.S. and Israeli-backed private contractor, has faced criticism for its distribution methods, which involve armed contractors and concentrated aid deliveries, forcing people to travel long distances through combat zones.

He noted that Hollywood productions were not sending messages that he could be himself in projects where he could see himself reflected in the roles.
