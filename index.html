        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America has confirmed a significant data breach impacting the majority of its 1.4 million U.S. customers. The incident occurred when a hacker used social engineering techniques to access a third-party cloud system, compromising personally identifiable data of customers, financial professionals, and some employees. While the company's internal networks were not breached, Allianz has notified the FBI and is offering affected individuals 24 months of identity theft protection and credit monitoring services. The investigation is ongoing, and the breach is confined to the U.S. life insurance entity.</p>

          <p>Over two years after Damar Hamlin's on-field cardiac arrest, ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky discussed his decision to pray for the player live on air. Orlovsky admitted to feeling uncomfortable but compelled to act, stating that someone needed to actually pray instead of just offering "thoughts and prayers." He acknowledged that prayer isn't for everyone but reported that the reaction from the public and his employer was overwhelmingly positive. The segment resonated with many viewers, and Hamlin has since made a full recovery, returning to play for the Buffalo Bills.</p>

          <p>Democratic representatives Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia have sent a letter to the representatives of Jeffrey Epstein's estate, requesting a copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for his 50th birthday. The book reportedly contains a letter from Donald Trump, the existence of which Trump denies and is the subject of a defamation lawsuit he filed against the Wall Street Journal. The lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and to a scheduled deposition with Ghislaine Maxwell. They have requested the book by August 10th.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's private visit to his golf resorts in Scotland was met with significant protests in Edinburgh and other cities. Demonstrators criticized his political stances and questioned why Scottish taxpayers should fund security for a private trip, with polls showing a high disapproval rating for him in the country. The protests also highlighted Trump's controversial past association with Jeffrey Epstein. During the visit, Trump is also scheduled to meet with UK and EU leaders to discuss trade, though he has downplayed the significance of these talks.</p>

          <p>The parents of a deceased Marine veteran are suing two funeral homes in Georgia and Pennsylvania for gross negligence and emotional distress. They allege their son's brain was returned to them in an unmarked, leaking cardboard box, which they initially believed contained his personal effects. The biohazardous liquid spilled on them, causing severe trauma and forcing them to dispose of their car. The family's lawyer states the funeral homes failed to follow standard protocols for handling biohazardous materials and have not offered an apology. The Pennsylvania funeral home claims it was unaware of the box's contents.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to review a lawsuit challenging the legality of tariffs imposed by President Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, but that decision was paused pending appeal. The case questions the president's power to unilaterally set tariffs by declaring a national emergency, a power he has used for duties on goods from China, Mexico, and other nations. Legal experts suggest the tariffs are at risk, and a loss for the administration could invalidate numerous recent trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>

After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on the fourth day due to being "a bit stiff and sore," according to an assistant coach. Stokes has a history of injuries, and his absence from the bowling attack is a significant concern for England. India ended the day at 174-2, still trailing by 137 runs, giving them a chance to bat for a draw on the final day.</p>

An estimated 350 to 400 anti-immigration demonstrators, carrying signs like "Stop the invasion," were met by about 150 counter-protesters. The event featured speeches from a lorry and chanting but concluded peacefully with no arrests. An organizer for the anti-immigration group stated their goal was a peaceful demonstration to "shut this place down," clarifying they are not against legal immigration but the current system.</p>

          <p>Clothing brand American Eagle has experienced a notable rise in its stock price after launching a new advertising campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ads feature Sweeney in a series of simple, traditionally alluring poses, a departure from the message-driven marketing common today. Investors are reportedly optimistic that this more direct, product-focused approach will drive a significant increase in sales. The market's positive reaction suggests a potential shift in advertising strategy, rewarding brands that prioritize conventional appeal over ideological messaging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters rejected a bid to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature where an opposition coalition currently holds a majority. Supporters of the recall had criticized the KMT for obstructing key legislation and passing reforms seen as favoring Beijing. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance.</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts agreeing that the right amount depends on the individual. While the FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, personal tolerance, health conditions, and lifestyle are key factors. Some studies link moderate coffee consumption (2-3 cups) to health benefits like healthy aging and improved heart health, while others show risks for those with hypertension. Experts advise people to be mindful of how caffeine affects them, noting symptoms like anxiety or poor sleep, and suggest not replacing meals with coffee.</p>

Following their release in a prisoner swap, detainees described enduring daily beatings, humiliation by guards, unsanitary conditions, and being shot with rubber bullets. Many of the men, including one who had agreed to his deportation to Venezuela, were sent to the prison after being flagged as potential gang members without conviction. Their testimonies provide the first detailed look inside the controversial maximum-security facility.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Varna's reformist mayor, Blagomir Kotsev, on corruption charges has triggered protests in Bulgaria's capital and other cities. Demonstrators believe the arrest is politically motivated and an example of the conservative government weaponizing the justice system against its opponents. Kotsev, a member of the pro-European PP party, unseated the long-dominant GERB party in 2023. Critics, including political scientists, warn that key institutions have been hijacked to serve partisan interests, posing a serious threat to the country's democracy and rule of law.</p>
