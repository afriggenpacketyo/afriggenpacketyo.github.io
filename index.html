          <p>A new social media trend called the ‚ÄúChromebook challenge‚Äù involves students deliberately short-circuiting their school-issued laptops, often recording the smoking devices and sharing the footage on TikTok and Instagram. This dangerous trend has led to damaged computers, scorched floors and desks, interrupted lessons, school evacuations, and even criminal charges for some students. School districts across the country are sending letters to families, pleading with them to intervene, and are imposing fines and suspensions. The article highlights the serious consequences of this prank and the efforts schools are taking to stop it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, who is charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, has requested a judge to dismiss some of the charges against him, arguing that they violate his Second Amendment rights. Routh's defense lawyers claim that his prior felony convictions should not preclude him from owning a firearm, and that the absence of a serial number on the firearm does not remove it from Second Amendment protection. The prosecution argues that the statute prohibiting felons from possessing firearms is still law and that a firearm with an obliterated serial number has no lawful purpose. The article also details arguments regarding witness identification and Routh's mental capacity to pose a threat.</p>

          <p>In Kenya, four individuals were recently convicted of attempting to smuggle ants, highlighting a growing issue of biopiracy and illegal wildlife trade. Some of the ants, like the giant African harvester ant, are highly valued by collectors for their colony-building abilities. The Kenya Wildlife Service views this as a violation of the Nagoya Protocol, emphasizing the ecological importance of even smaller species. The illegal trade in wild animals also poses risks to human health through zoonotic diseases.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, which has been challenged in courts, has now reached the Supreme Court. Trump argues that the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States, is ‚Äúabout slavery‚Äù and does not apply to tourists or undocumented immigrants. This theory, once considered unorthodox, has been promoted by conservative legal scholars and now forms the basis of Trump's immigration policies. The Supreme Court will consider whether federal judges have the power to issue nationwide injunctions, with the question of birthright citizenship as the backdrop.</p>
