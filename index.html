CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in the company's performance, highlighting growth in consumer transactions and merchant partnerships, which offset concerns about losing Walmart as a client.

          <p>Alibaba's stock rose nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected profits for its June quarter, driven by accelerated growth in its cloud computing unit. The cloud division's revenue grew 26% year-over-year, largely due to strong demand for artificial intelligence services, which has seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, the robust performance of the cloud business and a revival in e-commerce have bolstered investor confidence. The company is continuing to invest heavily in AI and new e-commerce models to maintain its competitive edge. (not investment advice)</p>

The 25-year-old, who was the club's second-most expensive signing, is said to have been given permission to travel to Spain for a medical. Antony had a successful loan spell with Betis last season, helping the team secure a European competition spot. This permanent move marks the end of a disappointing tenure at Manchester United, where his performance declined significantly after a promising start.</p>

          <p>Marvell Technology's stock dropped 18% after the chipmaker's data center revenue for the second quarter fell short of analyst expectations. The company also issued a lackluster forecast for the current quarter, projecting revenue slightly below Wall Street's consensus. While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, fueled by AI demand, the miss in the key data center segment and a flat sequential growth projection concerned investors. Analysts expressed caution, with Bank of America downgrading the stock due to uncertainty about the company's near-term AI growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>KUSC-FM, a prominent classical music station in Los Angeles, has laid off several employees due to significant cuts in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The station's parent entity, Classical California, confirmed it lost $1.1 million in support, forcing the workforce reduction which reportedly affected eight positions. This move reflects a broader trend of public media outlets facing budget shortfalls after the Trump administration and Republican Congress clawed back federal funds. The station, which is not an NPR affiliate, has appealed to its listeners for contributions to help cover the financial gap.</p>

Despite the sticky inflation, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are continuing to spend even as they face economic uncertainty.

The motion claims the White House used an unprecedented legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term without Senate or judicial confirmation, circumventing congressional limits on temporary appointments. This challenge is part of a growing number of legal actions against Trump-appointed prosecutors in several states who have been kept in power through similar strategies. The motion seeks to dismiss an indictment and disqualify Essayli's office from participating in criminal prosecutions.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new details about Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, which lived 165 million years ago. Based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco, scientists now have a clearer picture of the dinosaur, which featured long bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs—a trait never before seen in any vertebrate. This unique and elaborate armor has led researchers to dub it the "punk rocker" of its time. The discovery of such complex defensive features on an early ankylosaur is challenging previous theories about how this group of "tank-like" dinosaurs evolved.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won a decisive victory in the town's first election in decades. Four years ago, after running unopposed, Braxton said he was locked out of the town hall by previous White officials who refused to recognize his leadership in the majority-Black town. This led to a federal lawsuit challenging the town's "hand-me-down" system of governance, where mayors appointed their successors without elections. The recent election, held as part of a legal settlement, overwhelmingly confirmed Braxton's mandate, marking a significant moment for democratic governance in the small community.</p>

          <p>After a decade focused on smaller tours featuring his original songs, "Weird Al" Yankovic is returning to his signature large-scale productions with the "Bigger & Weirder" tour. Yankovic explains that he stepped away from his famous parodies partly because he wanted to prove he was "more than just the parody guy" and because the fragmented pop culture landscape made it harder to select universally known hits. Now, he is re-embracing the elaborate costume changes, props, and classic parodies that made him famous, backed by an expanded band to replicate the layered sounds of the original songs.</p>

          <p>Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a new congressional map for Texas, a mid-decade redistricting effort pushed by President Trump to strengthen the Republican majority in the U.S. House. The new map could allow the GOP to flip up to five seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have fiercely opposed the plan, arguing it unfairly targets and marginalizes voters of color, and staged a walkout to temporarily halt the legislative session. The new map is already facing legal challenges from Democrats and voting rights groups, continuing the contentious battle over redistricting in the state.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, "Americans and the Holocaust," which critically examines the nation's response to Nazi Germany, is set to close temporarily for an "upgrade." This has sparked concern among some staff members, who fear potential editorial changes in the wake of President Trump's review of museum content for "anti-American" material. The museum, while not part of the Smithsonian, receives federal funding and has recently seen Trump appoint new members to its board. A museum spokesperson stated the closure is for maintenance and there are no changes to the editorial content.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months. The election could result in a tied 19-19 chamber, which would allow Republicans to block Democratic legislation in the governor's final year in office. The seat became vacant after the Democratic incumbent was elected to the U.S. House. Whitmer had faced criticism from Republicans for the delay in calling the election, which they claimed was a political move to maintain a slim Democratic majority. The primary will be held in February 2026.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cut $5 billion in foreign aid that has already been allocated by Congress for the current fiscal year. The White House is using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," which requests the cancellation of funds so late in the fiscal year that they may expire before Congress can act. The proposed cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including funding for international peacekeeping and democracy promotion. The move is expected to face legal challenges, as critics argue it unconstitutionally bypasses Congress's power of the purse.</p>

For the first time, a graduating class of high school and college seniors has had access to generative AI for their entire four-year careers. While students widely use AI for everything from essays to problem sets, educators are struggling to adapt, creating what some call "pedagogical debt." The article suggests this technological shift is a breaking point, forcing a reevaluation of educational practices and raising concerns about the erosion of critical thinking skills.</p>

While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection, this term can be extended by the president, which former President Biden had reportedly done for Harris. The decision has drawn criticism from Democratic leaders, who have called it politically motivated and vindictive. This action is part of a pattern where Trump has also removed security details for other former officials and political opponents, raising concerns about the politicization of official security protocols.</p>

However, the appellate court found the original ruling to be "seriously flawed," stating it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants. The case has been a focal point for anti-immigration protests, and the local council has not ruled out taking the case to the Supreme Court.</p>
