Patterson is charged with the 2023 deaths of her estranged husband's parents and aunt, as well as the attempted murder of his uncle, after a beef Wellington lunch allegedly spiked with death cap mushrooms. Her lawyer argued that medical tests revealed symptoms in Patterson that "can't be faked," contradicting the prosecution's claim that she feigned illness. The defense maintains that Patterson panicked and lied about using foraged mushrooms in the meal, fearing she would be held responsible for the illnesses, but did not intend to harm anyone.

          <p>Crescent Duck Farm, Long Island's last commercial duck farm, is rebuilding after losing its entire flock to the avian flu. The farm had to cull its entire flock after detecting the virus in January, contributing to soaring egg prices and commodity shortages. Doug Corwin, a fourth-generation farmer, is working to restore the farm to its 100,000-bird capacity and preserve the unique lineage of fowl that has allowed the farm to thrive. The farm received federal compensation for the euthanized ducks, but it wasn't nearly close to the market value of the birds, and Corwin hopes the government will require poultry operators to vaccinate their livestock against bird flu.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments by altering the materials, dimensions, or compositions of their products. This legal practice allows finished products to fit into different "harmonized system codes" with lower tariff rates. For example, some manufacturers are bundling steel and aluminum elements into their products to qualify for lower duties under Section 232. There are over 5,000 different product classification codes that U.S. customs authorities use, providing ample opportunities for companies to strategically redesign their products. The score is 70.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that United States Steel Corp. is of growing strategic importance, particularly as higher U.S. tariffs on steel products are expected to remain in place. At a news conference, Hashimoto said that while his company's acquisition of U.S. Steel should benefit the U.S. economy, tariffs alone will not revive its manufacturing sector.
