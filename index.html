          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, which he characterized as a "spectacular military success." He warned Iran to "make peace" or face further attacks. The strikes follow escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with the U.S. military joining the conflict. Trump stated the objective was to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and eliminate the threat posed by the country. This action signifies a major escalation in U.S. involvement in the Middle East and a departure from Trump's earlier promises to avoid new wars. The strikes have drawn mixed reactions from lawmakers, with some Republicans supporting the action and Democrats criticizing the lack of congressional authorization. The situation remains tense, with potential for Iranian retaliation and further regional instability. Optimism about the situation is relatively low.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation to announce U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, describing the action as a "spectacular military success" and warning Iran to pursue peace or face more severe consequences. He stated that the targeted facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, had been "completely and totally obliterated." Trump thanked U.S. service members and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for their collaboration. He also said that Iran's main state TV channels have so far been downplaying the impact of the strikes, claiming the sites had already been evacuated and denying any damage to the Fordo uranium enrichment facility. Prior to the strikes, Iran threatened retaliation if the U.S. joined the Israeli offensive, leading to concerns about potential escalation and regional instability. The president's remarks underscore the heightened tensions and the potential for further conflict.</p>

Both veterans participated in Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program that honors veterans with the opportunity to graduate. Snyder shared the honor with friends who did not return from the war, emphasizing the importance of recognizing veterans' service.

          <p>Robert Maginnis analyzes President Trump's decision to launch precision strikes against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, questioning whether it will halt Iran's nuclear program or ignite a wider conflict. The article suggests that the administration has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the strike, potentially provoking a long war on shaky grounds. Maginnis outlines four likely Iranian responses, including regional attacks on U.S. assets, disruption of oil routes, strikes on U.S. allies, and asymmetric attacks abroad. He warns that the strike could backfire politically inside Iran, unifying the regime and fueling nationalism. The article emphasizes the need for containment, deterrence, resilience, and diplomatic channels, urging vigilance and a clear strategy.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers across the political spectrum offered mixed responses. Republicans like Senators Graham and Cruz supported the action, while Democrats like House Leader Jeffries and Senator Schumer criticized the decision to launch the attack without congressional consultation. Jeffries argued that Trump misled the country and risked entanglement in a disastrous war. Senator Warner expressed concern that the actions could drag the U.S. into an open-ended conflict without a clear strategy. The debate highlights the constitutional questions surrounding presidential authority to use military force without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer using a non-invasive method. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine samples. A survey using the test kits detected a tumor in the lungs of a woman in her 60s, leading to successful surgery, as well as precancerous cells in other participants. The company hopes this technology will improve early cancer detection, especially in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The researchers' model aligns with the "four symbols" theory, emphasizing the balance between passive and active forces. This study redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in a single-celled eukaryote, which is one of the smallest model organisms used in the study of molecular life mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the implications of President Trump's decision to involve the United States in a war in the Middle East by bombing Iran. The author argues that this action contradicts Trump's promises to avoid new wars and raises questions about the potential outcomes. The best-case scenario involves a humiliating end to Iran's nuclear ambitions, while the worst-case scenario involves Iran retaliating against U.S. targets and accelerating its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. The author also notes the potential for misperception, accidents, and diplomatic fallout, especially given the unqualified national-security team in charge.

          <p>World leaders have responded to President Trump's announcement that the U.S. carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu praised Trump's decision, while UN Secretary-General Guterres warned that the strikes represent a dangerous escalation. Venezuela and Cuba condemned the attacks, while Mexico called for diplomatic dialogue. Reactions across the globe are slowly coming in as leaders weigh the impact of the attack. South Korea's presidential office is set to host an emergency meeting to discuss the attack.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the risks associated with President Trump's decision to insert the US into the conflict between Iran and Israel. The author argues that Trump's move could lead to a worst-case scenario for the U.S., the region, and the world. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned of a "spiral of chaos" that could result from the American decision to escalate the conflict. The author questions whether the strikes will force Iran to make greater concessions or lead to further escalation. Trump's reputation as a peacemaker is also called into question.</p>

          <p>President Trump ordered a U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities just two days after stating he would decide "within the next two weeks" on whether to take such action, ostensibly to give diplomacy a chance. On Friday, he said it was to give time for the Iranians to "come to their senses." The president also dismissed talks between European diplomats and Iran's foreign minister. The decision to strike came as a surprise, given the recent offer from the U.S. to resume nuclear negotiations and Trump's distrust for his own intelligence community.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has attacked Iranian nuclear sites, pushing America into Israel's war with its longtime rival. U.S. Navy submarines also launched more than 30 Tomahawk missiles into Iran. The decision to attack Iran engages the American military in active warfare in the Middle East, something Trump had vowed to avoid. Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said recently that "any American military entry will undoubtedly be met with irreparable damage." After the U.S. strikes, it was unclear what options remained for an Iranian retaliation against the United States.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are rolling out “property supermarkets” to support the struggling housing market. These platforms, both online and offline, allow consumers to view homes more transparently and efficiently. Chengdu recently launched a homebuying platform in partnership with state-owned and private developers, featuring over 50 projects on a mobile app. Similar initiatives have been rolled out in other cities, with some including second-hand listings and physical storefronts. The platforms aim to improve transaction efficiency and minimize false promotions, though access may be limited to residents with housing vouchers.</p>

Reed believes Trump's actions are related to his consideration of an attack against Iran, as he needs to establish that Iran has the capacity and intent to develop a nuclear weapon. Weeks ago, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified that the intelligence community continues to assess "Iran is not building a nuclear weapon."

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband Bob was overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and cast doubt on the original verdict. The Loyola Project for the Innocent helped uncover that some blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. While Dorotik was released, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again if new evidence surfaces. Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women.</p>

The U.S. contacted Iran to say the air strikes were all it intended to do and that "regime change efforts" were "not planned". The US says it hit three nuclear sites - at Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Iran could respond by targeting US military assets in the region. The US and Iran were in nuclear talks at the time of Israel's surprise attack.

The action marks a direct military strike on Iran for the first time since the start of the Israel-Iran war. Trump's 2025 inauguration speech emphasized ending wars and avoiding new conflicts, calling his legacy that of a "peacemaker and a unifier." The recent U.S. strike breaks from these promises, raising questions about the future of diplomacy and regional stability. The decision also contrasts with Trump's 2024 campaign pledges to prevent World War Three and end chaos in the Middle East.</p>
