          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group surged 36% on its market debut, following Sony Group's spin-off of the unit. This strategic separation allows the financial arm to raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties with the wider Sony ecosystem. The parent company cited competing demands for investment in entertainment and semiconductors as a key reason for the financial unit to operate independently. This strong debut reflects positive investor sentiment amidst broader gains in most Asian markets, despite some regional declines and ongoing economic tensions.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Bualoi made an earlier-than-predicted landfall in Vietnam, bringing speeds over 130 km/h, widespread floods, airport closures, and the evacuation of thousands. The storm, which previously killed 11 in the Philippines, has now caused at least one death in Vietnam, with a dozen fishermen missing. Nghe An province experienced weakened speeds of 88 km/h, but national forecasts warn of prolonged wind and rain, risking flash floods and landslides. Vietnam's geographical vulnerability to typhoons has already led to over 100 deaths from natural disasters this year.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has ended his bid for reelection, citing constant media speculation and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold funds. His withdrawal sets up a three-way race between Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who faced a tumultuous year with a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, stated he was "wrongfully charged" for fighting for the city. His departure shifts the dynamic of the upcoming mayoral election significantly.</p>

Air China and China Eastern Airlines received only one C919 each, despite aiming for ten apiece in 2025, while China Southern Airlines noted "financially leased" three without ownership. This raises market speculation about potential disruptions in the model's engine supply. The Shanghai-based firm, COMAC, has transported over 2 million passengers since the jet's 2023 commercial debut, but analyst Li Hanming suggests engine procurement is encountering turbulence.</p>

Psychologist Suzy Reading identifies common signs as excessive attention-seeking and subtle mood erosion. Author Radhika Sanghani suggests assessing how you feel after interactions. The article proposes three strategies: honest communication to express feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries if behavior doesn't change, and altering shared activities to reduce dominance. These methods aim to protect one's well-being in challenging friendships.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are expected to resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program to significantly cut the federal workforce. With a government shutdown deadline looming, the White House has also ordered agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if funding isn't authorized. Workers describe feeling compelled to leave due to "fear and intimidation," citing a loss of mission, scapegoating, and uncertain job security.

          <p>President Trump's administration is requesting an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, despite two federal courts previously blocking it.

          <p>Two eyewitnesses to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University are calling for a return to civilized debate in America. Hunter Kozak, a liberal who was the last person to speak with Kirk, and Jeb Jacobi, a conservative student who admired Kirk, both emphasize the necessity of civil conversations despite differing viewpoints. Utah Governor Spencer Cox echoed this sentiment, visiting the campus to promote unity. The incident, where Kirk was fatally shot by a sniper during a debate, has prompted reflections on the need for respectful engagement in political discourse.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entry fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. This measure aims to control the overwhelming 2.6 million annual tourists, which strains the small community of 100 residents and compromises their privacy. The fee will include museum and windmill access, currently separate charges. While local shop and restaurant owners fear a loss of business, the council intends to use the revenue for maintenance and infrastructure. Tourist opinions are divided on the new charge.</p>

          <p>The growing use of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is sparking concerns that obesity management is becoming a wealth issue, as NHS access is tightly restricted. An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs, but over 90% pay privately, costing £100-£350 monthly. This creates a "postcode lottery" for NHS prescriptions, disproportionately affecting deprived areas where obesity rates are higher. Experts warn that good health could become a luxury, exacerbating existing health inequalities. The article also discusses potential price hikes and the emergence of a black market.</p>
