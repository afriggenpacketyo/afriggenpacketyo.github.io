          <p>Kaori Sakamoto, a three-time world champion in figure skating, announced her retirement from competition following the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. Sakamoto, who won a bronze medal at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games and finished second at the world championships in Boston, revealed her decision at the opening of a new skating rink in her hometown of Kobe. She cited her age as a factor, stating that she would be 29 at the subsequent Olympics in 2030, making it unlikely for her to continue competing. Sakamoto, who debuted at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, recently won her fourth straight Japanese championship. Optimism about her future endeavors is high as she transitions into a new phase of her career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US appeals court ruled that former President Donald Trump can retain control over National Guard troops in Los Angeles, despite objections from California's governor. The unanimous ruling stated that Trump's failure to issue the federalization order directly through the governor did not limit his authority to call up the National Guard. The court found that the Trump administration presented a defensible rationale for mobilizing 4,000 National Guard members to protect federal personnel and property. While Trump celebrated the ruling as a "BIG WIN," Governor Newsom emphasized that the President's powers are not unlimited, vowing to challenge any authoritarian use of the military against citizens. This legal battle highlights ongoing tensions between federal and state authority.</p>

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party is urging local governments to carefully implement austerity measures on lavish banquets, amid concerns about the impact on the food and beverage industry. Party publications emphasized that frugality regulations are intended to limit extravagant practices, not ordinary dining, after some local governments overzealously scrutinized meal gatherings and canceled official receptions. Such measures have complicated understanding of the regulations and brought unnecessary shocks to the catering industry. The curbs on excess in official meals followed the release of regulations on thrift and waste in government bodies, banning high-end dishes, cigarettes, and liquor at official events, leading localities to roll out their own guidelines.</p>

          <p>Shares in Pop Mart, the maker of Labubu dolls, experienced a decline after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its focus list and Chinese state media advocated for stricter regulation of "blind box" toys. The company gained popularity through its "blind box" concept, where consumers purchase unmarked boxes for a chance to acquire unique figurines. People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, criticized the "blind box" phenomenon, particularly its impact on children spending heavily to collect cards. China's customs agency also highlighted its efforts to stop Labubu copycats from crossing the border. The stock's recent performance marks its first negative week since early May, raising concerns about the company's future growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump, who previously honored Juneteenth in his first four years as president, remained silent about the holiday this year. In contrast to his past acknowledgements, Trump did not issue any statements or posts on social media regarding Juneteenth, a day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. When questioned, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that Trump would not be signing a proclamation and thanked reporters for working on the federal holiday. Trump's silence contrasts sharply with his prior statements, including claims that he had made Juneteenth "very famous," and deviates from earlier White House guidance suggesting he would issue a proclamation.</p>

          <p>A contentious series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres culminated in a benches-clearing incident and managerial ejections. Tensions escalated in the final inning after Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit by a pitch, prompting Padres manager Mike Shildt to confront Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, leading to a heated exchange and both benches emptying. The scuffle resulted in the ejections of both managers. Despite a late rally by the Dodgers, the Padres held on for a 5-3 victory, concluding a heated stretch of rivalry baseball between the two teams.

The Golden Dome project, which aims to defend the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through a network of satellites, sensors, and interceptors, has garnered interest from private space companies.

          <p>Trade Minister Douglas Alexander suggested that public support for international aid spending has waned, arguing that even without financial constraints, the case for foreign aid would need to be made. His comments come after Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a cut in the international aid budget to fund increased defense spending, a move criticized by charities. Alexander acknowledged the importance of building a stable and safe world but noted a decline in public consent for aid. While some argue that public support remains strong, Alexander urged leadership to remake the case to the British public, highlighting the need to address cultural challenges alongside fiscal concerns.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that children with lazy eyes are increasingly being missed for treatment due to the lack of early screenings in schools. Some councils are unable to offer this service because of budget constraints. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society is advocating for vision screening to be provided in all schools in England, as it is in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Early detection and treatment, ideally before the age of seven, are crucial for correcting amblyopia, the medical term for lazy eye, using patching. Increased funding for public health grants is needed to support school-based screenings and improve child health.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits. The low-cost coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more. Tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, the coating costs just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. This new preservation strategy is as effective as existing methods while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and potential toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The team used computer-aided molecular simulation to develop the eco-friendly coating.</p>

Economists are closely monitoring these trends, as rice accounts for a significant portion of Japan's core inflation.

Several factors contribute to the lack of interest, including FIFA's inability to convince fans and players of the tournament's necessity and the scheduling of games during the summer months. The hot and humid conditions have also affected the quality of play, with some players expressing difficulty performing in the heat.

          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, stated that he has fathered more than 100 children through sperm donation, in addition to being the official father of six other children with three different partners. He intends for all of his offspring to share his estimated $13.9 billion fortune equally, but none will have access to their inheritance for 30 years. Durov desires for his children to live like normal people, building themselves up independently and trusting their own abilities. The 40-year-old said he wrote a will now because his job defending freedoms earns him many enemies, including within powerful states.</p>

The U.S. government obtained a golden share allowing it to veto key management decisions, and Nippon Steel is obliged to invest $11 billion by 2028 on bolstering U.S. Steel's operations. Companies are pausing investments due to uncertainty surrounding political and economic dynamics in Washington. Despite these challenges, the United States remains a lucrative market with high growth potential, but global companies are beginning to reduce their reliance on it due to tariffs and political pressures.

          <p>As the 50th anniversary of the film "Jaws" is observed, reports of recent shark attacks are making headlines. Despite these incidents, an activist emphasizes that the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions, rather than an increase in shark populations. She also shared tips for encountering a shark in the water, such as staying calm and maintaining eye contact. A daring endurance athlete is commemorating the anniversary by swimming 62 miles around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness of the need to protect sharks and change public perception of the fish.</p>

          <p>China has been urged to use the resumption of visits to Tibet by Indian pilgrims as an opportunity to improve relations between the two countries. After a five-year suspension due to Covid controls and border tensions, China is allowing pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer. The sites are sacred to followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Bon, and pilgrimages are usually organized by the Indian government. Yang Yabo, director of the Institute of South Asia Studies, noted that these pilgrimages have historically played a positive role in restoring stability during times of crisis.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft resigned as a government whip in protest against the government's plans to cut disability benefits. Foxcroft stated that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution to address the welfare bill. The government defended its reforms, arguing they will ensure those who can work should, those who want to work are properly supported, and those with the most severe disabilities and health conditions are protected. More than 100 Labour MPs have expressed concern about the bill, potentially leading to a large rebellion during the vote. The government's bill tightens criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit.</p>

Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending tariffs.

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided to leave National Guard troops in Los Angeles under the control of the Trump administration, while California's legal challenges continue. The court found that the president has broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, though not "unreviewable." California leaders vowed to continue fighting back in federal court. The ruling largely returns the issue to U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer. The appellate panel sharply questioned both sides during Tuesdayâ€™s hearing, appearing to reject the federal governmentâ€™s assertion that courts had no right to review the presidentâ€™s actions, while also undercutting Californiaâ€™s claim that Trump had overstepped his authority in sending troops to L.A.</p>
