The market report also noted a rise in shares for Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk following an announcement of significant job cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has created an AI-powered system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons during operations. This "third hand" can perform routine tasks like retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, allowing surgeons to focus on more complex aspects of the procedure. The development, detailed in the journal *Science Robotics*, aims to alleviate the strain on surgeons and potentially reduce surgical wait times amid the growing demands of an aging population.</p>

          <p>Poland, with support from NATO allies, shot down multiple Russian drones that violated its airspace during a large-scale aerial assault on Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described the incursion as an "act of aggression," and one drone reportedly struck a house, though no injuries occurred. The incident prompted a heightened state of alert and a temporary suspension of flights at Warsaw's Chopin Airport, while EU officials suggested the violation appeared to be intentional, escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The repatriation of South Korean workers detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia may be delayed due to unspecified issues on the U.S. side. The raid, which saw 475 people detained for allegedly working illegally, has created diplomatic sensitivity as South Korea is a key U.S. ally and has pledged significant investments in America. South Korean officials are in discussions with the Trump administration to ensure the workers can return home promptly and to prevent similar future incidents.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index fell by 0.4% in August from a year earlier, a steeper decline than economists had anticipated, signaling that deflationary pressures continue to plague the economy. The producer price index also remained in negative territory, marking its third consecutive year of deflation, although the decline has eased slightly. The persistent price weakness reflects sluggish domestic demand and has intensified calls for Beijing to implement more robust fiscal support to stimulate the economy and counteract weakening export growth.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to influence the central bank. The judge ruled that the 'for cause' provision for removing a governor likely does not apply to conduct that occurred before taking office, referring to the mortgage fraud allegations cited by Trump. This decision allows Cook to remain in her role while her lawsuit proceeds, reaffirming the principle of Federal Reserve independence.</p>

          <p>A new UNICEF report reveals that for the first time, obesity has overtaken undernourishment as the primary form of malnutrition among school-aged children and adolescents globally. Since 2000, the rate of obesity among those aged five to nineteen has nearly tripled, while the number of underweight children has decreased. The report attributes this alarming trend to the proliferation of unhealthy food environments dominated by ultra-processed and fast foods, urging for systemic changes like better food labeling and marketing restrictions.</p>

The messages, from business leaders, politicians, and friends, paint a portrait of a world where Epstein's behavior was openly referenced long before his criminal convictions.</p>

The strike hit a residential compound where the delegation was reportedly discussing a U.S.-proposed ceasefire, prompting condemnation from Qatar, which called it a "cowardly" act. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the strike was "fully justified," as it targeted those who organized the October 7th attack, further complicating diplomatic efforts to end the war.</p>
