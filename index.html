            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration to eliminate its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and alter its admissions processes, potentially jeopardizing nearly $9 billion in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that no government should dictate the intellectual conditions of private universities. The administration's demands included screening international students for ideological concerns and ensuring viewpoint diversity in hiring practices. Harvard's lawyers assert that the requested changes violate the university's First Amendment rights and exceed the government's legal authority.</p>

The businesses contend that trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, do not represent an unusual and extraordinary threat. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses, argues that the tariffs are devastating small businesses across the country.</p>

            <p>Ghana has announced a ban on all foreigners trading in its local gold market, effective May 1, as part of reforms to boost foreign exchange reserves and stabilize the local currency. The Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod) will have exclusive authority to regulate and control artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Foreigners can apply to GoldBod to buy gold directly from them. The move aims to address illegal activities and environmental degradation often associated with foreign involvement in the sector.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump insulted CNN journalist Kaitlan Collins for questioning why his administration is refusing to comply with a Supreme Court order in a deportation case. Collins asked Trump about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Trump responded by suggesting Collins should focus on keeping criminals out of the country and claimed she lacked credibility. Bukele stated he had no intention of intervening in Abrego Garcia’s case.</p>

            <p>Harvard University said on Monday that it will not comply with a new list of demands from the Trump administration issued last week that the government says are designed to crack down on antisemitism and alleged civil rights violations at elite academic institutions. In a message to the Harvard community, the university president, Alan Garber, vowed that the school would not yield to the government’s pressure campaign. The Trump administration said it would review $9bn of federal grants and contracts, including Harvard’s research hospitals, as part of its effort to “root out antisemitism”.</p>

            <p>The zero-day options market is amplifying volatility on Wall Street amid tariff uncertainty. Zero-day-to-expiration options are contracts that expire the same day that they're traded. Trading volume of these options tied to the S&P 500 surged in April. Wild intraday gyrations in stocks since "liberation day" have put investors more on edge than ever, and the popularity of zero-day-to-expiration options is partly to blame. Volatility surged as Trump introduced steep tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and repeatedly reversed and changed his own policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing to slash the state department budget by nearly half. The cuts would mean drastic decreases in funding for humanitarian assistance, global health and international organizations. The memo assumes that USAID, previously an independent agency before it was targeted by Doge, would be encompassed fully under the state department umbrella. There would also be drastic reductions to the state department workforce, which currently stands at 80,000.</p>
