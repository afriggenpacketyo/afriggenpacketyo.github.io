          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that recent U.S.-Israeli strikes had completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, dismissing a preliminary Pentagon report suggesting the program was only set back by months. Speaking at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, Trump insisted that Iran's facilities were "gone for years" and that rebuilding would be extremely difficult. However, Democratic senators emphasized the need for answers and a return to negotiations, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supported Trump's position, attributing any contrary assessments to political motives. The situation remains contentious, with conflicting reports and political divides surrounding the extent of the damage and the future of U.S.-Iranian relations. </p>

          <p>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has publicly criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointments to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), stating that many lack relevant expertise. This criticism comes after Cassidy voted to confirm Kennedy, swayed by promises of collaboration and maintaining the ACIP's integrity. Kennedy subsequently fired all 17 ACIP members and appointed individuals with anti-vaccine views, prompting Cassidy to call for a delay in the committee's first conference until more balanced representation is achieved. Experts question whether credible scientists will join the committee with anti-science activists present, highlighting the damage to public health expertise. </p>

          <p>NATO allies have committed to raising their defense spending target to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035, more than doubling the previous target of 2%. This decision, announced at a summit in The Hague, reflects a united front against security threats, particularly the long-term threat posed by Russia and the persistent threat of terrorism. The increased spending will be allocated to core defense requirements and defense-related critical infrastructure, with member states required to submit annual plans demonstrating progress toward the goal. The move follows years of pressure from the U.S. for allies to share more of the collective defense burden. </p>

          <p>European health authorities are cautioning about a potential increase in COVID-19 infections due to the spread of the new Omicron subvariant NB.1.8.1, known as "Nimbus." Population immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has declined in Europe, possibly due to fewer winter cases, potentially leading to more severe cases requiring hospitalization. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends boosters for at-risk groups and those in high-risk settings, emphasizing continued vigilance. While Bangladesh has already reported deaths from COVID-19, the ECDC stresses that SARS-CoV-2 is not yet a seasonal pathogen like influenza, necessitating ongoing caution and monitoring. </p>

This move, described as the "biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation," comes in response to growing nuclear threats. While the jets can carry conventional weapons, they offer the option of equipping US-made nuclear bombs, requiring authorization from NATO's nuclear planning group and both the US and British leaders for their use. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review, highlighting increased nuclear risks from other nations modernizing their arsenals, and is expected to support thousands of jobs across the UK. </p>

          <p>Jacky Jhaj, a British man, has been charged in France for allegedly staging a mock wedding with a child at Disneyland Paris. Jhaj, a registered sexual offender in the UK, reportedly paid around Â£110,000 to hire Disneyland for the private event, which was halted by park staff who noticed the child bride in high heels. French prosecutors are in contact with British authorities regarding Jhaj's status as a wanted man in the UK for breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

Strategies for securing good CD rates include considering online banks and short-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve.
