          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a 101.7% year-over-year spike, following similar increases in the prior months. The Japanese government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate prices of this staple food, yet core inflation climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023. JP Morgan Asset Management strategist Marcella Chow notes that rice accounts for about 50% of Japan's core inflation, making food prices a key factor in future inflation trends. Government measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending if extended to processed foods and restaurant prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's central bank maintained its benchmark lending rates, keeping the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, after cutting rates last month for the first time since October. This decision comes as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth worries, with both countries agreeing to honor the consensus reached in Geneva. Nomura economists have trimmed their rate-cut forecast for the fourth quarter, suggesting Chinese authorities may exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus. Chinese policymakers seem satisfied with the current monetary policy stance, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>At a recent high-level summit, China and its Central Asian partners expressed shared security concerns, presenting a united front amidst global turbulence. The close ties between China and the five Central Asian countries have sparked questions about Russia's regional dominance as it remains focused on the conflict in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed these concerns, emphasizing that China is a privileged strategic partner and Central Asian countries are natural historical partners. However, diplomatic observers note that Moscow's capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence is limited.</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices in May increased by 3.7% year-over-year, marking the largest rise in over two years, driven by surging rice and food costs. The nationwide consumer price index, excluding fresh food, has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Rice prices have set a fresh record for the eighth consecutive month, jumping 101.7% due to supply shortages, while Takeshi Minami from the Norinchukin Research Institute expects rice prices to decline with the new harvest in the fall. Service prices, closely monitored by the BOJ, climbed 1.4% in May, led by higher dining out and travel costs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively pursuing AI talent, recently hiring Daniel Gross, the CEO of Ilya Sutskever's startup Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. This move follows Meta's unsuccessful attempt to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, and its earlier poaching of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang. Zuckerberg's strategy escalates the AI talent war, with Meta, Google, and OpenAI competing to develop powerful large language models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has claimed Meta offered signing bonuses as high as $100 million to lure OpenAI employees, highlighting the intensity of the competition.</p>

Former National Park Service Director Chuck Sams warns that the proposed cuts could force the closure of over 300 park sites, including the Till monument.

          <p>Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca as a Category 3 hurricane, later weakening to a tropical storm, leaving flooded streets and damaged boats and buildings. Despite the weakening, officials cautioned that Erick's intense rains remained dangerous, with life-threatening flooding and mudslides likely. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum reported that people reacted well, and while there were no immediate reports of deaths, two hospitals were damaged and the power supply was compromised. The state-owned utility company is working to restore power to over 123,000 users in Oaxaca.</p>

          <p>Maternity services at two Leeds hospitals have been downgraded from "good" to "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) due to failings that posed a significant risk to women and babies. The downgrade follows concerns from staff and patients regarding quality of care and staffing levels. The CQC found breaches relating to risk management, safe environment, learning following incidents, and staffing, leading to a warning notice requiring immediate action. The trust says 35 newly qualified midwives are due to start work and it has also appointed additional midwifery leadership roles.</p>

          <p>An expert familiar with Iran's nuclear program suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant might not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The exact nature of the concrete and metal protecting the site is not fully known, and using the untested weapon would not guarantee success. Joe Cirincione suggests that attacking Iran's nuclear enrichment program would cripple, but not eliminate, its nuclear weapons capability. He stressed that continued military strikes would not be a good option for Israel or the U.S. if the goal is an Iran without nuclear weapons.</p>
