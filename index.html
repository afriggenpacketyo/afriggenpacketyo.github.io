          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded a high-stakes summit in Alaska without achieving a breakthrough on ending the war in Ukraine. Despite the lack of a concrete deal, Trump described the talks as "productive," while Putin characterized them as a "starting point" for improving relations, which he noted are at their lowest since the Cold War. The discussions, which did not include Ukrainian representatives, have raised concerns about potential compromises affecting Ukraine's sovereignty, though Trump stated he would update President Zelenskyy on the talks. Putin also extended an invitation for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical analysis from The Guardian portrays the Alaska summit as an event where President Trump appeared deferential to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The article highlights moments of apparent camaraderie, such as Putin endorsing Trump's claims about the 2020 election and the war in Ukraine, which the author suggests was a tactic to appeal to Trump. The piece frames the summit not as a negotiation between equals but as a victory for Putin, who was welcomed back onto the world stage despite international condemnation for war crimes. The author concludes that Putin effectively manipulated the meeting by reinforcing Trump's personal grievances to achieve his diplomatic goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC outlines five key takeaways from the summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, emphasizing that the meeting yielded more questions than answers. A primary outcome was the symbolic victory for Putin, who was welcomed with a red carpet on U.S. soil, effectively ending his status as a pariah in the West. The analysis notes that while Putin faced rare, direct questions from Western media, the post-summit statements were vague and revealed no concrete progress on a Ukraine ceasefire. Trump's remarks were notably brief and did not mention Ukraine directly, while Putin hinted that his core demands, amounting to Kyiv's capitulation, remain unchanged.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's government is implementing new residency regulations that require mainland Chinese spouses to prove they have relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. The policy, announced by President Lai Ching-te, is part of a broader strategy to counter escalating threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration and security risks posed by ambiguous dual-status residency. Applicants must now provide notarized proof of renouncing their Chinese registration and passport, or an affidavit if official proof is unavailable. Critics argue these changes amount to a significant and harsh turn in cross-strait residency governance, creating major hurdles for mainland nationals seeking to live in Taiwan.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The team overcame recent struggles, including a four-game losing streak and the loss of third baseman Max Muncy to the injured list. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered six strong innings, supported by solid defense and timely offense, including a go-ahead sacrifice fly from Mookie Betts in the third inning. The Dodgers' often-unreliable bullpen managed to protect the narrow lead, successfully closing out the game and providing a much-needed morale boost for the team amid a difficult stretch of their season.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump shared ten takeaways in an exclusive interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Trump emphasized that while "a lot of progress" was made, "there's no deal until there's a deal," and declined to specify the remaining sticking points for a Ukraine ceasefire. He stated that the onus is now on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to "make a deal" and suggested he would be open to a future trilateral meeting. Trump also revealed that Putin agreed the war would not have happened if he were president and claimed the Russian leader attributed his 2020 election loss to mail-in voting.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane over the Atlantic, becoming the first hurricane of the 2025 season. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center expect it to continue strengthening, potentially reaching major hurricane status over the weekend with winds of at least 111 mph. While the storm is not currently projected to impact the United States mainland, residents in the Caribbean, including the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, are advised to monitor its progress. The hurricane's path is expected to curve northward, bringing heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf conditions to the islands as it passes just to their north.</p>

          <p>In a Fox News interview after his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump suggested that key terms for ending the war, including potential land swaps, were "largely agreed on." When asked about an endgame involving expanded Russian territory and U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, Trump confirmed these were points that had been negotiated and were close to a resolution. He described the three-hour meeting with the Russian president as "very warm" and stated that the two sides were "pretty close to a deal." These comments provide more specific insight into the nature of the discussions than the vague official statements made immediately after the summit.</p>

          <p>In a significant political maneuver, California Democrats have unveiled a new congressional redistricting proposal designed to create five more Democrat-leaning districts. The plan is a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas and aims to bolster the Democratic party's chances of controlling the U.S. House of Representatives. This aggressive gerrymandering would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. The proposed maps would drastically alter the composition of several districts currently held by Republicans, consolidating Democratic voters to create significant registration advantages and potentially facing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Alaska summit, despite producing no concrete deal on Ukraine, was a significant diplomatic victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The article contends that Putin achieved his primary goal of being welcomed back onto the world stage, receiving a red-carpet reception on U.S. soil after years of being treated as an international pariah. While President Trump left empty-handed on his promise to end the war, Putin conceded nothing on his maximalist demands regarding Ukraine. The author suggests that the summit's vagueness and lack of deliverables ultimately benefit Putin by buying him more time to continue his military campaign.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force following a lawsuit filed by the city. An agreement reached after an emergency court hearing ensures that Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, reversing an earlier order that placed a DEA administrator in charge. U.S. District Judge Ana C Reyes had expressed skepticism about the legality of the full takeover during arguments. The revised directive still allows the administration to use D.C. police for federal purposes, such as assisting with immigration enforcement, but restores day-to-day operational control to local leadership, resolving a tense standoff.</p>

He escaped after a tower guard unlocked a gate for him without confirming his identity.

San José was the first city in the state to adopt this ordinance, and officials hope it will serve as a model for other cities.

The research suggests that pollution originates from a wide variety of sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads.

Muncy's absence earlier in the season coincided with a major offensive slump for the team, highlighting his importance to the lineup. With other key infielders also on the injured list, the Dodgers will have to rely on their minor-league depth to fill the void left by the veteran power hitter, who has 17 home runs and 64 RBIs this season.</p>

          <p>A Vox newsletter summarizes the Alaska summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, concluding that the nearly three-hour meeting produced no tangible progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. The main takeaway is the absence of a peace deal or even a temporary ceasefire. Both leaders made vague, non-committal remarks, with Trump calling the meeting "productive" but admitting that key issues remain unresolved. The article notes that Trump, who once promised to end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office, appeared more conciliatory than in recent weeks, backing away from his threats of "severe consequences" if no deal was reached.</p>
