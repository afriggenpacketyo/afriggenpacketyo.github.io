            <p>Following the deadly shooting at Florida State University, the alleged gunman has been identified as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, the stepson of a Leon County sheriff's deputy. The incident resulted in two fatalities and six injuries. Authorities indicated that Ikner had access to one of his stepmother's personal weapons, a handgun, and also possessed a shotgun during the shooting. Court documents reveal Ikner was previously involved in a custody dispute stretching from Florida to Norway and had a history of mental health issues.

            <p>New research suggests that brown rats may have been domesticated in China as early as the Ming Dynasty, with evidence found in silk paintings dating back to the 15th century. Researchers theorize that these domesticated rats could have spread around the world via the treasure ship fleets of explorer Zheng He. Brown rats, known for their adaptability, are now a widespread species used in biological and clinical research. This discovery sheds light on the early domestication and global distribution of these creatures.</p>

            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China has missed several key targets in its "Made in China 2025" plan, aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in technology. While China has exceeded goals in the automotive sector, it has not met targets in aerospace, high-end robotics, and manufacturing value-added growth. The plan, while fostering technological advancement, has also contributed to overcapacity and trade tensions. Despite not fully achieving its objectives, China has significantly increased its manufacturing value add, becoming a major global competitor.</p>

The order restricts DOGE members from accessing personally identifiable information and installing software on SSA computer systems.

            <p>President Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni discussed the possibility of a trade deal between the US and Europe during Meloni's visit to Washington. Meloni hopes to act as a bridge between the EU and the US amid trade tensions. Trump expressed confidence in reaching a fair deal but stated he was in "no rush." The leaders also discussed defense spending, immigration, and tariffs, with Meloni inviting Trump to visit Rome to meet with other European leaders.</p>

            <p>The global economy is facing an escalating trade war and policy shifts driven by the US administration, causing significant volatility in global markets. The lack of a clear international response to aggressive US trade policies is concerning. While some argue that tariffs are used to address trade imbalances, they ultimately impose costs on everyone, disrupt supply chains, and harm consumers. The US may be attempting to reverse globalization, but reshoring manufacturing would require significant investment and lead to inflation.</p>

The project, funded by the UK government, aims to determine if capturing carbon from the sea is a more efficient method than capturing it directly from the air. The facility processes seawater to remove carbon before pumping it back out to sea, where it absorbs more CO2. While the project's current carbon removal is minimal, researchers believe it has the potential to be scaled up.</p>
