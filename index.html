          <p>Donald Trump questioned Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war in Ukraine after meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral. Trump expressed concern that Putin might not want to stop the war following Moscow's strikes on Kyiv. The meeting was described as "very productive" by the White House and "potentially historic" by Zelensky, marking their first face-to-face encounter since February's acrimonious Oval Office showdown. Trump previously blamed Ukraine for the war and accused Zelensky of obstructing peace negotiations, but the tone shifted after their meeting in Rome.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41, confirmed by her family. Her family's statement said that she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and that she was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Prince Andrew and others, claims which Andrew has denied. Giuffre formed a nonprofit called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR) to educate and advocate for sex trafficking victims. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas appointed Hussein al-Sheikh, a close confidant, as his deputy, signaling a potential successor amid concerns about the aging leader's future. Some analysts view this as Abbas's endorsement of al-Sheikh as his preferred heir, while others consider it a cosmetic reshuffle to appease frustrated Arab officials. The focus on palace politics amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Israeli military operations in the West Bank has fueled Palestinian discontent with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority. Ghaith al-Omari, a former adviser to Abbas, criticized the leadership's priorities, highlighting a disconnect between their actions and the pressing issues faced by Palestinians.</p>

Despite a barren run earlier in the season following the loss of key players, Chairman Steve Parish backed Glasner, emphasizing his positive attitude and belief in the team's ability to win. Glasner's crowning moment was winning the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022, and claiming the first major honor in Crystal Palace's history may even top that.

          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in American faith in Donald Trump across various issues, including the economy and immigration, with a majority describing his second term as "scary." Only 24% of Americans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities, and his approval ratings are historically low for a leader this early in a term. Even among Republicans, a narrow majority is convinced that Trump's attention is in the right place, while independent voters express significant concerns. These reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, suggesting growing fatigue after a period marked by market instability and controversial deportations.</p>

Trump's realization came after months of European leaders trying to convey this message. Trump's post attacking the New York Times showed the US president is notoriously mercurial. The meeting, however, could mark a turning point, though whether the symbolism of the summit will translate into policy remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>A letter written aboard the Titanic by first-class passenger Archibald Gracie IV sold for £300,000 ($399,390) at auction in the UK. Gracie wrote the letter on April 10, 1912, the day the Titanic set sail, and it is believed to be the only one he wrote aboard the ship. Gracie survived the sinking and later wrote a detailed account of the disaster. He never fully recovered from hypothermia and died months after the event.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the practicality of shifting U.S. iPhone assembly to India, citing the continued reliance on Chinese-made components. He argues that moving assembly to India may not effectively reduce costs related to tariffs and that the supply chain would still be heavily anchored in China. Moffett also suggests that backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs could negatively impact iPhone sales. Moffett has a "sell" rating on Apple and a price target well below the current market value. (not investment advice)</p>
