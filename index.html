          <p>Campaigners are pressuring UK ministers to preserve the legally binding Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities. They warn that eliminating these protections could deny thousands of children vital support or even access to education. While the government has acknowledged the system's complexities and has not ruled out changes, it insists no decisions have been made and that support for children will be strengthened. This comes as new data shows a significant increase in the number of EHCPs being issued and requested.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration is increasing pressure on its trading partners to finalize new trade agreements before a potential August 1 deadline for higher tariffs. White House officials have stated that dozens of letters will be sent to countries without deals, warning of the impending rate hikes. While some agreements have been reached, including with Vietnam, questions remain about which other nations will be affected. The administration's strategy is described as applying maximum pressure, though officials have hinted at potential flexibility for countries negotiating in good faith. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A high-ranking police official in South Africa has accused the country's police minister and other senior officers of interfering in investigations into political assassinations. The allegations, made by KwaZulu-Natal's Provincial Commissioner, suggest an effort to protect politically connected individuals and obstruct probes into organized crime. President Cyril Ramaphosa has called the matter a "grave national security concern" that is receiving top priority. The accusations have prompted calls from opposition parties for parliamentary debates, suspensions, and an independent inquiry into corruption within the police service.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, following a warning for civilians to evacuate. The targets reportedly included the Galaxy Leader, a commercial ship hijacked by the rebel group in 2023, which Israel claims was being used for surveillance. The strikes are described as a response to the Houthis' repeated attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Following the attack, the Houthis launched two missiles toward Israel, triggering sirens.</p>

          <p>A research team at Fuzhou University in China has created a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light faster than the human eye. This new system is designed to mimic the human visual system's ability to adjust to varying light conditions and remember those settings for faster future adaptation. The technology aims to overcome the limitations of current sensors, promising quicker computation with lower energy consumption. The development represents a significant step forward in neuromorphic engineering and visual sensing technology.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in central Texas that killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about the adequacy of official warnings and evacuation procedures. Local officials stated the severity of the deluge, which caused the Guadalupe River to rise almost 30 feet, was unexpected, and noted that many warnings go unheeded in areas with poor cell coverage. While the National Weather Service defended its issuance of timely warnings, some have pointed to budget cuts and staffing shortages as potential factors.

The officials argue the changes are about requirements, not benefits, and deny that a large number of people will lose coverage, a stance that comes amid concerns about potential electoral backlash for the cuts.

The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased towards the two major parties and often require enormous signature-gathering efforts. Furthermore, any attempt would likely face intense and costly legal challenges from both Democrats and Republicans. Experts suggest that building a national party is a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project, making it an extremely daunting task even for the world's wealthiest person.</p>

          <p>Despite having one of baseball's best records, the Los Angeles Dodgers may be facing challenges that were exposed during a recent series loss to the Houston Astros. An analysis of their performance shows the team is barely over .500 against opponents with winning records, a potential concern for postseason play. The team is also contending with a growing list of injuries to key players, including Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman, which has shortened their bench. While manager Dave Roberts remains unconcerned, the combination of injuries and struggles against top teams raises questions about their championship contention.</p>

          <p>The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy and tariffs has prompted many companies to fundamentally restructure their global supply chains. An Illinois toymaker, facing a massive increase in import taxes on its Chinese-made products, is moving production to Vietnam and India to mitigate costs. Similarly, Canadian businesses are impacted by retaliatory tariffs, forcing them to alter sourcing for essential equipment. This strategic shift away from traditional manufacturing hubs like China highlights the significant and costly adjustments businesses are making to navigate the volatile landscape of international trade.

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, an analysis examines whether the UK is safer from terrorism. The 2005 attacks exposed significant shortcomings and led to a major evolution in counter-terrorism strategy, including better intelligence sharing, regional police collaboration, and new laws for prosecuting preparatory acts. However, the threat has also become more complex, shifting from organized groups like al-Qaeda to DIY attacks inspired by Islamic State and the far-right. While the state now has a more sophisticated suite of powers, it faces a more diverse and unpredictable landscape of ideologically and internet-fueled violence.</p>

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, who was accused of conspiring to bomb a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide, according to his former attorney. Park died in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, closing the only prosecution in the case after his alleged co-conspirator was killed in the bombing. Park's death has intensified scrutiny of the L.A. detention facility, with attorneys raising concerns about inhumane conditions, food shortages, and unmet medical needs. A recent Justice Department report had already highlighted significant shortcomings in the Bureau of Prisons' emergency responses to inmate deaths.</p>
