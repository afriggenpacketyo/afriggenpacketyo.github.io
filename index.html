          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 07:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating increasing its imports of soybeans and corn from the United States as part of ongoing trade negotiations. This move is intended to address excess supply in the U.S. market caused by decreased exports to China due to trade tensions. By increasing imports, Japan hopes to secure exemptions from tariffs imposed by the U.S. on automobiles, steel, aluminum, and other goods. This strategy reflects Japan's efforts to navigate complex international trade dynamics while ensuring stable access to essential agricultural commodities.</p>

          <p>Germany is considering phasing out its 1 and 2-cent euro coins, following similar moves by other European nations. The National Cash Forum, backed by the Bundesbank, argues that the coins are inefficient due to high minting costs and low circulation as people tend to hoard them. Dropping these coins would necessitate rounding cash payments to the nearest 5 cents, though electronic transactions would remain precise. While proponents cite cost savings and reduced environmental impact, concerns remain about potential price increases and the gradual elimination of cash.</p>

          <p>The custom of tipping is under renewed debate as digital payment systems increasingly prompt customers to tip for fast food and takeout orders, traditionally non-tipping scenarios. While some customers feel obligated to tip as a courtesy, others argue that tipping should be reserved for exceptional service, not routine transactions. Etiquette experts note that the original purpose of tipping was to ensure promptness, but it has evolved into a reward for hospitality. As auto-tip options creep higher, some worry that the social pressure to tip is overshadowing the spirit of rewarding excellent service.</p>

According to Tim Coyne, the firm's head of ETFs, these strategies are designed to navigate market volatility by leveraging professional portfolio management and fundamental research. TCAF aims to outperform the S&P 500 with lower volatility, while TSPA focuses on large-cap growth stocks selected through rigorous research.

          <p>A new study from India suggests that creatine, a common weightlifting supplement, may be effective in treating depression, even without the use of antidepressants. The study involved 100 participants who received either creatine supplements or a placebo while undergoing talk therapy. The creatine group showed significantly greater improvement in depression symptoms compared to the placebo group. While researchers emphasize that these findings are preliminary, they highlight creatine's potential as a cheap and accessible treatment option, especially in resource-limited settings.</p>

These individuals, who had been resettled in the US after fleeing Bhutan in the 1990s, were deported due to criminal records. Bhutanese authorities confiscated their documents and pushed them towards Nepal, while Nepal detained them for illegal entry.

          <p>An Idaho judge has ruled that Bryan Kohberger, charged with the murders of four University of Idaho students, is eligible for the death penalty despite his diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The defense argued that Kohberger's ASD reduces his culpability and that executing someone with autism would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The judge disagreed, stating that ASD is not equivalent to an intellectual disability, which would preclude the death penalty under U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The trial is set to begin August 11.</p>
