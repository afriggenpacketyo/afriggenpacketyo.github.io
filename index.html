          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 19:34:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into the deadly Air India crash that killed 270 people has found that the fuel control switches for both engines were moved to the "cutoff" position just seconds after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they had cut the fuel, with the other pilot denying they had done so. While one engine began to regain thrust after the switches were moved back, the second did not, leading to the crash. The report did not assign blame or indicate how the switches were flipped, but suggests a focus on pilot actions rather than mechanical failure.</p>

          <p>President Trump and the first lady visited Central Texas to survey the damage from last week's deadly floods, which have claimed over 120 lives with more than 160 people still missing. He met privately with families of the victims, including those from the devastated Camp Mystic, and expressed the "anguish of our entire nation." During a roundtable with officials, Trump praised the response efforts and promised to rebuild the region, but also drew criticism for calling a reporter's question about the adequacy of flood warnings "evil." The visit aimed to show federal support amid ongoing search and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>A farmworker has died from injuries sustained during a federal immigration raid at Glass House Farms, a cannabis operation in Southern California, according to the United Farm Workers union. The raid, conducted by agencies including ICE, resulted in the arrest of approximately 200 people suspected of being in the country illegally and the discovery of 10 migrant minors, prompting a child labor investigation. The union condemned the "violent and cruel federal actions," stating they terrorize communities and threaten lives, while protesters clashed with agents at the scene. The incident highlights the escalating tensions surrounding the administration's immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>A judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state of New Hampshire, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media company knowingly uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger users, keeping them engaged longer for commercial purposes. The state's Attorney General hailed the decision as a key step toward holding the platform accountable for practices that put children at risk. This case is one of several recent legal challenges by states targeting the design of tech platforms rather than user-generated content, focusing on their potential harm to youth mental health.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing growing questions about his ability to stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump in ongoing trade negotiations. The scrutiny follows a new threat from Trump to impose a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, despite Canada recently making concessions, such as scrapping a planned digital services tax. Carney, who won the election promising an assertive "elbows up" approach, is now being criticized by some for a strategy that has yet to yield significant results in de-escalating the trade conflict. The government maintains it is defending Canadian interests while dealing with an unpredictable U.S. administration.</p>

The author sardonically suggests that perhaps space exploration is no longer necessary, framing the administration's actions as part of a broader trend of undoing past national achievements. The piece questions whether the agency is being managed for decline rather than for future missions. It humorously posits that faking missions on a soundstage might be a more cost-effective approach under the new leadership.</p>

According to a recent study, one in four singles now uses AI for dating assistance, a trend driven largely by Gen Z. While some users find the technology to be a confidence booster and a useful icebreaker, it also raises questions about authenticity and the risk of misrepresenting oneself in the pursuit of connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has sharply criticized the Trump administration's decision to cut funding and effectively shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), calling the effects "entirely preventable." Gates highlighted reports from aid workers in Africa describing critical shortages of HIV medication for children and other essential medical supplies due to the funding halt. He argued that the abrupt cuts are already leading to preventable deaths and disrupting life-saving programs that the Gates Foundation has long supported. The administration absorbed USAID's functions into the State Department as part of a broader reorganization of foreign aid.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. Prosecutors allege Guzman Lopez, a key leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, oversaw a massive operation that funneled vast quantities of fentanyl into the U.S. As part of his plea deal, he has agreed to cooperate fully with federal authorities, which could potentially lead to a sentence of less than life in prison.

          <p>Prominent elected officials are increasing pressure on the Whittier City Council, accusing it of failing to respond urgently to federal immigration raids that have instilled fear in the community. The dispute centers on a proposed ordinance that would require ICE agents to be clearly identified during operations, a measure the council has delayed for a month to study its feasibility. Residents and leaders, including a Los Angeles County Supervisor, argue the delay minimizes the trauma experienced by the immigrant community. The situation is further complicated by controversy surrounding a city commissioner accused of racist conduct related to the raids.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if President Trump follows through on a threat to levy a 50% tariff on Brazilian products. Trump's threat is explicitly linked to his opposition to the criminal trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The move represents a direct use of trade policy to influence another nation's domestic legal affairs, escalating tensions between the two largest economies in the Americas. Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, risking a significant trade war.</p>

Several protesters have filed legal claims after suffering serious injuries, including one man whose finger was amputated by a flash-bang device and another who was shot in the face with a projectile. Activists argue that weapons like tear gas and rubber bullets are being used indiscriminately against peaceful crowds, despite state laws restricting their use.

          <p>The U.S. State Department initiated a major reduction-in-force, laying off more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization by the Trump administration. The cuts are part of a larger plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by about 15% and consolidate numerous offices to, as the administration claims, streamline a "bloated bureaucracy." Critics, including Democratic senators and the American Foreign Service Association, argue the indiscriminate cuts undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic readiness. The layoffs follow the shuttering of the foreign aid agency USAID, whose functions were absorbed into the department.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new record high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive surge in institutional investment. On Thursday, spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also supported by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and legislative momentum for cryptocurrency regulation. This sharp price increase triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward trend as institutional players and corporate treasuries continue to pile into the asset.
