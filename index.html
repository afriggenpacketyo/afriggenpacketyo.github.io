          <p>President Trump announced he is extending the deadline for 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9 after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump initially threatened to impose the tariffs on June 1 due to slow trade negotiations. Von der Leyen said the EU is ready to advance talks swiftly to reach a good deal, needing the time until July 9. Trump confirmed the extension, stating it was his privilege to do so, signaling a temporary reprieve in trade tensions between the US and the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy urged Western partners to increase sanctions on Russia in response to these attacks, while President Trump said he is considering further sanctions.

The increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews, which include boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews. Tripadvisor is continuously working to improve its detection methods in a constant "cat and mouse" game with those attempting to manipulate the site.</p>

          <p>Research into brain injuries among veterans is changing the way they are treated and trained, with a focus on understanding the impact of blast waves. Dr. Daniel Perl discovered microscopic scarring in the brains of service members who died by suicide, leading to further studies on brain injuries from cumulative, low-level blasts. Operation Proper Exit, a therapy program, takes combat veterans back to Iraq for emotional closure. Resources are available for suicide prevention, recognizing symptoms of blast exposure, and brain donation for research.</p>

          <p>Indian Relay, dubbed "America's original extreme sport," is a daring horse race rooted in the history of Native American tribes. The sport involves bareback riders leaping between horses while racing around a track, with teams of handlers assisting in the exchanges. The roots of the sport lie in horse-stealing raids and tribal traditions, and it serves as a way for Native American youth to reconnect with their culture. The races are gaining popularity, with increasing prize money and recognition.</p>
