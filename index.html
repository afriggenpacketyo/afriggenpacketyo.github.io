          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections through an executive order, asserting the method is corrupt despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud. The article examines the legality of such an action, noting that the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections. Experts counter the president's claims, highlighting that mail-in voting has been a secure practice since the Civil War and is used in many other developed nations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle that fled an immigration stop in Southern California after the driver allegedly struck two agents. No one was reported to have been hit by the gunfire. The incident, partially recorded by the driver's family, has intensified criticism of federal immigration enforcement tactics in the region, with local advocacy groups providing a conflicting account of the events and decrying the aggressive approach.</p>

Although their absence broke the legislature's quorum and temporarily halted the process, a new special session has been called where the maps are expected to pass. Democrats state their goal was to raise national awareness about gerrymandering and build a legal case to challenge the new maps in court as racially discriminatory.</p>

The meeting, which also included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aimed to align strategies following Trump's recent discussions with Vladimir Putin.

          <p>The Polari Prize, a significant UK-based award for LGBTQ+ literature, has been canceled for the year following widespread controversy over the nomination of author John Boyne. The backlash stemmed from an article Boyne wrote defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues, which led several other nominated authors and a judge to withdraw in protest. Organizers decided to pause the prize to review their governance and increase trans and gender non-conforming representation on their panels.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies, President Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. This marks a reversal from his position just last week and drew pushback from German and French leaders, who insisted a halt to the fighting is critical. Trump did, however, affirm that the U.S. would be involved in providing long-term security guarantees for Ukraine to ensure a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>After hitting a new record high above $124,000, the price of Bitcoin experienced a significant downturn, falling to approximately $115,000 and triggering a wider cryptocurrency market slump. The sell-off is attributed to macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected inflation data, which led to over $500 million in forced liquidations of leveraged positions. Market participants are now closely watching the Federal Reserve's upcoming economic symposium for future policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis piece notes a significant shift in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's approach during his latest visit to the White House. Unlike a contentious meeting six months prior, Zelenskyy adopted a more collegial and cautious tone, appearing in a suit and avoiding direct confrontation with President Trump in front of the media. This change in tactics suggests a learned lesson in managing the unpredictable nature of Oval Office diplomacy, prioritizing a stable appearance over public debate.</p>

In the audio, Haliva suggests that for every Israeli killed, 50 Palestinians should die to send a message to future generations, regardless of age. Haliva, who resigned over the intelligence failures that led to the attack, has confirmed the remarks were his but claimed they were taken out of context from a private discussion.</p>

          <p>The article details how a specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart, could temporarily distort their financial results as new tariffs are implemented. Because RIM relies on an average cost-to-retail price ratio, it can initially overstate profitability when product costs rise suddenly. This accounting nuance means the full financial impact of tariffs on these companies may not be immediately apparent in their quarterly earnings reports. (not investment advice)</p>
