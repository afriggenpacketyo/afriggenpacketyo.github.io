        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra, likely due to fitness issues. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting a link between his absence and his physical condition. Saka, who has 43 caps for the Three Lions, had previously missed three months of action due to a hamstring injury but returned towards the end of the season. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins was also left out and returned home due to a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear. Optimism is measured due to the injury, but the player is expected to return soon.</p>

          <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has identified Cameroon as the world's most neglected refugee crisis, citing a significant disparity between the severity of the situation and the level of political, media, and humanitarian attention it receives. More than 1.1 million people are internally displaced within Cameroon, and the country hosts 480,000 refugees from neighboring countries. Cameroon is grappling with two separate conflicts: a civil war in the western regions and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants. The NRC criticizes the reduction in development and humanitarian aid budgets by countries like the US, UK, France, and Germany, suggesting that with renewed political will, these crises could be solvable.</p>

          <p>Iran has strongly criticized the US travel ban on Iranians and citizens of other predominantly Middle Eastern and African countries, calling it a sign of a "racist mentality". The travel restrictions, implemented through an executive order, have been justified by the US on national security grounds following an attack at a pro-Israel rally. An Iranian foreign ministry official stated that the policy violates international law and deprives millions of the right to travel based on nationality or religion. Relations between Iran and the US have been strained since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with a significant Iranian community residing in the US.</p>

          <p>A furniture fraud scandal has rocked the French antiques world, involving the sale of fake 18th-century royal furniture to the Palace of Versailles and other collectors. Antiques expert Georges "Bill" Pallot and cabinetmaker Bruno Desnoues have admitted to forging chairs purported to have belonged to Marie Antoinette and other members of the French royal family. Galerie Kraemer and its director, Laurent Kraemer, are accused of deception by gross negligence for selling some of the chairs. The scheme, which started as a "joke", resulted in profits of over €3 million.</p>

          <p>MI5 provided false information to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO) regarding its handling of a neo-Nazi agent, leading the watchdog to rewrite a report. The false evidence given by MI5 contradicted an early draft of the report, which had concluded that MI5 departed from its core secrecy policy. MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements. The revelation raises questions about IPCO's oversight of MI5 and the ease with which it accepts false assurances from the Security Service.</p>

          <p>While tech billionaires pursue the secret to extended lifespans through technology and science, life expectancy is declining in several high-income countries. Public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that individual optimization is insufficient for achieving longevity, emphasizing the importance of public policy, infrastructure, and community. Sridhar suggests that governments should prioritize nutritious food, active cities, clean air policies, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water. She advocates for a world where health is a collective responsibility, not solely an individual one, drawing lessons from places where good health is integrated into daily life.</p>
