          <p>A forthcoming report on U.S. gross domestic product is anticipated to show modest but sturdy growth of 2.3% for the second quarter, suggesting the economy has largely withstood the initial impact of President Trump's tariffs. However, economists note that the GDP figures are somewhat distorted, as import fluctuations related to companies stockpiling goods to avoid tariffs can obscure the true underlying economic strength. This key economic data arrives just before the Federal Reserve is set to announce its latest decision on interest rates, with markets overwhelmingly expecting no change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket team has suffered a significant setback as captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out of the fifth Test against India with a shoulder injury. Ollie Pope will take over leadership duties, while the team will also feature three changes to its bowling lineup, leaving it looking relatively inexperienced. Stokes' absence is a major blow, as his recent form included a century and a five-wicket haul in the previous match, making him a crucial all-around contributor for the team.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that Elon Musk's rightward political turn and alignment with Donald Trump have soured U.S. liberals not only on Tesla but on electric vehicles in general. The study found that as liberals' opinion of Tesla plummeted, their overall intention to purchase any EV also declined, suggesting Musk's persona has become synonymous with the entire product category. Conversely, the shift has not led to a corresponding increase in EV purchase intent among conservatives, who largely remain skeptical of the technology.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly increased its 2025 economic growth forecast for China, marking the largest upward revision for any economy in its latest report. The IMF credits this positive outlook to stronger-than-expected economic activity in the first half of the year and China's successful strategy to diversify its export markets. By increasing trade with regions like Southeast Asia and Europe, China has effectively offset a decline in shipments to the U.S. amid ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ground search operation is underway in northern Pakistan for German Olympic biathlon champion Laura Dahlmeier, who went missing two days ago after being caught in a rockslide. The 31-year-old was ascending the 6,069-meter Laila Peak when the accident occurred, leaving her seriously injured and inaccessible at a high altitude. Rescue efforts, which include international climbers, have been severely hampered by adverse weather conditions, and there has been no confirmation of her current condition.</p>

          <p>German sportswear giant Adidas has announced it will raise prices for its products in the United States to offset the financial impact of new U.S. tariffs.

          <p>President Trump's unprecedented and public criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, has intensified concerns about the central bank's political independence. This analysis explores the historical context of presidential pressure on the Fed, noting that while not new, Trump's tactics are uniquely aggressive. Experts warn that undermining the Fed's autonomy, which is crucial for economic stability, risks politicizing monetary policy and could lead to poor long-term outcomes like the high inflation seen in the 1970s.

          <p>Health experts are cautioning that millions of Americans taking common medications for conditions like high blood pressure, depression, or allergies may face an increased risk of overheating during heatwaves. Certain drugs can interfere with the body's natural cooling mechanisms, such as sweating or the sensation of thirst. Doctors stress that patients should continue their prescribed treatments but must take extra precautions to stay cool and hydrated, as their bodies may not respond to extreme heat as effectively.</p>

          <p>The "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, promoted by Trump administration officials like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is facing criticism for rhetoric that some patients and medical groups say unfairly blames individuals for their health problems. This article details how officials have linked conditions such as autism, diabetes, and obesity to personal lifestyle choices, a stance critics argue fosters stigma and ignores systemic factors like poverty and environmental exposures. This viewpoint is also influencing policy decisions, including those on Medicaid and obesity drug coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on Great Tits, a common European songbird, has found that some avian couples effectively "divorce" after their breeding duties are complete. Using radio tags to track their movements, scientists observed that while many pairs remained together through the winter, others began to drift apart and associate less with each other. This behavior suggests that these birds are not just randomly flocking but are actively managing their social relationships, ditching their exes to potentially form new bonds for the next season.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Center for Election Innovation & Research (CEIR) confirms that voting by non-U.S. citizens in federal elections is a minuscule problem, directly contradicting claims made by some politicians. After reviewing public disclosures from states across the country, the research found that instances of noncitizen voting are extremely rare and typically result from bureaucratic mistakes or misunderstandings, not coordinated fraud.

          <p>This article explores the fascinating and long history of the word "dude," revealing its origins are far from its modern laid-back connotation. The term was likely coined in the 1880s to mock overly fashionable and effeminate young men in New York City, drawing a parallel to the pretentious "Yankee Doodle." It later evolved through its association with city dwellers visiting "dude ranches" out West before being adopted by various subcultures and eventually becoming the ubiquitous, gender-neutral term of solidarity it is today.</p>
