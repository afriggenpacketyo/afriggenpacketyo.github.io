          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado asserts that Venezuela is in "profound, total chaos" under President Nicolás Maduro, advocating for his removal. Machado, who was barred from running in the 2024 election, backed opposition candidate Edmundo González and claims a rigged vote denied their landslide victory. She accuses Maduro of operating a criminal structure, turning Venezuela into a safe haven for U.S. adversaries like Iran and Russia, and destabilizing the region. Machado expressed gratitude for U.S. President Trump's support in recognizing the threat Maduro presents, highlighting the need for strength and freedom to end impunity and save lives in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday to finalize the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire agreement. This truce, brokered by US President Donald Trump, took effect Friday and involves Hamas releasing Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. Starmer plans to commend Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and Trump for their pivotal roles, stressing the need for continued international coordination to secure the ceasefire and progress towards the deal's subsequent, more complex phases. The summit aims to end the two-year conflict, strengthen Middle East stability, and address critical issues such as Gaza's future governance and Hamas's disarmament.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the former Lostprophets singer, has died following an attack in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for child sexual offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. West Yorkshire Police have since arrested two men on suspicion of murder. Watkins, 48, was incarcerated in December 2013 for a string of offenses, and this incident follows a recent report that highlighted a significant increase in violence and safety concerns for older men convicted of sexual offenses within the prison. His death marks a somber conclusion to a life defined by heinous crimes and a noted lack of remorse during his sentencing.</p>

          <p>China has launched a commercial underwater data center in Hainan, a significant step in its bid for AI leadership. However, an opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships could thwart China's plans. The US, through the Trump administration, has fostered multi-billion-dollar deals to advance chip supplies to the UAE, supporting the construction of the Stargate UAE AI data center. This initiative aims to integrate major UAE institutions into a US-technology-based digital ecosystem. The article argues that the US's ability to pool resources with chipmakers and its growing convergence between investment and supply chain demands for companies like Nvidia pose a significant challenge to China's near-term data center industry dominance.

The rally also highlighted anger towards Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for perceived failures in preventing the October 7 attack and securing earlier hostage releases, as Hamas mobilizes fighters in northern Gaza amid fears of internal violence.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, is receiving radiation and hormone therapy for prostate cancer, his spokesman confirmed. Diagnosed in May with an aggressive, hormone-sensitive form of the disease that had spread to his bones, Biden's radiation treatment began a few weeks ago and is expected to last five weeks. A person close to Biden reported he is responding well. Having left office as the oldest US president, health concerns followed his term, leading him to end his re-election bid. Biden, who lost his eldest son to brain cancer, has long advocated for cancer research and relaunched the "cancer moonshot" initiative.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been officially retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary in rural Buckinghamshire following injuries sustained during a dramatic runaway incident in London last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses that were spooked by construction noise, causing them to gallop five miles through the capital, resulting in injuries to four pedestrians and five soldiers. The horse suffered a broken bone and serious bleeding, making him unable to return to ceremonial duties. His retirement ensures his long-term welfare and marks a peaceful conclusion for an animal involved in a widely publicized and chaotic event.</p>

          <h2>Smithsonian Museums and National Zoo Announce Closure Due to Government Shutdown</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Smithsonian museums, research centers, and the National Zoo are scheduled to close their doors starting Sunday, as the ongoing federal government shutdown has exhausted their prior-year operating funds. This significant closure affects all 21 Smithsonian sites, which rely on federal funding for approximately 62% of their budget, allowing them to offer free public admission. Although popular animal cams will be temporarily suspended, the Smithsonian has assured the public that all animals at the Zoo and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute will continue to receive comprehensive care. This development highlights the broad and tangible consequences of the government funding dispute, with other national parks also experiencing closures and staff furloughs.</p>

          <p>A’ja Wilson has led the Las Vegas Aces to their third WNBA title in four years, achieving an unprecedented "quadruple crown" by winning the scoring title, MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP in the same season. This historic feat, unmatched in NBA or WNBA history, solidified her status as a potential greatest of all time. The Aces' journey included overcoming a mid-season slump and a record 53-point loss, sparked by Wilson's powerful call for accountability. Her leadership and dominant two-way play, especially in the finals, underscore her peerless impact, even as the league faces broader labor and revenue-sharing discussions.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in central London for a march and rally, a day after a Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect. Organized by the Palestine Coalition, demonstrators carried Palestinian flags and slogans like "stop arming Israel" and "free Palestine." A small group of counter-protesters also gathered, leading to some arrests. While speakers acknowledged the US-brokered ceasefire as positive, they deemed it "precarious" and insufficient, vowing to continue protesting until Palestinians achieve full freedom. This demonstration follows recent calls by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to consider further curbs on protest laws.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Private charter airline Verijet has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, leading to the cancellation of all its flights and leaving customers potentially stranded. The Vero Beach, Florida-based carrier amassed over $38.7 million in liabilities, including $10.5 million owed to jet card customers, and faced numerous lawsuits following the sudden death of its founder. Unlike Chapter 11, Chapter 7 bankruptcy means the company will proceed directly to liquidation, rather than restructuring. This incident follows a challenging year for the airline industry, with several other smaller carriers also ceasing operations due to financial difficulties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scottish National Party (SNP) members have backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum if the party wins a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney presented this approach as the most realistic path, citing the precedent set before the 2014 referendum. This endorsement came ahead of a proposal to treat the 2026 election as a de-facto independence vote. Despite UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's stance against another referendum, Swinney affirmed his commitment to delivering independence for Scotland, stressing the party will "win big" and secure Scotland's choice.</p>

          <h2>Gen Z Leads Pushback Against "Fast Furniture" in Favor of Sustainable Secondhand Decor</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gen Z consumers are increasingly rejecting "fast furniture" in favor of secondhand and refurbished items, driven by environmental awareness and a desire for emotional connection with their decor. This generation recognizes the massive carbon footprint of the furniture industry, where over 95% of consumed furniture is discarded annually, often due to cheap, mass-produced items designed for short lifecycles and difficult recycling. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest show skyrocketing interest in secondhand decor. Experts note that younger consumers value sustainability, budget constraints, and the personal investment required to restore older pieces, challenging the industry's reliance on disposable trends and new materials.</p>
