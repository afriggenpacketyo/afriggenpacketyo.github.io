The article underscores the need for mutual trust and concrete actions from the U.S. to facilitate meaningful discussions. If the U.S. fails to address these issues, it would undermine the potential for progress and raise questions about its commitment to resolving the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor, nominating him as ambassador to the United Nations. The move follows criticism of Waltz for mistakenly adding a journalist to a Signal chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz, while continuing his duties as America's top diplomat. Some officials suggest the Trump administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing the president to remove him completely. </p>

Akazawa is expected to offer a package of proposals to U.S. officials, including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans, as well as simplifying the safety and environmental screening process for imported cars.

A federal judge had previously blocked the administration's plan, citing violations of administrative procedures and potential racial bias. The administration argues that the law creating the program specifically bars judicial review of executive branch decisions regarding the designation or termination of a foreign state's protection.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will be manufactured in India as the company seeks to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The company is also shifting iPad production to Vietnam. Cook warned that tariffs could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the company's costs in the current quarter. While Apple is diversifying its supply chain, China will remain a key manufacturing hub for products sold outside of the United States. </p>

          <p>Cambodia continues to grapple with the deadly threat of landmines, a remnant of decades of conflict stemming from the Vietnam War. Millions of mines, cluster bombs, and unexploded ordnance still litter the Cambodian countryside. Organizations like Cambodia Self Help DeMining are working to clear these mines, but the process is dangerous and slow. While Cambodia had hoped to be mine-free by 2025, that goal is now unattainable, highlighting the long-lasting impact of past conflicts.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz implemented a "soda tax" on sugar-sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban signed by former Governor Jerry Brown. The tax adds 2 cents per ounce to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a certain calorie count. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute a new soda tax since the ban was enacted, leading to a battle between the city and the American Beverage Association. Proponents argue that the tax will combat the dangers of sugary drinks, while opponents claim it unfairly burdens working families.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine has been inconsistent, shifting his frustration between Ukraine's leader and Vladimir Putin.

However, recent developments suggest a potential shift, with Trump growing increasingly frustrated with Putin's demands and analysts noting a more positive outlook for Ukraine.
