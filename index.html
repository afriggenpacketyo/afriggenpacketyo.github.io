          <p>Jurors have started deliberating in the high-profile sex trafficking and racketeering trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces a potential life sentence if convicted on the most severe charges. The jury will review seven weeks of testimony, including graphic accounts from former girlfriends and video evidence of sexual encounters and a physical assault. Prosecutors argued Combs used his power, wealth, and violence to coerce victims, while the defense maintained the sexual acts were consensual and that accusers were motivated by money. The trial's outcome now rests on the jury's interpretation of the extensive and often disturbing evidence presented.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case next term challenging the constitutionality of federal limits on coordinated campaign spending by political parties. The Republican National Senatorial and Congressional Committees argue that these caps, which restrict how much a party can spend in coordination with its candidates, violate the First Amendment. Democrats have vowed to defend the existing laws, stating their removal would upend the campaign finance system and allow wealthy donors to drown out grassroots support. The court's decision could significantly alter campaign finance rules ahead of the 2026 midterm elections by potentially allowing unlimited coordinated expenditures.</p>

          <p>This article provides a tactical analysis of England's recent Test match victory over India, highlighting the pivotal role of fast bowler Josh Tongue. It explains that Tongue's aggressive and intimidating bowling style was instrumental in quickly dismissing India's lower-order batsmen, a traditional weakness for England. The author, a former player, uses personal anecdotes to illustrate the psychological pressure effective tail-end bowling creates. The piece argues that this ability to 'kill the tail' is a vital, often-underestimated skill that will be imperative for England's future success, particularly in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new voter outreach program called "Organizing Summer" to regain momentum following losses in the 2024 elections. With an initial six-figure investment, the effort aims to mobilize thousands of volunteers to connect with voters in non-traditional settings and provide direct feedback to inform party strategy. The initiative will focus on key 2025 and 2026 races, seeking to counter the Republican agenda and rebuild the party's brand after recent internal disputes.

          <p>Conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus are signaling strong opposition to the Senate's version of President Trump's major legislative package, primarily over fiscal concerns. They argue the Senate bill adds an estimated $1.3 trillion to the federal deficit, a stark contrast to the House-passed version's $72 billion increase. The group has warned that without significant changes to reduce spending, the bill may not have enough support to pass the House. This intra-party disagreement over fiscal policy and the national debt presents a significant hurdle for Republican leadership aiming to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has become a prominent opponent of his own party's major spending bill, citing its deep cuts to Medicaid. In a fiery floor speech, Tillis argued the legislation breaks President Trump's promise to protect the program and would harm over 600,000 of his constituents. His opposition, which led him to announce he will not seek reelection after Trump threatened a primary challenge, highlights a significant rift within the GOP. While Tillis has vowed not to undermine his party's leadership, his stand puts pressure on Senate Republicans who hold a razor-thin majority.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order terminating the U.S. sanctions program on Syria, a move the White House says is intended to support the nation's path toward stability. The order will lift broad economic sanctions but maintain targeted penalties on former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and others linked to human rights abuses, terrorism, and chemical weapons. The decision follows months of lobbying by Syria's new transitional government, which has argued that the sanctions have crippled its ability to rebuild and provide basic services after the country's long civil war.</p>

          <p>A deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Damascus has left Syria's Christian minority feeling increasingly unsafe under the country's new Islamist-led government. The attack, which killed 25 worshippers, was the first of its kind since the end of the civil war and has shattered the sense of protection the community felt under the previous regime. Despite pledges of protection from the new government, many Christians, including survivors of the attack, now fear for their future in the country. The incident has intensified concerns about sectarian violence and the government's ability to control extremist elements.</p>

          <p>A key provision within the massive Republican budget package would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for service workers like waiters and bartenders. The White House has promoted the proposal as a major tax cut for the working class, but the plan has drawn criticism for its limitations. The tax break would be temporary, expiring in 2028, and versions of the bill include income caps for eligibility. Policy analysts note that over a third of tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income tax anyway, meaning the benefit would not reach the lowest earners while primarily helping middle and some high earners.</p>

The administration cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the original plan to decommission the system.

          <p>Police in the UK have opened a criminal investigation into performances by the bands Bob Vylan and Kneecap at the Glastonbury Festival. The inquiry follows widespread criticism of Bob Vylan's set, during which the singer led a chant of "death to the IDF," which the BBC and festival organizers condemned as antisemitic. The US visas for the members of Bob Vylan have since been revoked. The investigation will also assess the performance of Irish-language rap group Kneecap, who are known for their pro-Palestinian and controversial political commentary, adding to the intense scrutiny over political expression at the event.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Sharp Rise in ICE Detentions of Immigrants Without Criminal Records</h2>

          <p>A data analysis reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detentions of immigrants with no criminal history have spiked dramatically since May. This shift coincides with a White House push for higher daily arrest targets. While the Trump administration has stated its focus is on deporting criminals, the data shows that non-criminal detentions have more than doubled criminal ones since early June. Furthermore, of all detainees with criminal records, only about 8% had convictions for violent crimes. The findings suggest a disconnect between public rhetoric focusing on dangerous criminals and the reality of current enforcement actions.</p>
