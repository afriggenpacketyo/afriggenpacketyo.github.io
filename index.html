          <p>Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda stated that many market participants view continued reductions in government bond purchases as suitable while the central bank normalizes policy. During a mid-May meeting, there were limited requests to revise the current reduction plan through March 2026. The BOJ will discuss the planned purchase reduction at its next policy meeting later this month to gradually shrink its balance sheet. Ueda mentioned that the BOJ will not raise its policy rate unless economic and price conditions are expected to improve, citing uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development sharply reduced its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to President Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to 1.6% for this year and 1.5% in 2026, citing fallout from Trump's tariffs, economic policy uncertainty, and a slowdown in net immigration. Global growth is also expected to be lower than previously forecast, particularly in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The OECD chief economist noted that trade and economic policy uncertainty have reached unprecedented levels, leading to decreased consumption, investment, and activity indicators.

Sylejmani, originally from Kosovo, engaged in at least one battle against U.S.-led coalition forces after entering Syria a decade ago. He pleaded guilty in December to one count of receiving military training from a foreign terrorist organization. Prosecutors stated that Sylejmani pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and received training on various weapons, while his attorneys claim he is not a committed jihadist and wishes to live a law-abiding life with his family.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has found that it is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission's interim findings highlight shaken public trust due to pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The review calls for clearer direction from the government, improved long-term investment, and a stronger voice for local communities, while also suggesting potential streamlining of regulators. The review considered over 50,000 responses from the public, environmental groups, regulators, and the water industry.</p>

          <p>Fashion brand The North Face and luxury jeweller Cartier have recently reported customer data theft due to cyber attacks. The North Face indicated that hackers used a technique called "credential stuffing" to access usernames, passwords, shipping addresses, and purchase histories. Cartier reported that an unauthorized party gained temporary access to their system, obtaining limited client information, though passwords and card details were not accessed. Retailers are increasingly becoming targets of cyber attacks, with other high-profile companies like Adidas and Victoria's Secret also reporting recent incidents.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation dropped to a cooler-than-expected 1.9% in May, falling below the European Central Bank's 2% target due to sharp declines in services.

The latest figures will be considered by the ECB as it prepares to make its next interest rate decision later this week, with markets pricing in a high chance of an interest rate cut.

The men had been ordered to pay restitution and faced restrictions on voting, owning firearms, and international travel due to the felony convictions. Moore and Mansell spotted the longline off the Jupiter Inlet in August 2020 and, believing it was illegal, freed the marine animals and reported it to state wildlife officials.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has cautioned that global economic growth is set to slow this year due to President Trump's tariffs. Worldwide growth is now expected to be a "modest" 2.9%, a decrease from the previous forecast of 3.1%. The OECD attributed the downgrade to a "significant" rise in trade barriers and warned that "weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception".

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search in Portugal related to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann nearly two decades ago. The search is focused on 21 different plots of land in the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz, where Madeleine was last seen. German investigators, who have identified Christian BrÃ¼ckner as their prime suspect, are leading the search. BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate crime and denies any involvement in McCann's disappearance.</p>

          <p>England rugby players who participate in the prospective new breakaway league, R360, will risk becoming ineligible for the national side. The competition, scheduled to launch next year, aims to attract the game's biggest stars with significant investment. However, under the terms of the new Professional Game Partnership (PGP), the Rugby Football Union is contractually obligated to only select players who play in the Premiership. This means any player quitting the Premiership to compete in R360 risks curtailing their international career.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay by Adam Tooze discusses the growing concerns surrounding the $29 trillion market for U.S. Treasuries. The article highlights the intersection of macroeconomics and politics in the Treasury market, emphasizing the roles of inflation, Congress's ability to balance the budget, and the Federal Reserve's power to set interest rates. The author notes increasing jitters in the Treasury market due to the scale of Republican deficits, the refusal to raise revenue, and efforts to depreciate the dollar, suggesting potential risks to the value of U.S. debt.

          <p>The future of electric vehicle (EV) tax credits in the U.S. is uncertain due to the Republican megabill passed by the House of Representatives. The bill includes significant cuts to tax credits designed to incentivize EV purchases, potentially affecting new car buyers as early as next year. The consumer tax credit for new EVs would phase out after 2026, while the tax credit for used vehicles would be eliminated at the end of 2025. Automakers have warned that removing these subsidies could exacerbate affordability issues and put manufacturing investments at risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from FWD.us estimates that having a loved one in prison or jail costs families across the U.S. nearly $350 billion annually. The report, in partnership with researchers at Duke University and NORC, surveyed over 1,600 people and conducted focus groups to identify various costs associated with incarceration. These costs include expenses for phone calls, visits, commissary purchases, and lost income before and after incarceration. The report emphasizes that these financial burdens disproportionately affect families who can least afford them.</p>
