          <p>The Trump administration is set to revoke the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. Nvidia shares rose following the announcement, with the company expressing its support for the administration's new direction on AI policy, stating it will allow America to lead the next industrial revolution and create high-paying U.S. jobs. The rule, proposed by the Biden administration, would have organized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on AI chip exports, and was scheduled to take effect on May 15. Optimism is high that this move will stimulate technological innovation and economic growth.</p>

While Trump touted the agreement as a done deal on Truth Social, 10 Downing Street indicated that negotiations were still ongoing. The UK is affected by separate U.S. tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum, and foreign-made cars, and this deal may signal a broader shift in trade policy.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most of the claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including stars like Tom Brady, Gisele B√ºndchen, Kevin O'Leary, and Stephen Curry. The ruling narrows the scope of a multidistrict litigation accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's catastrophic collapse in November 2022, which wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds and triggered investigations worldwide.</p>

          <p>The House is voting on a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill, introduced by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, faces pushback from some Republicans. Democrats have criticized the effort as a waste of taxpayer dollars. The White House has restricted Associated Press reporters' access to events over the news organization's decision to refer to the Gulf by its original name.</p>

The automaker forecasts an operating profit of 3.8 trillion yen, a 20.8% decrease from fiscal 2024, despite estimated record sales of 48.5 trillion yen, which would be a 1.0% increase.</p>

          <p>Two new histories of American intelligence explore the question of whether espionage is compatible with American ideals, with one suggesting that the business of intelligence is inherently "un-American." George Washington is cast as the nation‚Äôs first great spymaster, but the decision to involve the United States in espionage aroused little public opposition for decades. The CIA was established in 1947, but its forays into regime change and assassination damaged the American government‚Äôs reputation abroad and its standing at home. President Trump's conspiratorial view of intelligence appears not so different from that held by many other Baby Boomers.</p>
