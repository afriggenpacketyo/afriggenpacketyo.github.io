          <p>OpenAI is discontinuing its work with Scale AI, an AI startup recently backed by Meta, as Scale AI's founder joins Meta to spearhead AI efforts. OpenAI cites a need for data providers that are more aligned with current innovation and model requirements. Google is also reportedly severing ties with Scale AI following the Meta deal. Meta's investment in Scale AI amounts to $14.3 billion for a 49% stake, though without voting power. This shift underscores the intense competition for AI talent and resources among major tech companies. The article highlights Meta's efforts to enhance its AI capabilities amidst lukewarm responses to its Llama AI models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law that restricts gender-affirming care for minors, ruling 6-3 that the law does not violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. The decision is expected to have broad implications for access to medical treatments for transgender youth in numerous states. Chief Justice John Roberts stated that the court's role is not to judge the wisdom or fairness of the law, but only to ensure it does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Dissenting justices argued that the law discriminates against transgender adolescents and conditions the availability of medications on the patient's sex, causing untold harm to transgender children and their families.</p>

          <p>Kasem Abu al-Hija, a 67-year-old resident of Tamra, Israel, expresses his anger after an Iranian missile strike killed four of his family members, including his daughter and granddaughters. The incident has exposed a divide in Israeli society, particularly regarding the lack of public bomb shelters in Arab-majority towns like Tamra, contrasting with the abundance of shelters in nearby Jewish-majority towns. Residents of Tamra have long raised concerns about this disparity, especially given the town's vulnerability to rockets fired by Hezbollah. This tragedy underscores broader issues of state discrimination and unequal rights experienced by Israeli Arabs, who make up a fifth of the country's population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report indicates that the trust fund Social Security relies on to pay retirement benefits may be depleted by 2033. At that point, only 77% of scheduled benefits would be payable, highlighting the program's looming financial challenges. The combined trust funds are projected to be able to pay scheduled benefits and administrative costs until 2034, one year earlier than previously projected. These projections underscore the need for potential reforms to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare, which also faces its own financial crunch.</p>

          <p>As Senate Republicans aim to pass President Trump's spending bill, key provisions such as the child tax credit are subject to change during Senate-House negotiations. The Senate bill proposes a permanent increase of the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025, indexed for inflation, while the House-approved bill suggests a boost to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, reverting to $2,000 thereafter. Policy experts note that neither version would significantly benefit the lowest-earning families, with most of the increase going to middle and upper-income families. The final provision remains uncertain, but changes are expected before Trump signs the package into law.</p>

          <p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor has issued a strong dissent against the Supreme Court's decision to uphold a Tennessee law banning specific transgender medical treatments for minors. Sotomayor argued that the 6-3 decision improperly discriminates against minors based on their sex. She stated that the majority "obfuscates a sex classification" to allow the Tennessee bill to withstand constitutional tests. The decision effectively allows states to ban certain medical treatments for minors, a move Sotomayor warns will cause "untold harm" to transgender children and their families.</p>

          <p>Social Security is now projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, potentially leading to a 19% cut in benefits. The change is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to act quickly to shore up the program, either by raising more revenue or cutting benefits. One method to raise revenue would be to lift the income cap, which currently exempts earnings over $176,100 from payroll tax.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that mothers overwhelmingly carry the majority of the mental workload at home, managing 71% of family tasks such as planning and organizing. This cognitive overload can lead to persistent feelings of anxiety, sleep disturbances, and increased irritability. Experts emphasize the importance of partners being part of the conversation to ease this invisible load by initiating household tasks and engaging in open communication. Partners can help by taking responsibility for specific tasks and showing appreciation for the work that women do, especially those who are caregivers.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, marking a setback for transgender rights. The conservative-dominated court voted 6-3 in favor of the Republican-backed ban on hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and gender transition surgery for patients under 18. Chief Justice John Roberts stated that Tennessee had concluded there is an ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks and benefits of such treatments.

          <p>Caroline Fraser's new book, Murderland, argues that the rise of serial killing in the Pacific Northwest has deep roots in industrial waste, specifically the release of lead and arsenic into the environment. The book connects elevated lead presence to increased crime rates and draws a parallel between the phasing out of leaded gasoline and the subsequent drop in violent crime. However, the book is criticized for the "Bundy Problem," where the focus on Ted Bundy overshadows the larger environmental thesis. The question remains if pollution was nationwide, why was there a serial-killing cluster specifically in the Pacific Northwest?</p>
