          <p>Many UK newspapers are covering Chancellor Rachel Reeves's reversal on winter fuel payments, with some calling for an apology and others highlighting potential tax rises. The Daily Express celebrated the change as a victory for pensioners after relentless campaigning. The Times reported a standoff between Reeves and the Home Secretary over police funding, potentially impacting crime investigations. Several papers also highlighted Labour's pledge to invest £14bn in the Sizewell C nuclear plant to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create jobs, with the Energy Secretary calling it a new "golden age" for the British nuclear industry.</p>

          <p>Kyiv is experiencing a relentless barrage of drones and missiles, with near-constant explosions reported across the city. Dozens of drones were launched towards the Ukrainian capital, and while many were intercepted, some struck targets, causing fires in multiple districts. Authorities have confirmed at least two injuries as a result of the overnight attacks. This assault follows a massive drone strike across Ukraine the previous day, marking one of the largest aerial offensives of the war. Earlier in the day, Russia and Ukraine conducted the initial phase of a prisoner exchange agreed upon during peace talks in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about the UK's potential complicity in Israel's actions in Gaza were advised to consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff questioned continued arms sales and perceived disregard for international law. Senior civil servants responded that while healthy challenge was encouraged, resignation was an honorable option for those with deep disagreements. This response has sparked outrage among some officials who feel the space for dissent is shrinking, with some fearing liability in future legal proceedings against the UK government.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key factors. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The report notes that financial limitations are a significant barrier, with 39% of respondents citing this as a reason. The UNFPA is taking a stronger stance on low fertility issues, emphasizing that many people feel unable to create the families they want.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. Provisional CDC data indicates that fatal overdoses among people under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. Despite this progress, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and concerns exist about potential cuts to funding for addiction services.</p>
