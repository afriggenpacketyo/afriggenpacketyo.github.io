          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, keeping a lower court's order in place. The ruling upholds an injunction issued by a California judge, who questioned the legality of the administration's efforts to downsize the federal workforce, spearheaded by Elon Musk through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The court stated that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration has sought to remake the federal government, resulting in the termination or resignation of tens of thousands of federal workers, but this ruling maintains the pause on these actions, pending further legal proceedings. The Optimism score reflects the stability of the legal process.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has praised a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting that the U.S. steelmaker will remain "controlled by the USA" despite the merger. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump announced Nippon Steel would invest $14 billion in the company, including significant investments in Pittsburgh and other states. He also announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel headquarters would stay in Pittsburgh, promising no layoffs or outsourcing and a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. steelworker. The President's support for the deal marks a shift from his previous opposition to the acquisition, and he portrayed himself as a skilled dealmaker.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he is doubling tariffs on foreign steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, while also celebrating a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. He declared the tariff increase would further secure the steel industry in the United States. The announcement comes after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed his tariffs to remain in effect, staying a decision by a US trade court that blocked the president from imposing the duties. The precise relationship between Nippon Steel and US Steel raised questions, even for some of Trumpâ€™s allies, as the president has thrown his full support behind the deal months after opposing it.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to reinstate an "asset test" to limit eligibility for Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services, potentially impacting millions of low-income and disabled residents. The proposal aims to address rising costs in these programs by requiring recipients to prove their assets total less than $2,000, including the value of their primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. Disability and health advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing it would result in people losing coverage and force older adults and people with disabilities into extreme poverty. Newsom defends the cuts as necessary to balance the budget, but advocates warn of increased costs in the long run due to worsening health conditions.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk lashed out at a Fox News reporter in the Oval Office when questioned about a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use during the 2024 campaign. Musk dismissed the report by questioning the credibility of the New York Times, while standing alongside President Trump during a send-off marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration. The Times reported Musk used ketamine as often as once a day in 2024, affecting his bladder, and has used ecstasy and magic mushrooms at times. Musk's role as a "special government employee" overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) concludes, with the administration praising his efforts to cut federal contracts and staff.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey has indicated that UK defence spending is expected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, aligning with the Prime Minister's plan to increase spending to 2.5% by April 2027. The strategic defence review, to be published on Monday, assumes that the 3% target is the trajectory spending will follow. The review will recommend the deployment of new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and to control the army's own, future, unmanned weapons. New money for defence will be found in part by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is warning people to beware of scam websites claiming to sell rice at heavily discounted prices as rice prices soar. Complaints related to such websites have spiked since March, with some claiming the rice was never delivered though payment had been made. The center called on consumers to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid buying from websites that sell rice at unrealistically low prices. The warning comes as the average price of rice at supermarkets has risen steadily in recent months due partly to a poor harvest, hitting a record 4,285 yen per 5 kg in mid-May, roughly double last year's level.</p>

Authorities are urging the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, while more than two dozen beekeepers are assisting with the rescue efforts. The goal is to save as many of the bees as possible, with authorities working to re-hive the bees and find their queen bee. The road where the truck overturned will be closed for 24 to 48 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and those responsible for their delivery will be in charge.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation and higher prices, impacting visitor numbers and hotel occupancy rates. While convention traffic remains strong, the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip has increased, and the city is seeing fewer international visitors who tend to spend more. Heavy vehicle traffic due to construction and road closures is also deterring some tourists. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals, and sporting events, and industry leaders remain optimistic about the city's resilience.</p>

          <p>A US-Israeli backed Gaza aid plan, operated by the newly created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has turned to chaos, with distribution centers overrun by desperate civilians and reports of armed security contractors using non-lethal deterrents.

The GHF aims to feed one million Gazans in its first week of operations, but communication has been disorganized and misinformation has spread. Aid agencies have criticized the location of the GHF distribution sites and the presence of armed security, undermining faith in aid operations.</p>

Professional medical groups such as the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to recommend COVID vaccines to children and pregnant women based on scientific evidence.
