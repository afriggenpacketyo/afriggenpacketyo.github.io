          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against the City of Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu, and the police commissioner, challenging the city's sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed by the Trump administration, alleges that Boston is violating federal law by refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The administration contends that these policies, specifically the Boston Trust Act, endanger public safety by preventing the detention of individuals for immigration authorities. Mayor Wu has previously defended the city's stance, stating that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, not a municipal one.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, has raised concerns about the adoption of agentic artificial intelligence browsers within corporate environments. While acknowledging the consumer appeal of AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks like booking travel, he argues that enterprises will likely prohibit their use without robust security controls. Arora predicts that within 24 months, companies will block these browsers due to the security risks associated with AI agents having access to user credentials and operating with significant autonomy. He emphasized the importance of identity security, linking it to his company's planned acquisition of CyberArk.</p>

          <p>A unique preparatory high school, the first of its kind in a major U.S. city, has opened in Queens, New York, with a curriculum focused on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The school aims to increase student exposure to HBCUs, which are predominantly located in the southern United States. Students at the HBCU Early College Prep will be able to earn up to 64 college credits for an associate's degree from Delaware State University (DSU) and are guaranteed admission there. The initiative, supported by Mayor Eric Adams, seeks to create a new educational pathway and build on the legacy of HBCUs in fostering academic excellence.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has published her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," which delves into the raw and turbulent relationship with her late mother, Mary Roy. The book portrays Mary Roy as a formidable and contradictory figure—a feminist icon, educator, and crusader who was also a source of both shelter and storm for her daughter. Rather than a hagiography, the memoir is a candid exploration of a complex mother-daughter bond, which Roy describes as a "respectful relationship between two nuclear powers." The narrative chronicles her challenging upbringing and how these experiences shaped her as a writer.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has seen a series of strategic debate challenges, escalating the political dynamics among the candidates. Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for five debates with Democrat Zohran Mamdani, who in turn challenged President Trump to a debate, labeling Cuomo as Trump's "puppet." This development occurs amid reports that the Trump administration is attempting to persuade incumbent Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to exit the race, creating a direct contest between Cuomo and Mamdani.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense bipartisan questioning during a Senate hearing regarding recent turmoil at the CDC and his controversial vaccine policies. Key moments included his defense of firing former CDC Director Susan Monarez, whom he accused of lying, and his clashes with senators over changes that have complicated public access to COVID-19 vaccines. Several Republican senators joined Democrats in challenging Kennedy's actions and his rhetoric surrounding vaccine safety.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a strategic financial move based on "mathematics." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the substantial draft capital received in the trade allows the team to allocate salary cap space to multiple high-quality players instead of concentrating it on one individual. He emphasized that the trade allows for greater roster depth and flexibility, mitigating the risk of a single player's potential injury.</p>

Homeowners should first accurately assess how much equity they can actually borrow, as lenders have limits, and determine if their financial needs are urgent enough to justify borrowing at current rates. It is also important to weigh the benefits of securing a loan now against the possibility of lower rates in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

This dominance reinforces the greenback's role in the digital economy, running counter to China's long-term goal of de-dollarization and promoting the yuan. While stablecoins offer efficiency, their reliance on the U.S. financial system could undermine China's efforts to establish its own digital currency and maintain capital controls.

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal battle over presidential power by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the removal of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. This request follows lower court rulings that blocked President Trump's attempt to fire her, citing federal laws that provide tenure protections to members of certain independent regulatory agencies. The Justice Department argues that the modern FTC wields more substantial power than it did when a 1935 precedent was set, and therefore its commissioners should serve at the president's will. The case represents a significant challenge to the independence of federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, announced it will begin testing its driverless robotaxis at San Jose Mineta International Airport this fall. This marks the company's first airport testing site in California, with plans to offer paid rides to the public later in the year. The service will allow passengers to be picked up from the airport's ground transportation centers and travel to destinations within Waymo's San Francisco Bay service area. This expansion follows the successful launch of a similar service at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become a popular destination for Waymo riders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have been on a slow but steady downward trend in 2025, providing some relief for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For example, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen from over 7% in January to 6.50% in early September. While rates are not as low as they were at the start of the decade, the consistent decline is an encouraging sign for the housing market. Further drops are possible, contingent on the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions and the performance of the 10-year Treasury yield. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wildfire, part of the TCU September Lightning Complex in California's Sierra Nevada foothills, has caused significant damage to the historic town of Chinese Camp. The town, founded by Chinese miners around 1849 during the Gold Rush, was home to nearly 100 residents who were forced to evacuate. Flames have reportedly consumed several historic buildings in the state historical landmark, which was known for its preserved 19th-century atmosphere. For historians and residents, the fire represents a heartbreaking loss of a tangible connection to California's past, a place described as a "living ghost town."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service has temporarily shut down a post office in Torrance, California, after tests revealed asbestos contamination within the facility. As a precautionary measure, thousands of pieces of mail and packages that were inside the building are being destroyed in accordance with federal and state regulations.

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Florida's surgeon general has announced the elimination of all vaccine mandates for children attending school, making it the first state in the nation to do so. The decision has been framed by officials as a matter of individual and parental rights regarding bodily autonomy. The move has drawn sharp criticism from public health experts who warn that removing established immunization requirements could lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. This policy change aligns with the broader anti-vaccine mandate sentiment championed by national figures like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

The move is part of a broader effort to support Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa's "war" on organized crime, as the country has become a major transit hub for cocaine.

The San Francisco 49ers topped the league with $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, significantly higher than the league average. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tennessee Titans ranked last with $81.2 million. The report also details how teams contribute 34% of their ticket revenue to a shared pool, known as the visiting team's share, which is then largely redistributed equally to all teams to promote financial parity.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating California's privacy laws by improperly tracking smartphone users. The class-action lawsuit, which covered approximately 98 million U.S. smartphones, argued that Google continued to collect user data even when privacy controls were activated. The plaintiffs' lawyers contended that Google illegally used this data to sell targeted ads, generating billions in revenue. Despite the verdict, Google has denied any wrongdoing, stating the decision misunderstands how its products work, and has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Michael Schill has announced he is stepping down as president of Northwestern University after a three-year tenure marked by significant challenges. His resignation follows a period of intense scrutiny from Republican lawmakers over the university's handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests, which they alleged were antisemitic. This pressure culminated in the Trump administration freezing nearly $800 million in federal research funding, a move that forced the university to eliminate over 400 staff positions. In his statement, Schill acknowledged the extraordinary challenges and stated that it was the right time for new leadership.</p>
