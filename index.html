            <p>A federal judge has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing the implementation of a mandate requiring all migrants without legal status to register with the federal government. Immigration groups had filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that the rule is confusingly written and would cause chaos. Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, determined that the advocacy organizations lacked the legal standing to succeed in their challenge, thus permitting the rule to take effect. This decision marks a significant development in the ongoing debate over immigration enforcement policies. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing substantial budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), potentially reducing its overall funding by more than 25%. These cuts would significantly impact NOAA's research operations and fisheries services, potentially setting back scientific progress by decades, according to former NOAA officials. Key areas affected include climate and weather research, marine fisheries management, and satellite technology investment.

However, rising Treasury yields and warnings from financial leaders like BlackRock's Larry Fink about a potential recession continue to cast a shadow over the market's long-term outlook.

            <p>The U.S. House education and workforce committee has withdrawn its investigation into Northwestern University’s law school clinics after professors sued, alleging the inquiry violated their constitutional free speech rights. The committee had sought budget and personnel records over claims that the university was using “taxpayer-supported institutional resources for troubling purposes,” citing reports of antisemitism on campus. The professors argued the investigation violated their and their clients’ constitutional rights to free speech and due process. The committee's withdrawal is seen as a victory for academic freedom.

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield topped 4.5% after a steep rise this week, causing concern on Wall Street and in the White House. The increase is attributed to President Trump's trade moves, which led investors to sell U.S. assets in favor of global safe havens. The move marks a reversal in how investors view Treasurys, traditionally seen as a safe haven during tumultuous times. The White House is closely monitoring the bond market, with officials acknowledging the potential impact of rising yields on the economy. Optimism score: 50 (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An immigration judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian organizer, is eligible to be deported from the United States based on his views.

Khalil's attorneys argued that the allegations violated his free speech rights. The ruling means that Khalil's removal proceedings will continue, while a separate case examines the legality of his detention. Optimism score: 15</p>
