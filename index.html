        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel has formally warned shareholders about potential "adverse reactions" following the Trump administration's acquisition of a 10% stake in the company. A significant concern is the impact on international sales, as 76% of Intel's revenue comes from outside the U.S., directly tying the company to President Trump's fluctuating tariff and trade policies. The deal, partially funded by the CHIPS Act, also introduces risks from a potentially changing political landscape in Washington, which could challenge or even void the agreement. Furthermore, the company acknowledged that the government's stake reduces existing shareholders' voting rights and may limit future beneficial transactions, while a full analysis of financial, tax, and accounting implications is still pending.

Gaudu outmaneuvered rivals on the final corner, finishing ahead of Mads Pedersen and Jonas Vingegaard, with the latter retaining the overall lead based on finishing places despite being level on time. The stage also saw Vingegaard's team report multiple bike thefts overnight from their mechanics' truck, prompting a police investigation. Additionally, a teammate's bike went missing after a crash, only to be later found in the broom wagon.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI, alongside his social network X, has initiated a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, alleging an "anticompetitive scheme" aimed at hindering artificial intelligence competitors. The lawsuit claims Apple systematically deprioritizes rival generative AI chatbots, such as xAI's Grok, within its App Store rankings, while concurrently favoring OpenAI by integrating its ChatGPT chatbot directly into Apple products. Filed in a U.S. District Court in Texas, the complaint asserts that Apple is actively colluding with OpenAI to maintain monopolies in both the smartphone and generative AI markets. OpenAI has dismissed the lawsuit as part of Musk's ongoing harassment, and Apple has yet to issue a public response.</p>

His presence fostered a strong sense of community, with many neighbors unaware he was "trick-or-treating" to every house. Billy's sudden death last month, likely from an alligator attack, deeply saddened the community, leading to an outpouring of memories online and a sunset toast and permanent memorial in his honor.</p>

          <p>Filming for the fifth season of Netflix's "Emily in Paris" has recommenced in Venice, only two days after the sudden death of assistant director Diego Borella, 47, who collapsed on location. Lead actress Lily Collins and other cast members were photographed on set, signaling the continuation of production. Paramount Television Studios confirmed Borella's passing, extending profound condolences to his family and loved ones during this difficult period. Borella, who was locally hired and trained in major cities, reportedly received treatment on set but could not be revived. The new season is slated for a December 18th premiere, with Collins having previously shared updates about the Italian adventure.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that great white sharks are spending considerably more time in the northern waters off New England and Canada's Atlantic coast, prompting increased awareness among boaters, beachgoers, and fishermen. Scientists link this surge in sightings to an increased availability of seals, which are a primary food source for the sharks. Maine, historically a rare location for these predators, has detected 93 unique white sharks since 2020, with 19 recorded in 2024 alone. While the number of sharks has increased, particularly off Nova Scotia, experts from the International Shark Attack File reiterate that fatal shark bites remain exceedingly rare, with Maine having only two confirmed unprovoked attacks since 1837.</p>

Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board, has vehemently denied the claims and vowed not to be "bullied."

The allure of the gamble encourages repeat purchases and trading, with some individuals dedicating substantial monthly funds to these collectibles. The trend has permeated diverse sectors, from souvenir shops at Confucius temples to travel agencies offering "blind box" flight tickets.

The Trust perceives this decline as an opportune moment, emphasizing Palo Alto Networks' robust quarterly results and the proven efficacy of its "platformization" strategy, which achieved a record in bundled service deals. Confidence in the CyberArk acquisition is rooted in CEO Nikesh Arora's strong deal-making background and the expected inflection in the identity security market driven by agentic AI within the next 12 to 24 months.

However, the heat is expected to dissipate quickly as the remnants of Hurricane Erin approach, forecast to bring wet and windy conditions, with gusts up to 40mph, across most of the UK by Tuesday.

          <p>Wolves have turned down a significant £50 million bid from Newcastle United for their Norwegian striker, Jorgen Strand Larsen. While Newcastle, actively seeking a center-forward after Callum Wilson's contract expired, might submit an improved offer, Wolves are reportedly firm in their stance against selling a crucial player, particularly given the limited time remaining in the transfer window to secure a replacement. Newcastle has faced similar rejections for Brentford's Yoane Wissa. Strand Larsen, who recently joined Wolves permanently for £23 million after a successful loan spell where he scored 14 goals, is deemed "very important" by manager Vitor Pereira, highlighting the challenge Newcastle faces in strengthening their squad.</p>

Artists, who are responsible for funding their own participation, frequently incur substantial financial losses, raising fears that the festival is becoming increasingly exclusive to established or wealthier talent.

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency following a significant rise in its infant mortality rate to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average and the highest in over a decade. The state aims to combat this crisis, particularly the stark racial disparity where Black infants die at more than twice the rate of White infants, by expanding prenatal services, establishing a regional obstetric care system, and bolstering home visiting programs. Public health experts emphasize that deeply entrenched structural inequities, rather than solely individual factors, are primary contributors. Compounding the issue are federal funding cuts to crucial maternal and infant health programs and Mississippi's continued refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which analysts warn could further destabilize rural healthcare and increase the uninsured rate.</p>

The order specifically instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether flag burners can be charged with alternative crimes, such as disturbing the peace or violating environmental laws. This directive represents an effort by the Trump administration to bypass the landmark 1989 Supreme Court decision in *Texas v. Johnson*, which established flag destruction as a form of protected political expression under the First Amendment. Trump, a long-time proponent of criminalizing flag burning, publicly stated his belief that such actions should incur consequences, despite the clear legal precedent affirming it as free speech.</p>

          <p>The latest Premier League weekend showcased notable tactical developments and exposed defensive vulnerabilities across several matches, with Manchester United's performance against Fulham being particularly illustrative. Fulham's manager, Marco Silva, ingeniously exploited United's defensive setup by generating numerical superiority in midfield and compelling United's center-backs to step out of their back five, thereby creating exploitable spaces. Concurrently, Manchester City's evolving high-press strategy, influenced by new assistant coach Pep Lijnders, demonstrated weaknesses against Tottenham, who effectively launched attacks down both flanks. Spurs' coordinated movements between wingers and midfielders successfully exposed City's persistent left-flank defensive issues, indicating a need for rectification. These observations highlight the ongoing tactical evolution and challenges faced by top-tier clubs in the league.</p>

These remarks precede a crucial meeting of Israel's security cabinet to deliberate on the latest truce proposal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt.
