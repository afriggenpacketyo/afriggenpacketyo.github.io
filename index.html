          <p>An aesthetic beautician in County Durham, England, has been identified as the source of illegal anti-wrinkle treatments that caused severe illness in multiple women, with one requiring life support. The practitioner, Gemma Gray, used an unlicensed South Korean product called Toxpia, leading to 28 diagnosed cases of botulism, a rare and life-threatening condition. Victims describe harrowing experiences, including difficulty breathing and temporary paralysis, after paying a discounted price for what they believed was Botox. An investigation by the UK Health Security Agency is currently underway into the matter.</p>

          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven individuals unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening in the rural community of Esparto, prompted mandatory evacuations and caused significant power outages. The initial blast created a smoke plume reaching up to 15,000 feet, and the resulting fires burned approximately 80 acres. Family members of the missing, some of whom were reportedly working their first day at the facility, are anxiously awaiting information from authorities as search and recovery efforts continue.</p>

The deal also includes a steeper 40% tariff on products that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries, like China, to avoid duties.

His music not only launched his own brief but brilliant career but also paved the way for future generations of Chicano artists. The piece also discusses the making of the 1987 film "La Bamba," which introduced his story and music to a new audience.</p>

Kennedy Jr., who has praised a legislative bill that would impose work requirements and other barriers to Medicaid access. Despite his stated mission to "make America healthy again," Kennedy supports a bill that the CBO estimates will cause nearly 12 million people to lose health insurance. The analysis argues that cutting Medicaid undermines Kennedy's own goals, as the program provides essential care for many of the sickest Americans and supports initiatives he champions, such as "food is medicine" programs.

          <p>The Pentagon is undertaking a comprehensive review of weapons deliveries to global allies, prompted by concerns over diminishing U.S. stockpiles of critical munitions like Patriot anti-air missiles. This review follows a White House confirmation that some arms shipments to Ukraine were being limited to prioritize American interests. The evaluation, which could affect other allies, comes after significant use of U.S. interceptor missiles in recent Middle East conflicts. Ukrainian officials have expressed concern that any delay in military aid could embolden Russia in the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood's CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, has warned that a massive Republican spending bill could be "existential" for the organization, potentially forcing the closure of nearly 200 health centers. The bill contains a provision that would block Medicaid funding for healthcare non-profits that also offer abortions, a move that would cost the group an estimated $700 million in federal funds. Since most of these clinics are in blue states with protected abortion access, the measure is being called a "backdoor abortion ban" that would gut the healthcare safety net for millions.

          <p>President Trump's signature tax and spending bill is facing significant headwinds in the House of Representatives due to deep divisions within the Republican party. Both conservative fiscal hawks in the Freedom Caucus and moderate members are opposing the Senate-passed version of the legislation. The conservatives are outraged by the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit, while moderates are concerned about steep cuts to social programs like Medicaid. This infighting has stalled the bill's progress, jeopardizing the president's goal of signing it into law by July 4th. (not investment advice)</p>

This shift challenges the conventional wisdom of U.S. housing markets, suggesting that factors like restrictive zoning and NIMBYism are creating a nationwide affordability crisis.

          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson has stated that recent U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities have likely set back the country's program by approximately one to two years. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's claims that the sites were completely "obliterated." The evaluation is based on evolving intelligence, including material suggesting the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The differing assessments highlight the ongoing debate and difficulty in precisely gauging the full impact of the military action on Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>As the Dalai Lama turns 90 and announces his succession plan, a report from inside Tibet reveals a climate of intense surveillance and repression. In the town of Aba, a historic center of Tibetan resistance, a heavy police presence and nests of cameras monitor daily life, and any public support for the spiritual leader is forbidden. The article describes how China's policies, including mandatory Mandarin education for children, are eroding Tibetan culture and faith. While the world discusses the future of Tibetan Buddhism, those within Tibet remain silent under the government's tight control.</p>
