          <p>The newly elected Canadian government is facing criticism over a border bill that critics say aligns Canada's policies with those of the United States, particularly regarding immigration and data access. Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act, grants extensive powers to the immigration minister to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake, potentially leading to mass deportations without appeal processes. The bill also enhances law enforcement's access to citizens' data and electronic information, raising concerns about privacy rights. Critics argue the legislation infringes on due process and constructs a surveillance state.</p>

          <p>This article examines the historical roots of the conflict between Iran and Israel, tracing the shift from allies before the 1979 Islamic Revolution to adversaries. The Iranian Revolution brought about a complete reversal of relations, with Ayatollah Khomeini criticizing Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Iran's support for Shiite militias, such as Hezbollah, further solidified the adversarial relationship, with the current Iranian leadership continuing to question the Holocaust. While some Iranians advocate for reassessing relations with Israel, staunch supporters of the Islamic Republic maintain a hostile stance.</p>

          <p>Japan is seeking special treatment in its trade negotiations with the United States, particularly concerning auto tariffs, as U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted at raising import levies on cars. Ryosei Akazawa, Tokyo's top negotiator, expressed confidence that Japan would receive unique consideration once a bilateral deal is finalized. Trump's threat to raise auto tariffs aims to attract more investment in American manufacturing, but it could significantly impact Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is visiting Washington to make progress in the talks ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump.</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, less than a month after it capsized during its initial launch attempt. Leader Kim Jong Un reportedly reacted strongly to the failed launch, demanding quick repairs.

Kim Jong Un oversaw the relaunch, emphasizing the importance of developing a nuclear-armed navy and plans to build more destroyers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the reasons behind Israel's decision to launch strikes on Iran now, suggesting that it stems from a perceived weakening of Iran's deterrent power and a shift in the political calculation regarding nuclear weapons. The author argues that Israel's actions have eroded Iran's ability to exert influence through regional proxies, making it more vulnerable. With its deterrent power diminished, Iran may see developing nuclear weapons as the only way to regain its former status. The strikes, therefore, are a preemptive measure to prevent Iran from crossing the nuclear threshold.</p>

Officials are evaluating how India Rare Earths, a government-owned company, can increase rare earth magnet production. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but significant public and private investment is needed. The move comes as China's dominance in rare earth production and processing has given it considerable leverage over the supply of minerals crucial for modern technologies.</p>
