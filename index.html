          <p>Shayna Glassman, whose late father was terrorized by his neighbor David Berkowitz, has been visiting the convicted "Son of Sam" serial killer in prison. Her father, Craig Glassman, was a key figure in Berkowitz's 1977 arrest, and Shayna feels the connection is her way of being with the father she lost at a young age. Despite her family's reservations, she has visited Berkowitz multiple times, describing their relationship as a deep psychological exploration rather than a romance. She believes that even in the darkest situations, there is a potential for light and understanding.</p>

          <p>Sports commentator Stephen A. Smith responded to former First Lady Michelle Obama after she compared ESPN shows to reality television. While disagreeing with her characterization of sports media, Smith focused his remarks on comments she made during the 2024 campaign, where she suggested a vote for Donald Trump was a vote against women. Smith stated he took "major offense" to this, arguing that voters consider many factors like the economy and national security. He clarified that while he did not vote for Trump, he felt Obama's comments were a form of emotional blackmail.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led two federal cases against President Donald Trump. The probe follows a request from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions constituted illegal campaign activity and violated the Hatch Act, which restricts political activities by government officials. The OSC, an independent agency that handles civil service rule violations, does not have criminal authority but can recommend disciplinary action. The cases against Trump were closed after his 2024 election win, per Justice Department policy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Despite his impressive performance, the Dodgers lost 4-0, with Snell giving up three runs on two home runs by Rays slugger Yandy Díaz. Both homers took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary home field. Although the result was a loss, Snell's return is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on their rotation depth for a strong late-season push.</p>

          <p>South African authorities have arrested almost 1,000 undocumented foreign nationals for working illegally at the Sheba Gold Mine in the northeastern Mpumalanga province. The arrests were part of "Operation Vala Umgodi," a week-long effort to combat illegal mining, a widespread issue in South Africa's approximately 6,000 abandoned mines. Many of these illegal miners, known as "zama-zamas," come from neighboring countries like Eswatini and Mozambique. The detained individuals will face charges for immigration violations and potentially illegal mining, with police noting that some of those arrested may be underage.</p>

Aid agencies state that most food convoys are looted by armed gangs and desperate crowds before reaching distribution points. Israel maintains its restrictions are necessary to pressure Hamas, but international groups have condemned the measures as a form of collective punishment.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has climbed to €3,248, a figure that is overwhelming for many retirees whose average pension is around €1,100 per month. This sharp increase is attributed to rising wages for nursing staff and an increase in staffing levels. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance system, as the gap between income and expenses has become unsustainable. With an aging population, the number of Germans needing care is expected to rise by 37% by 2055, placing further strain on the system.</p>

Co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted the platform's staggering growth, which now underpins trillions in payments and is being adopted by major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank for tokenized assets. As Ethereum becomes integrated into Wall Street's core infrastructure, Buterin warns of the risk of centralization if too few large entities control the ecosystem.

While the award is slightly above the current inflation rate and higher than the 2.8% initially proposed, the federation stated it does little to reverse over a decade of real-terms pay cuts.

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted President Trump's sweeping asylum ban, ruling that the administration cannot suspend laws protecting migrants from being deported to countries where they face torture or persecution. The D.C. Circuit Court panel's decision limits a proclamation Mr. Trump issued to close the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself, it affirmed that migrants must still be allowed to apply for other mandatory forms of humanitarian protection. The ruling represents a significant legal check on the administration's border policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration appeared to have unconstitutionally targeted people based on factors like their race or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed after high-profile raids in June triggered widespread protests and fear. This decision reinforces the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures for all individuals, regardless of immigration status, within the region.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton described his own driving as "terrible" and "useless" after qualifying in 12th place for the Hungarian Grand Prix. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprise pole position, Hamilton struggled for pace and failed to advance past the second qualifying session. This result continues a trend of qualifying difficulties for Hamilton in 2025, where he has been consistently outpaced by Leclerc. Despite his personal frustration, Hamilton congratulated his teammate and the team, acknowledging that the car itself was capable of being on pole.</p>

          <p>Health officials are warning the public to avoid the water near Camp Richardson resort on Lake Tahoe's southern shore after a sewage leak led to the detection of high levels of E. coli bacteria. The U.S. Forest Service issued the advisory after water quality tests confirmed the contamination. The resort located and began repairing the leak, but the public is advised to stay out of the water from Jameson Beach to the Valhalla Boathouse as a precaution. This incident follows a major sewage spill on the lake's northern shore last summer, which resulted in an $850,000 fine.</p>

The investigation found signatures from deceased individuals and people who said they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings highlight potential flaws in the petitioning process.

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, ending with a four-day losing streak for the S&P 500 after hitting a record high on Monday. The volatility was fueled by a confluence of major news, including a much weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new positions. This data, coupled with the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady and President Trump's announcement of new "reciprocal" tariff rates, created significant market uncertainty. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the biggest loser, dropping over 2% for the week amid the broader economic jitters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article highlights several behavioral signs that may indicate someone is struggling financially, despite appearances. Key indicators include not having a formal financial plan, prioritizing expensive brand-name items over more economical choices, and confusing a high income with actual wealth. The report notes that nearly half of Americans earning over $100,000 a year live paycheck to paycheck. Other warning signs include a lack of financial discipline, a tendency toward impulse buying funded by credit, and chasing get-rich-quick schemes instead of pursuing consistent, long-term wealth-building strategies.

Before her dismissal, England showcased their overwhelming power, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick and several other players touching down.

The legacy of racially segregated pools created generational gaps in swimming ability and water safety knowledge.
