          <p>Police in Somerset are assessing footage of on-stage comments made by musical acts Bob Vylan and Kneecap at the Glastonbury Festival. The review follows a performance where the rap punk duo Bob Vylan led chants calling for "death" to the Israeli military, which the UK government strongly condemned. The BBC, which broadcast the set live with a warning, deemed the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, reaching 101.7 miles per hour, and allowed only one hit and one walk. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss.

          <p>Civil servants across China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent local austerity measures that often exceed central government regulations. This shift in lifestyle is a result of what is known in Mandarin as "ceng ceng jia ma," or the practice of adding extra layers of control at each level of bureaucracy. An official in Sichuan province reported that his department head implemented a ban on eating out, reflecting a broader trend of caution among public employees to avoid any perception of extravagance or non-compliance with the intensified anti-corruption climate.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive domestic policy and spending bill has cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate, passing by a narrow 51-49 vote. The advancement came after intense last-minute negotiations secured the support of several Republican holdouts, avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill now proceeds to a final debate, where Democrats plan to delay proceedings by requesting a full reading of the 940-page document. Its ultimate passage remains uncertain due to narrow majorities and significant policy disputes within the Republican party. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's recent halt on rare earth exports is expected to accelerate international efforts to establish alternative production facilities, though the process will be costly and challenging. According to American firm REalloys, building a non-Chinese supply chain will require significant investment, subsidies, and tariffs to compete with China's market dominance. REalloys itself is planning a US$50 million project to produce high-performance magnet materials by 2027, sourcing ore from Brazil for processing in Canada, highlighting the complex, multi-national strategies required to reduce reliance on China.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains why cities often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly as heat. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water benefit from natural cooling through evaporation. This effect makes growing urban populations particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and more intense heatwaves.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez in Venice has sparked protests from local residents who decry the event as an exploitation of their city. Hundreds marched with banners like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," contrasting sharply with the celebrity-filled, multi-day celebration. Activists argue that such extravagant events highlight the struggles of ordinary Venetians facing overtourism, high living costs, and environmental threats. While Bezos made a donation to local environmental groups, many protesters dismissed it as an attempt to appease criticism.</p>

The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund, educates students on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout by 2026. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life.

The large turnout was partly a reaction to the government's attempt to ban the march, citing a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban by organizing the event under a different legal provision. The march became a broad celebration of human rights and solidarity, sending a clear message of opposition to Orban's policies.</p>
