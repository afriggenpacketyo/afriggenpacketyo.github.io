          <p>Tesla has refuted claims that its board contacted headhunters to find a successor for CEO Elon Musk, amidst concerns over his focus on government roles and Tesla's stock performance. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm stated the report was false, affirming the board's confidence in Musk's leadership. Musk criticized the Wall Street Journal for publishing the article, calling it a breach of ethics. The original report suggested the board wanted Musk to dedicate more time to Tesla, a suggestion he seemingly agreed to during an earnings call where he pledged to reduce his government involvement. This denial seeks to reassure investors amid recent stock value declines and internal tensions.</p>

          <p>China has enacted a new private sector law aimed at curbing "profit-driven" enforcement that unfairly targets non-state businesses. The law seeks to address long-standing complaints about cross-regional enforcement and reinforce accountability for officials.

The enactment of this law is viewed as a critical step to alleviate concerns among private entrepreneurs amid increasing economic pressures.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, influenced by concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and their impact on the economic outlook. While Japan's inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, allowing room for rate increases, the potential trade disruptions from tariffs have complicated monetary policy normalization. BOJ Governor Kazo Ueda cautioned that drastic changes to tariff policies would affect the central bank's monetary policy outlook. The central bank will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is seen as a charm offensive aimed at improving relations with the EU. The move comes amid global uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariffs and China's desire to find new export markets. While the EU welcomes the lifting of sanctions, it remains committed to addressing human rights concerns in China, particularly regarding the Uyghur minority. Experts believe this is unlikely to revive a frozen investment deal.</p>

          <p>The United States military lacks the personnel and resources needed to fight a major war, according to this article. The authors argue that the U.S. has prioritized high-tech weaponry over quantity, leaving it vulnerable in prolonged conflicts. They point to the war in Ukraine, Israeli battles, and operations against the Houthis as examples of the demands of modern warfare, highlighting shortages in artillery shells, missiles, and recruits. The authors urge Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to prioritize resources that strengthen combat power, such as active service members, ammunition, new ships, and new aircraft.</p>
