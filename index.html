          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. Through a $400 million investment in preferred stock, the Pentagon aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for critical minerals used in advanced military technology like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership is designed to reduce U.S. reliance on China for rare earths and accelerate the onshoring of magnet manufacturing capabilities. The company's CEO, James Litinsky, emphasized that this is not a nationalization but a strategic collaboration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A whistleblower has released text messages and emails to Congress that allegedly show Emil Bove, a Trump nominee for a federal judgeship, directing a Justice Department lawyer to defy a court order. The messages, shared by former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni, pertain to the mistaken deportation of a man to El Salvador and the subsequent efforts to secure his return. Reuveni claims he was fired for questioning the instructions, while the Justice Department has denied the allegations. The revelations have intensified scrutiny of Bove's nomination ahead of a key committee vote.</p>

          <p>A coalition of media organizations, including Fox News and The Associated Press, has formally requested an Idaho judge to lift the gag order in the Bryan Kohberger case. The motion argues that since Kohberger has pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho students, the original purpose of the order—to protect his right to a fair trial—is no longer relevant. The gag order has prevented lawyers, investigators, and witnesses from discussing case details not revealed in court, leaving many questions unanswered. The media outlets contend that with no trial pending, the restriction on First Amendment rights is no longer justifiable.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts has climbed 18 spots to rank as the 20th best state for business in CNBC's 2025 study, making it the most improved state of the year. This turnaround is largely attributed to its relative financial independence from Washington D.C., a key factor in this year's rankings due to potential federal budget cuts. The state's economy, with a smaller federal workforce and lower dependency on federal funds, showed significant improvement. However, Massachusetts still faces challenges, including being the second-most-expensive state for business and having a heavy regulatory environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis by Global Witness shows that the fossil fuel industry donated more than $19 million to Donald Trump's presidential inaugural fund, constituting nearly 8% of the record-breaking $239 million total. Major contributors included energy giants like Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips, raising concerns about the industry's influence on an administration that has actively promoted fossil fuel extraction. In contrast, President Joe Biden's inaugural committee banned donations from the oil and gas sector. The report suggests a significant return on investment for the industry through deregulation and other favorable policies.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a report warning that the threat from Iran is "rising" and "unpredictable," urging the government to adopt a more robust, long-term strategy. The report highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings, against opponents of the Iranian regime residing in the UK since early 2022. The Intelligence and Security Committee accuses the government of focusing too much on crisis management rather than countering Iran's wide-ranging hostile activities. The Iranian embassy has rejected the report's findings as "biased" and "baseless."</p>

The timing of the drill is significant, as it coincides with China's own military maneuvers across the Taiwan Strait.

          <p>Some regional affiliates of Planned Parenthood have started to inform patients they can no longer accept Medicaid, following the passage of a Republican bill signed by President Trump that defunds the organization for one year. This provision, which blocks federal funding for services like birth control and STI tests, has been temporarily frozen by a court order after Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit. The situation remains fluid, with some affiliates canceling and then rescheduling appointments for Medicaid patients. Abortion rights advocates have called the measure a "backdoor abortion ban" that could force the closure of hundreds of health centers.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated that the country's welfare system is too easy to claim and is being exploited, proposing stricter measures to limit access to benefits. Her proposals include barring most foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits and preventing individuals with less severe mental health conditions, like mild depression, from being signed off work. Badenoch argued for a "crackdown on people exploiting the system" and a return to face-to-face assessments. The Labour Party criticized the proposals, stating the Conservatives failed to reform the system during their 14 years in government.</p>

The tax hike is intended to improve public health and generate revenue as the nation prepares for demographic shifts that will increase healthcare costs. While supported by the World Health Organization, the move faces opposition from the alcohol industry, which is already grappling with declining sales.</p>

Drivers are also motivated by lower running costs, with charging being significantly cheaper than fuel and maintenance expenses being reduced.

Conceived by sound engineer Owsley "Bear" Stanley, the massive rig was designed to provide a perfectly clear and consistent audio experience for the entire audience by placing the entire PA system behind the band. While utopian in theory, the system was a logistical nightmare, weighing as much as a dozen elephants and being prone to technical failures. The immense cost and complexity of the wall contributed to the band's temporary hiatus in 1974.</p>

If a storm does form, it is expected to be a tropical depression or a weak tropical storm rather than a hurricane, similar to the development of Tropical Storm Chantal earlier in the season.</p>
