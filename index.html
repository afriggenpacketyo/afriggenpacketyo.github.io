          <p>Israeli officials suggest their military actions against Iran could lead to regime change, which would significantly impact global oil prices. While oil prices have risen about 10% since the attacks began, they remain below $80 per barrel due to undisturbed supplies. Analysts warn that prolonged conflict increases the risk of supply disruptions and price spikes. JPMorgan notes that past regime changes in oil-producing countries have resulted in substantial price increases, but there are no immediate indications of the regime's collapse in Iran, but further destabilization could lead to higher oil prices.

          <p>Computer science enrollment is declining in universities across the United States, signaling a potential bursting of the computer science bubble. The decline is attributed to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which is increasingly capable of writing code.

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt's new book explores his unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a truck driver and Joe Rogan fan. Litt sought Kappler's help in learning to surf, leading to a shared experience that bridged their ideological differences. Surfing became a metaphor for confronting fear and an antidote to overthinking, while their friendship offered a way to connect beyond political divides. Litt argues for shared activities that allow understanding between individuals with differing views, emphasizing the importance of finding neutral ground.</p>

Crossing the event horizon of a black hole, they discover new forms of association and freedom from their past shame.</p>
