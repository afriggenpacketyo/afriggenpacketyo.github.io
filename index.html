          <p>China is accelerating its efforts to construct the world's first nuclear fusion reactor capable of achieving net energy generation, named the Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best), located in Hefei, and is expected to be completed in 2027. The project involves assembling tens of thousands of components and is being led by Neo Fusion, a state-backed company. According to project engineer Song Yuntao, China has mastered the core technologies, and chairman Yan Jianwen noted the project's rapid progress, referring to it as 'China speed.' This initiative aims to commercialize a clean, safe, and near-limitless energy source.</p>

          <p>The area in South Texas where Elon Musk's SpaceX operates has officially been incorporated as the city of Starbase, with residents, mostly SpaceX employees, voting overwhelmingly in favor. The new city will be governed by a mayor and two commissioners, holding power over planning and taxation, with SpaceX vice-president Bobby Peden set to be the first mayor. While some nearby residents have voiced opposition due to environmental concerns, Starbase's incorporation could lead to disputes with Cameron County over beach access during rocket launches. This development follows Musk's relocation of many of his business operations to Texas, citing favorable regulations.</p>

          <p>Clinicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs are expressing concerns that the president's return-to-office mandate is forcing them to conduct sensitive conversations in inadequate spaces, which compromises patient privacy. This situation arises as clinicians are being asked to work from makeshift areas where confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, potentially affecting the quality and security of mental health services provided to veterans. The shift back to in-person work, while intended to improve efficiency, is creating challenges in maintaining the necessary privacy standards for therapeutic settings, leading to ethical and practical dilemmas for VA staff.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation into the Hennepin County Attorneyâ€™s Office following a directive from the county attorney to consider race when negotiating plea deals. The investigation will focus on whether the HCAO is illegally considering race in prosecutorial decision-making, with a comprehensive review of relevant policies and practices. The directive instructs prosecutors to consider racial identity as part of the overall analysis and to address racial disparities at decision points, as appropriate, which has raised concerns about potential violations of constitutional rights.

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a one-person adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray,' which explores themes of narcissism and image obsession in the age of social media. The production uses elaborate camerawork and smartphone technology to portray Dorian's descent into hedonism and his fascination with the gap between his false perfection and true self. The play contrasts with another London import, 'Vanya,' offering different perspectives on self-expression and the performance of identity in a culture dominated by social media. The article examines how the play scrutinizes the superficiality embraced by Dorian and his peers and how it ultimately destroys the tender parts of a person.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen U.S. government health-tracking programs appear to have been eliminated due to layoffs and proposed budget cuts, impacting data collection on deaths, diseases, and various health issues. Programs tracking pregnancies, lead poisoning, sexual violence, and youth smoking have been affected at the CDC. Health Secretary Robert F.

Critics argue that these cuts will harm vulnerable populations and undermine efforts to address health disparities, especially in HIV prevention and mental health.

          <p>Reform UK is exploring legal avenues to challenge the government's housing of migrants in areas where the party now controls local councils, including potential judicial reviews and injunctions. The party aims to resist the housing of asylum seekers in Reform-controlled areas, citing concerns about regulations and budget allocation. While acknowledging the limited power at the local level, Reform UK plans to utilize all available instruments to fulfill its pledge and address what it views as inappropriate use of hotels as hostels.</p>

The attack, claimed by the Houthis in solidarity with Hamas, prompted a strong response from Israeli officials, who vowed retaliation. This incident is a rare success for the Houthis in penetrating Israel's defenses and adds to regional tensions amid ongoing conflicts.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's second term is characterized by loyalty and disinhibition, contrasting it with his first term's coalition government. The selection of JD Vance as vice president is highlighted as a key moment, signaling a shift towards surrounding himself with courtiers rather than advisors. The author suggests that this change in structure, marked by a lack of skepticism and a focus on loyalty, will lead to a more reckless and unconstrained presidency, with the traditional guardrails of government effectively removed.</p>
