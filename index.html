          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that pro-Palestine groups on college campuses, particularly those supporting Hamas, should be banned, drawing a parallel to the historical banning of hate groups like the KKK. The author contends that these groups often advocate for violence and the destruction of Israel, masking their intentions behind claims of fighting for fairness. The article asserts that such groups promote a progressive ideology that apologizes for violence, posing a threat to college students. The author concludes that universities should not tolerate these groups and should judge them based on their actions, not on a sliding moral scale. (maximum two Fox News articles)</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic discusses the relationship between economic growth (g) and interest rates (r) in the context of the national debt. It argues that the combination of Trump's trade policies and tax cuts is pushing the U.S. into dangerous territory, where r is higher than g. This could lead to a debt crisis as rising interest rates force the government to borrow more, shaking investor confidence. The article warns of potential stagflation and the need for Washington to address the debt.</p>
