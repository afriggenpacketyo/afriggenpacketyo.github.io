          <p>The article reports that President Trump is pressuring Harvard University by threatening to block its enrollment of foreign students, citing concerns about left-wing ideologies and pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The administration has already frozen billions in funding and issued a deadline for Harvard to provide information on foreign students. Harvard has sued the administration, arguing the order would cause irreparable injury. The government is demanding sweeping reforms to counter perceived left-wing dominance and eliminate DEI programs, raising questions about academic freedom and government overreach. The situation remains uncertain as legal battles continue over funding and enrollment policies.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the looming famine in Gaza due to restricted humanitarian aid. While Israel is allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza, aid agencies claim it is insufficient to meet the needs of the population. The United Nations reports delays in distributing supplies due to security clearance issues and logistical problems caused by the war. Despite the availability of tons of food assistance, convoys are obstructed by bombings, looting, and damaged roads, leading to a surge in bread prices.

          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, praising graduates as the first of America's "golden age" and emphasizing his administration's commitment to national security and border protection. He touted accomplishments like the "Golden Dome" missile defense system and criticized past administrations for involving the military in nation-building efforts. Trump also highlighted his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, stating there would be no more critical race theory or transgender policies imposed on the military.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico, despite his fears of harm there. The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to Guatemala, his home country, under a U.S. immigration judge's order. The judge found the deportation likely "lacked any semblance of due process," as the man had previously been sexually assaulted and held for ransom in Mexico. This ruling adds to a series of court findings against recent Trump administration deportations, highlighting concerns over due process and the treatment of asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>During his commencement speech at West Point, President Trump reiterated his stance against biological males competing in girls' and women's sports, referencing an executive order he signed. He stated that girls and women "will not" compete against transgender athletes, asserting the policy is meant to protect women's sports from being "demeaning." While several states have defied this order, leading to federal Title IX investigations, the issue remains a contentious topic, with public opinion divided. Recent surveys indicate a majority of Americans, including a significant portion of Democrats, oppose transgender athletes competing in women's sports.</p>

The win continues Neon's unprecedented streak of backing the last six Palme d'Or winners.

          <p>DMVs across the country are warning drivers about a new wave of phishing text messages designed to steal personal and financial information. The scam texts warn recipients of unpaid fees on traffic violations and threaten penalties if they do not comply. These messages are not from official sources and are part of an increasing trend of scammers using fear tactics under the guise of an official domain. Experts advise registering phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, avoiding clicking links from unknown numbers, and remaining skeptical when personal information is requested.</p>

          <p>A power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, with French authorities investigating possible arson. The outage, affecting 160,000 households, occurred after a fire at an electrical substation and the collapse of a high-voltage line. Despite the disruption, the Palme d'Or ceremony proceeded as planned due to the Palais des Festivals switching to an independent power supply. Traffic lights were affected, causing congestion, and some shops remained closed. The incident led to investigations into potential arson and acts of vandalism against electrical infrastructures.</p>

Trump also discussed his crackdown on immigration, praised golfer Gary Player, and shared anecdotes about real estate developer William Levitt.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1 as it approached for landing, leading two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact caused confusion among air traffic controllers, who were unsure of the helicopter's precise location. An Army official attributed the issue to a temporary antenna and stated there was no risk of intersecting air traffic.

          <p>The exploitation of rare-earth minerals in Myanmar's Kachin State is causing significant environmental harm and raising concerns about financing conflict, according to activists. In-situ leaching techniques, involving the injection of chemicals into the ground, are posing risks to both the environment and local villagers. The mining operations, largely conducted by Chinese companies, have led to deforestation, water contamination, and health issues for workers. The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) has gained control of the mineral-rich region, leading to negotiations with Chinese producers on taxing rare earth extraction, but the unregulated mining continues to pose urgent threats.</p>

          <p>German police have stated that the knife attack at Hamburg Central Station is not considered politically motivated and believe the attacker has a mental illness. A magistrate ordered the 39-year-old German woman to be placed in a psychiatric clinic on Saturday. The detention order is for attempted murder in conjunction with 15 counts of grievous bodily harm. The police added that there are currently no indications that the suspect was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Eighteen people were injured in the attack, and all are in stable condition.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine engaged in large-scale dueling air assaults overnight Saturday, launching hundreds of drones in hourslong raids. The attacks came as both sides were carrying out the war’s largest prisoner exchange. Russia’s attack on Ukraine was particularly significant, involving 250 long-range drones and 14 ballistic missiles, with Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, the main target. But Saturday’s attacks underscored that for all the efforts toward de-escalation, the fighting remains as fierce as ever.</p>
