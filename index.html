          <p>American electricity companies are struggling to forecast the actual power that will be needed to support the boom in artificial intelligence data centers. While tech companies are announcing ambitious projects that could consume as much electricity as entire cities, they are often pitching the same projects to multiple utilities, creating uncertainty about which demand projections are real. This ambiguity complicates long-term grid planning and could lead to billions in unnecessary infrastructure investments, while also contributing to rising electricity prices for consumers. Experts agree a significant increase in consumption is coming but debate its ultimate scale and the risk of overbuilding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss running shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit over its popular CloudTec shoe design. Plaintiffs allege that the shoes develop a loud and embarrassing squeaking sound with each step, a defect they claim the company has dismissed as normal wear and tear. The lawsuit, filed in Oregon, contends that customers would not have paid a premium price for the footwear had they known about the noise issue. The complaint seeks damages for what it claims are thousands of affected consumers who were unable to get refunds under the company's warranty policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its key interest rate at its upcoming October meeting, historical trends suggest that mortgage rates could fall even before the official announcement. Lenders often "price in" anticipated Fed cuts, leading to rate drops in the days or weeks prior to the central bank's decision. This pattern was observed before previous rate cuts in September 2024 and 2025, creating brief windows of opportunity for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The article advises potential borrowers to prepare by improving their credit scores and monitoring rates closely to capitalize on any potential dip. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stephen Bryant, a 44-year-old South Carolina inmate, is scheduled to be executed next month for a murder he committed over 20 years ago. After killing Willard Tietjen, Bryant burned the victim's eyes and used his blood to write "catch me if u can" on a wall. Prosecutors stated that this was one of three murders Bryant committed in Sumter County during a few weeks in October 2004, creating widespread fear in the community. Bryant's lawyers unsuccessfully argued for a delay, citing his history of childhood sexual assault and drug use as mitigating factors. He will be the seventh inmate executed in the state in 14 months.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump at the White House to press his case for acquiring U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to aid in the war against Russia. While Zelenskyy expressed confidence that the war could be ended with Trump's help, the U.S. president showed caution about the request. Trump expressed concern about depleting the American weapons supply and acknowledged that providing such long-range missiles would be an "escalation." The meeting occurred one day after Trump held a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the contents of which he said he would share with Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>A potential meeting in Budapest between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump faces significant logistical challenges due to a European Union ban on Russian aircraft. As Hungary is a landlocked EU and NATO member, Putin's presidential plane would require special permission, or a derogation, from neighboring countries to fly through their airspace. This situation highlights the diplomatic complexities of the proposed summit, as any flight path would likely need consent from nations like Bulgaria or Romania. While Hungarian officials have expressed confidence in arranging the visit, the practicalities of Putin's travel remain a major unresolved issue.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, accusing them of illegally marketing their products as recyclable when they are not processed by the state's facilities. The lawsuit claims that the thicker plastic bags sold in stores since the 2014 ban on single-use bags overwhelmingly end up in landfills rather than being recycled. The state's investigation found that these bags are not accepted at the vast majority of California's recycling centers. Alongside the lawsuit, the state announced a settlement with four other producers who agreed to halt sales and pay over $1.7 million in penalties.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in gold prices to record highs is prompting some market strategists to reconsider the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond investment portfolio. Amid inflation and geopolitical risks, some are advocating for a 60/20/20 model, which reduces the bond allocation and adds a 20% share for alternatives like gold and cryptocurrency. This shift reflects a growing view that bonds no longer provide the same level of protection, and that gold is moving from a "fringe" asset to a core holding. The trend is supported by massive inflows into gold ETFs this year, driven by central bank demand and de-dollarization trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has not seen the formation of bipartisan negotiating groups, or "gangs," that have helped resolve past stalemates. Democratic lawmakers attribute this to a profound lack of trust in President Donald Trump, fearing he would renege on any agreement reached with Republican legislators, as he has in the past. This dynamic has stalled talks, with Democrats insisting on an "ironclad path forward" before reopening the government. The impasse continues into its third week, with both sides appearing entrenched and polls suggesting more Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown.</p>

          <p>In his visit to Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing the Trump administration for more than just Tomahawk missiles. He is also requesting upgraded air defense systems and, crucially, increased U.S. intelligence sharing to help Ukrainian forces conduct more effective strikes against Russia's energy infrastructure. This strategy aims to cripple the main source of funding for Moscow's war effort. The request for targeting assistance for Ukraine's own domestically produced drones represents a potential way for the U.S. to increase pressure on Russia without directly providing the long-range weapons that President Trump has expressed hesitation about supplying.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive Russian air incursions into NATO airspace appear to have backfired, prompting a newly unified and assertive response from the alliance. European leaders, such as Estonia's Prime Minister, note that NATO's quick interception of Russian jets and the establishment of a new eastern flank defense plan, "Eastern Sentry," sent a strong message of resolve. This alignment between European leaders and a seemingly more supportive President Trump may be pressuring Vladimir Putin to engage in diplomacy, as evidenced by his recent call with Trump. The article suggests this rare unity could be a key factor in altering the course of the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A mother whose stillborn son was discovered at a Hull funeral home nearly two years after his supposed cremation says she is trying to forgive the undertaker responsible. Jasmine Beverley held a funeral for her son, Sunny, in 2022 and was given an urn of ashes, which police later revealed were not his. Former undertaker Robert Bush has pleaded guilty to fraud in her case, admitting he deceived her and three other women. The discovery, which came while Mrs. Beverley was pregnant with another child, caused her severe emotional distress, but the family has since held a second funeral to properly lay Sunny to rest.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is set to pay an additional $828 million to settle approximately 400 more cases of alleged sexual assault in county facilities. This new award follows a historic $4-billion settlement approved in April for a separate group of victims.

          <p>This opinion article argues there is a stark contrast between President Trump's portrayal of himself as a global peacemaker and his actions within the United States. While he takes credit for a ceasefire in Gaza and pursues talks to end the war in Ukraine, he is simultaneously deploying U.S. troops to Democrat-run cities in what critics see as an act of political intimidation. The author suggests these domestic deployments are not about crime but are intended to provoke opposition and normalize a military presence ahead of elections. This "war at home" undermines his peacemaking claims and is seen by some analysts as dangerously fomenting civil conflict.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Los Angeles County have reported the first U.S. cases of a more severe form of mpox, known as clade I, in individuals with no recent travel history. This suggests local transmission of the strain, which has a higher fatality rate and is more likely to cause severe illness compared to the clade II virus responsible for the 2022 global outbreak. While the risk to the general public remains low, officials are concerned and are urging at-risk groups to get vaccinated with the two-dose JYNNEOS vaccine.
