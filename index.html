          <p>Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in an interview on CBS News Sunday Morning, discussed President Trump's escalating pressure on higher education, particularly universities like Harvard. Summers characterized Trump's tactics as "extortion," citing the potential loss of billions in research funds, threats to foreign students, and challenges to academic freedom.

          <p>A psychologist identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as particularly damaging to relationships. This comparison undermines a partner's sense of worth and fosters insecurity. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper communication issues, specifically the fear of openly expressing needs. The psychologist advises couples to communicate their needs clearly and directly to foster a healthier relationship, rather than relying on comparisons that erode trust and intimacy.</p>

          <p>Households in South East England are being urged to ration water use due to severe drought conditions, which have left the region drier than locations like Sydney and Dallas. Southern Water's managing director, Tim Mcmahon, said that customers must reduce usage to prevent future bill increases and infrastructure investments. The company plans to change its water sources and invest in new infrastructure, including reservoirs, to address the issue. The driest parts of the South East receive less rainfall than Sydney and Istanbul.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war and tariffs on Chinese goods are posing a significant threat to the Panama Canal, a critical passage for U.S. East Coast-bound container traffic. The trade war uncertainty has led to a massive pause on U.S. imports from China, resulting in increased blank sailings and impacting Panama Canal revenue. The canal, which handles 40% of U.S. container traffic, faces a potential business slump due to the decline in manufactured goods being ordered by U.S. shippers.</p>
