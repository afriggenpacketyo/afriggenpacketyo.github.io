          <h2>Trump's Approval Rating Hits New Low Amid Economic Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll indicates that Donald Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 39%, the lowest of any president in the past 80 years at this point in their term. The poll highlights widespread disapproval of Trump's policies, particularly concerning the economy, with 72% of respondents expressing concern about a potential recession. Negative assessments extend beyond the economy, with majorities expressing concern about the administration's respect for the rule of law and efforts to expand presidential powers. The poll also reveals that while Trump retains strong support among Republicans, his approval ratings have declined among key demographic groups, including non-college-educated white men.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As stock and bond markets experience increased volatility, dividend stocks are attracting a wider range of investors seeking income and stability. While over 100 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focus on dividend stocks, actively managed dividend ETFs, such as the T. Rowe Dividend Growth ETF (TDVG), are gaining traction. These funds aim to identify high-quality dividend payers that offer both capital appreciation and yield, though investors should still be aware of the tech sector's presence in these funds. Investors should exercise caution when selecting dividend funds based solely on yield, as high-yield payers may be more vulnerable to dividend cuts if their financial positions weaken.

          <p>The Chinese coastguard has reportedly seized a tiny sandbank, Sandy Cay, in the South China Sea, escalating the regional dispute with the Philippines. State media released images of Chinese officers on the disputed reef, prompting condemnation from the White House, which warned that such actions threaten regional stability and violate international law. The Philippines responded by landing on three sandbanks, mimicking the Chinese photo. The incident occurs as US and Philippine forces conduct joint military exercises, criticized by China as provocative, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the contested region, where multiple countries have overlapping territorial claims.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities conducted a raid at an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs, resulting in the arrest of 114 illegal immigrants. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) led the operation, uncovering drugs, evidence of prostitution, and multiple firearms. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that the nightclub was "frequented by TdA and MS-13 terrorists." Lax immigration policies in Colorado have reportedly allowed TdA to use the state as a command center for human and drug trafficking. Approximately a dozen U.S. active-duty service members were found at the club, with the Army CID investigating their involvement.</p>

The incident involved an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a regional passenger jet. The crew had requested and received permission to use visual separation shortly before the crash.

Critics argue that the mothers were not given a genuine choice and that the deportations violate due process rights. The children, ages 2, 4, and 7, were deported to Honduras along with their mothers.</p>

This has fueled speculation that Trump may not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace deal.

MAGA Republicans express a more positive outlook on the U.S. economy under Trump, while other voters have become less approving of his handling of economic issues.

          <p>Former Biden White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism regarding the Trump administration's approach to the war in Ukraine following a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Sullivan noted that Trump's recent criticism of Putin suggests he may be realizing that Putin is not genuinely interested in a ceasefire. However, Sullivan cautioned against Trump reverting to putting pressure on Ukraine and making concessions to Russia. He criticized the administration's earlier actions, such as giving Putin U.S. recognition of Crimea.</p>

          <p>A senior figure from South Africa's ruling ANC party has defended his country's sovereignty amid growing tensions with the US over race relations and a new land law. ANC National Chair Gwede Mantashe criticized South African citizens who have called on Trump to "punish" the country. Tensions have also played out publicly on Elon Musk's X page, where he has described his country's ownership laws as "racist". Currently white South Africans, who are a minority of the population, own most of the country's private land and wealth, despite the racist system of apartheid ending decades ago.</p>

He described Trump's strategy as "strategic uncertainty," creating leverage in negotiations. He also acknowledged that investors may be concerned about the U.S. economy, but said that the long-term fundamentals are strong.</p>

          <p>Republicans in North Carolina are attempting to overturn an election that did not go their way, focusing on technicalities and reinterpreting voting laws after Election Day. This effort, though narrowed, has gained legal traction and may sketch a blueprint for overturning future elections. Legal experts from both parties note that a losing candidate has never gained so much legal ground in trying to nullify votes cast by people who followed all instructions. The willingness of judges to entertain these challenges raises concerns about the integrity of future elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are facing a wave of lawsuits from state officials, small businesses, and political groups, who argue that the president is overstepping his authority by imposing taxes on imports without Congressional approval. The lawsuits contend that Trump is sidestepping Congress and taxing virtually any import at levels to his liking. One plaintiff, Rick Woldenberg, the chief executive of Learning Resources, is challenging the tariffs due to the significant financial burden they place on his educational toy company.</p>
