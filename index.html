The mission, which is federally funded, follows the Trump administration's recent federalization of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. Since the operation began, authorities have made nearly 200 arrests, targeting offenses such as homicide, drug trafficking, and illegal firearm possession, as part of the effort to address crime in the nation's capital.</p>

Her death highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and potential famine, with over 250 hunger-related deaths reported by the Hamas-run health ministry. This occurs as Israel denies that starvation is present in the region and continues its military operations while planning to relocate Gaza City residents.</p>

While meteorological models suggest Erin will remain well off the U.S. East Coast, it is still expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20 to August 27, posing a significant coastal hazard.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung's U.S. smartphone market share increased from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, signaling a renewed competition between the tech giants. This shift is partly attributed to Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which are gaining significant traction and offering a wider price range than Apple's current iPhone lineup. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to compete in this evolving market segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the success of the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act in preventing extinctions but warns of new threats from proposed legislation and the Trump administration. The piece refutes claims that the act should be weakened, citing the precarious state of species like the North Atlantic right whale and the recent crash in gray whale populations due to climate change. It argues that protecting marine mammals is crucial for ocean health and, ultimately, is a vital part of ensuring human survival.</p>

The government cited economic risks for its swift intervention, which occurred less than 12 hours after the strike began over stalled contract negotiations. The union, representing 10,000 flight attendants, criticized the move as a violation of their right to strike and accused the government of rewarding the airline's refusal to negotiate fairly.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his bravery during a 1944 mission where, despite suffering 72 separate injuries, he successfully piloted his flying boat to destroy a German U-boat. He was praised for his "determination, fortitude and devotion to duty," and his death marks the passing of the last of the 181 WWII Victoria Cross recipients.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the southern Syrian city of Sweida to demand self-determination for the country's Druze minority. The protest follows deadly clashes in July between Druze militias and Bedouin Sunni tribes, in which Druze groups accuse the Syrian government of siding with the Bedouins and committing atrocities. The protest is notable for being the first time the slogan of self-determination has been prominently used by the community, signaling a significant shift in its political demands.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump reportedly sent a personal letter to Vladimir Putin, which was hand-delivered by President Trump at the Alaska summit, concerning the plight of children abducted during the Russia-Ukraine war. The letter addresses the thousands of Ukrainian children who have been forcibly transferred to Russia, an act for which Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court as a war crime. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later expressed his gratitude for the First Lady's efforts to highlight the critical issue.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week higher, setting several new record highs driven by speculation over the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. A cooler-than-expected July consumer price index report on Tuesday fueled investor optimism for a potential rate cut in September, pushing markets upward. Despite a subsequent report showing higher wholesale inflation, market odds for a rate cut remained strong, continuing the positive momentum for much of the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to apply greater scrutiny when evaluating the "good moral character" requirement for those seeking American citizenship. The new policy mandates a "holistic assessment" that goes beyond a simple criminal record check, considering factors like community involvement, adherence to societal norms, and even lawful but "inconsistent" behavior like traffic infractions. Critics argue the move is designed to create more grounds for denial and to discourage legal immigrants from applying for citizenship.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix-based startup, Steel + Spark, is addressing the local homelessness crisis by converting old shipping containers into temporary housing units called "X-WING" shelters. Designed by architect Brian Stark, each unit is constructed from four containers arranged in an "X" shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The project offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution, with Stark now planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors using the same innovative method.</p>
