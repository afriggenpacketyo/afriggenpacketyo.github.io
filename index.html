        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article delves into the enduring and peculiar appeal of the classic children's book character, Amelia Bedelia, a maid known for her catastrophic literal interpretations of instructions. It explores various modern interpretations of her behavior, from seeing her as a representation of neurodivergence to viewing her as a subversive figure of class rebellion. The analysis highlights how her bizarre actions, which frustrate her employers but delight children, make her a fascinating character to revisit with an adult perspective.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun suspending flights after its flight attendants' union issued a 72-hour strike notice, signaling a potential work stoppage. The union states that contract negotiations have stalled over key issues like wages and unpaid work, while the airline claims the union's demands are exorbitant. This disruption could affect approximately 130,000 daily customers during the peak summer travel season, prompting the airline to offer full refunds for canceled flights.</p>

This move follows the deployment of National Guard troops to the capital as part of a stated effort to crack down on violent crime, despite police statistics showing a recent decrease. The plan is a significant assertion of federal power over local law enforcement and has been characterized by critics as a dictatorial overreach.</p>

Experts point to a significant generational shift, as aging baby boomer collectors sell off their 1950s and 1960s vehicles while younger millennial and Gen Z buyers show preference for newer, more practical supercars from the 1980s and later. This has led to an oversupply and falling prices for some of the most traditionally sought-after vintage cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing war in Sudan has triggered one of the country's worst cholera outbreaks in years, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The conflict has led to nearly 100,000 suspected cases and over 2,470 deaths, as mass displacement and a collapse in sanitation have created a dire humanitarian crisis. In regions like Darfur, communities lack clean water and are forced to drink from contaminated sources, overwhelming the few remaining medical facilities.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has announced a plan to build over 3,000 new settlement homes in the highly controversial E1 area of the occupied West Bank. Smotrich explicitly stated that the project's goal is to 'bury the idea of a Palestinian state' by breaking up the territorial contiguity of Palestinian land. This move has been condemned by the Palestinian foreign ministry and comes amid growing international calls to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>This analytical article from The Economist argues that the true alignment between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is not a covert conspiracy but an open and shared approach to power. It posits that both leaders operate by punishing their perceived enemies, undermining democratic institutions, and prioritizing personal authority over established norms. This public synergy of methods and goals, the article contends, poses a direct threat to the principles of liberal democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the recent trend of Western nations announcing their intent to recognize a Palestinian state, questioning what this diplomatic shift actually achieves. While recognition grants Palestine access to international bodies like the ICC, the analysis argues that these moves are often more symbolic than substantive. Many come with conditions for a demilitarized and non-contiguous state, suggesting the gestures are political maneuvers rather than a genuine push for a fully sovereign and equal nation.</p>

These thinkers are actively shaping the ideology of the modern GOP, pushing it toward a more aggressive and authoritarian stance.</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have reported sightings of rabbits with grotesque, horn-like growths on their faces, sparking local concern. However, scientists have clarified that the animals are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common virus spread by ticks and fleas. The virus, which is not transmissible to humans or other species, causes wart-like tumors that are typically harmless and disappear as the rabbit's immune system fights off the infection.</p>
