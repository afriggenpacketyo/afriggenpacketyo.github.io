            <p>Ecuador's center-right President Daniel Noboa has won re-election, securing a full four-year term after initially winning a snap election in November 2023; Noboa gained about 56% of the vote, defeating left-wing challenger Luisa González, who alleged fraud without providing evidence. His presidency has been marked by a military crackdown on violent criminal gangs, making Ecuador the most violent country in the region; Noboa aims to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases and wants foreign armies to help combat gangs. He also plans to invest in renewable energy, boost relations with the US, and address corruption and unemployment. </p>

            <p>China's exports unexpectedly rose by 12.4% in March, driven by businesses accelerating shipments to avoid impending U.S. tariffs, while imports declined by 4.3% due to weak domestic demand; these figures arrive amid heightened trade tensions, with the U.S. imposing tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods and China retaliating with levies of up to 125% on select American products. A Chinese customs official criticized the U.S.'s "abusive use of tariffs" and reiterated Beijing's desire for negotiations with Washington; China aims to open its economy for mutually beneficial trade and investment cooperation globally.

            <p>South Africa is set to reopen an inquest into the 1967 death of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Luthuli, the former leader of the banned African National Congress (ANC); the original inquest ruled Luthuli's death, caused by being struck by a train, as accidental, but activists and his family have long suspected foul play by the apartheid authorities. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) plans to present evidence to overturn the initial findings; the Luthuli case is one of two high-profile inquests into the deaths of anti-apartheid figures reopening, with the other concerning lawyer Mlungisi Griffiths Mxenge.</p>

            <p>Despite recently announced exemptions on smartphones and electronics from import tariffs on China, top U.S. officials, including Donald Trump, have indicated that these exemptions will be short-lived and future tariffs are planned; Trump promised to launch a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector and the "whole electronics supply chain". China's commerce ministry called the exemptions "a small step toward correcting its erroneous unilateral practice of 'reciprocal tariffs,'" and called for Washington to cancel the entire tariff regime; Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, stated that critical technology products from China would face separate new duties along with semiconductors within the next two months.</p>

            <p>Investors are seeking strategies to manage volatility in the treasury bond market amid concerns about potential shifts away from U.S. treasuries; the bond ladder strategy, involving investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity for regular income, is suggested as a way to mitigate short-term price swings. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers a bond ladder approach with a fixed monthly income through 2035; ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs are also a popular option for investors seeking a safe haven.
