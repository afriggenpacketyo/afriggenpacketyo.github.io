          <h2>Multiple States Sue Trump Administration Over Controversial Tariff Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dozen states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade, challenging the legality of its tariff policy.  The states argue that the tariffs are unlawful, imposed arbitrarily, and have severely disrupted the American economy.  The lawsuit contends that only Congress possesses the authority to levy tariffs, and the president's actions violate the constitutional order.  Arizona's Attorney General called the tariff scheme "insane" and "economically reckless and illegal."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is urging food companies to phase out six petroleum-based artificial food dyes by the end of next year.  The FDA aims to replace these dyes with natural alternatives, accelerating the review process for new natural color additives. While the FDA stopped short of an outright ban, the move is considered significant due to safety concerns raised about artificial dyes. The food dye industry, however, maintains that these dyes are essential for food product consistency and appeal.</p>

          <p>A Dartmouth College study estimates that extreme heat caused by emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies resulted in approximately $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020.

Five companies—Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP—account for roughly one-third of the total cost.
