          <p>Kris Jenner, the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch, has recently garnered attention for her seemingly rejuvenated appearance, sparking speculation about potential cosmetic procedures, specifically a deep plane facelift. While Jenner's representative confirmed Dr. Steven Levine performed the work, details on the exact procedure remain undisclosed. Experts suggest the results appear both youthful and natural, indicative of a well-executed procedure, potentially involving a fat transfer in addition to a facelift. It is important to discuss medical history, lifestyle, and aesthetic goals with the surgeon before undergoing a facelift, as well as any weight-loss medications being taken. The recovery period for a deep plane facelift can extend up to six months, with risks including infection and nerve damage.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has increased its military maneuvers around Taiwan in recent years, evolving from occasional sorties to coordinated campaigns. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises. Near-daily patrols have sharply increased since 2024, particularly after William Lai Ching-te assumed office as Taiwanese leader. These actions serve as both combat training and strategic signaling, with each category varying in scale, intensity, and purpose. PLATracker data indicates a significant rise in PLA aircraft entering Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ) compared to previous years.</p>

          <p>Reporters at Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks are expressing concerns about their future, especially foreign citizens who fear retribution from their home countries. The Trump administration issued mass layoff notices, eliminating 85% of positions at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA. Simultaneously, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty correspondent was sentenced to nine years in prison in Azerbaijan on charges deemed bogus by his superiors. VOA journalists, particularly those from countries with repressive media environments, are scrambling to find refuge or asylum as their visas expire, fearing imprisonment or worse if they return home. These actions cast doubt on the U.S. government's commitment to non-American journalists working for these networks, some of whom have risked their lives to report on sensitive issues.</p>

          <p>Prince William celebrated his 43rd birthday with a photo released by Kensington Palace showing him with the family's Cocker spaniel, Orla, and her three puppies. The photo, taken by the Princess of Wales in Windsor, was accompanied by a message signed by Catherine and their children, expressing their love. The Royal Family's official account also posted a birthday message with a picture of William visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall. Orla was gifted to the couple by Catherine's brother after the death of their previous dog, and the puppies were born in May.

          <p>China's property sector, already facing a downturn, is further challenged by a shrinking population, as Goldman Sachs estimates new home demand will remain suppressed. The country's population is projected to decline to below 1.39 billion by 2035, impacting home demand significantly. Falling population will reduce home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million in the 2030s, a stark contrast to the positive contribution of 1.5 million units in the 2010s. Despite Beijing's pronatalist policies, a combination of stagnant incomes, job instability, and a poor social security system continues to deter young people from having more children.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, especially regarding rare earth minerals, making it better prepared than most for China's export restrictions. Following China's 2010 embargo targeting Tokyo, Japan diversified its rare earth sources, investing heavily in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. As a result, Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths has decreased from over 90% to below 60%. While Japan has made strides, it still has a long way to go to cut its dependency on China in some key areas, especially for heavy rare earth elements. (not investment advice)</p>

This deployment follows recent Israeli strikes on Iran and heightened concerns after President Trump suggested military options to pressure Tehran.

Alaina Beresford, from Portknockie, sent the message as part of a school project, writing a letter explaining her project on water and asking the finder to write back. The bottle washed up on a Norwegian island and was discovered by Pia Brodtmann, a volunteer cleaning up the beach, who sent Alaina a postcard with details of the find. Alaina, now 42, was surprised and delighted to receive the response after so many years.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the current trend of online feminist criticism towards female celebrities, arguing it has devolved into puritanical tellings-off rather than meaningful analysis. Recent examples include criticism directed at Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae for their perceived transgressions against feminist ideals. The author contrasts this with the celebration of similar themes in older works, suggesting age and context influence perceptions. The piece argues that this online discourse, driven by algorithms rewarding extreme views, often lacks historical context and economic awareness, reverting to paternalistic policing of feminine sexuality.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. This follows the bill's passage in the House of Commons, although some peers express concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Under the proposed legislation, mentally competent, terminally ill adults with less than six months to live would be eligible, requiring two declarations and approval from two independent doctors and a multi-disciplinary panel. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the bill's rigorous safeguards and insists that disability or mental disorder would not qualify anyone for assisted dying.</p>

The testing will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using umbilical cord blood samples.

          <p>The House of Commons has backed a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a potentially colossal social change comparable to the Abortion Act of 1967. The bill now heads to the House of Lords, where its future is uncertain, although supporters hope the Lords will acknowledge the elected supremacy of the Commons. The government anticipates hundreds will seek an assisted death in the early years, potentially rising to around 4,000 annually after a decade. While opinion polls show significant public support for the change, some opponents express concerns about the bill's practicalities and terminology.</p>

          <p>Cities in eastern Germany are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation, as Anika Franze's experience in Guben demonstrates. Franze, originally from East Berlin, moved to Guben after participating in a "trial living" scheme, finding affordable housing and a quieter lifestyle. Similar projects have been launched in other towns in the Lusatia region, seeking to address demographic changes caused by declining birth rates and emigration. The initiative aims to make locations more attractive by providing incentives for businesses and fostering a welcoming culture, as Germany faces a reliance on migration to meet labor market demands.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their 2025 tour with a defeat to Argentina, highlighting the challenges of cohesion in a newly formed side. While the Lions showed ambition and created opportunities in attack, their execution was lacking, with offloads going to ground and passes missing their mark. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his frustration, emphasizing the need for sharper play as they head to Australia. The Lions attack felt like it should be judged in two different facets - ambition and execution.</p>

Shariyari allegedly supplied missiles to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Yemen's Houthis, and Izadi financed and armed Hamas during the October 7 attacks.
