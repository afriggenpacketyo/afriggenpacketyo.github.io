          <p>The de minimis trade loophole, allowing duty-free imports under $800, will end May 2nd.  Initially announced in February and then delayed, the change aims to counter unfair advantages for Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein.  The new tariffs will be either 30% of the value or $25 per item, increasing to $50 on June 1st. This addresses concerns about counterfeit goods and illicit substances.</p>
