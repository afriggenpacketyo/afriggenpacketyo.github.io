          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates after a disappointing ADP jobs report showed a significant drop in private payrolls. Trump criticized Powell for not cutting rates, asserting that Europe has lowered rates multiple times, and he has repeatedly hinted at potentially replacing Powell before his term ends. The ADP report indicated a substantial miss in job creation, heightening concerns about economic growth, and this call for lower rates underscores the ongoing tension between the former President and the Federal Reserve over monetary policy.

          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, *And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America*, argues that housing should be recognized as a human right to effectively address homelessness. The book examines the origins and perpetuation of the homelessness crisis, highlighting policy failures rather than personal shortcomings. It emphasizes that both Republican and Democratic administrations have contributed to systemic inequality through cuts to housing assistance and treating housing as a commodity. The book advocates for the "Housing First" model, prioritizing stable housing followed by support services, and asserts that acknowledging housing as a human right is essential for lasting change, arguing that homelessness is a societal choice. This perspective emphasizes the need for political will and systemic solutions.</p>

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, resigned from her role overseeing updates to the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Her resignation follows an order by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to force an update to the agency's guidance. The committee had been set to vote on updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines at a meeting later this month, before Kennedy usurped the process to impose his own changes to the guidance, and the article highlights the controversy surrounding the changes and the implications for public health. The article is serious in nature.</p>
