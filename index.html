          <p>The Uvalde school board has unanimously voted to release investigation records related to the 2022 Robb Elementary School mass shooting. This decision follows a court ruling in favor of news outlets and sustained pressure from victims' families, who have sought transparency for over three years. Board members expressed remorse for the delay, framing the release as a crucial step toward accountability and community healing. The move marks a significant shift from the board's previous legal resistance to making the documents public.</p>

          <p>A massive recall has been issued for over 5.2 million aboveground pools from brands like Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup due to a serious drowning hazard. The pools, sold by major retailers since 2002, feature external compression straps that can act as a foothold for small children, allowing unsupervised access to the water. This design flaw is linked to the drowning deaths of nine children in the U.S. between 2007 and 2022. Consumers are urged to contact the manufacturers for a free repair kit to replace the hazardous straps.</p>

          <p>China has initiated the construction of the world's largest hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which flows into India and Bangladesh as the Brahmaputra. The project, with a staggering 1.2 trillion yuan investment, is expected to generate three times the electricity of the Three Gorges Dam. This announcement triggered a significant surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure and hydropower companies, such as Power Construction Corporation of China. The project underscores China's focus on large-scale infrastructure and renewable energy development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump to strengthen security and economic cooperation amid China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. A key topic will be potential U.S. tariffs on Filipino goods, with the Philippines indicating readiness to negotiate a bilateral trade deal to avoid them. The meeting highlights the strategic importance of the U.S.-Philippines alliance in maintaining regional stability, particularly concerning territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

          <p>The race to develop and commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining renewed momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Stellantis setting production timelines before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a transitional step, critics note challenges like high costs and degradation. The recent progress in conventional battery technology from firms like CATL is also raising the bar for solid-state's value proposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An immersive London show called "Elvis Evolution" is facing backlash from attendees who feel it was misleadingly advertised.

While the creators, Layered Reality, state the concept evolved and they chose not to mimic Elvis's iconic performances, some fans have called the experience "atrocious" and are demanding refunds.

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's preference for using tariffs as a primary tool for foreign policy, often blurring the line with traditional sanctions. Unlike sanctions, tariffs can be deployed unilaterally and quickly to exert economic pressure, aligning with Trump's "America First" agenda to address trade deficits. The administration has used the threat of tariffs to influence non-trade issues like immigration and has targeted major trading partners, creating global market uncertainty. While this approach generates revenue, experts express concern over its potential to destabilize global trade and international relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the Western literary world's tendency to pigeonhole authors from the Balkans into writing about regional trauma and conflict. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to focus on "problematic" or "traumatic" themes specific to her culture, revealing an underlying assumption that the region is primarily a source of tragedy. Schnabl argues this expectation limits the scope of storytelling and reinforces stereotypes, preventing a more diverse and authentic range of voices from reaching a global audience. She calls for publishers to embrace universal human stories from the region.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly rent for a new tenancy in the UK has risen by £221, or 21%, over the past three years, reaching £1,283. This sharp increase, driven by high demand and insufficient supply, is forcing some tenants to make career decisions based on local rent costs and has led to more parents financially supporting their adult children. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, particularly in some cities, rents continue to rise sharply in more affordable areas, adding significant financial pressure on renters.

          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air images of China's J-35 stealth fighter provide strong evidence that the fifth-generation jet has entered production and is nearing operational readiness for the navy. The photos clearly show the aircraft with official naval markings, a "Flying Shark" tail insignia, and serial numbers, indicating they are part of an initial production run. According to military analysts, these details confirm the J-35's integration into the naval aviation force. The jets are expected to be deployed on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, significantly enhancing its naval combat capabilities.</p>

          <p>The preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has fueled controversy rather than providing closure. The report notes that both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off" moments after takeoff, causing a total loss of power. A cockpit recording captures one pilot asking the other why he did it, with the other denying it, but the report does not identify the speakers. This has led to widespread speculation and unverified media reports focusing on pilot error, which has been condemned as premature by investigators and pilot associations, who urge restraint until the full investigation is complete.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for using excessive force during the 2020 raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor.

Hankison is the only officer to face criminal conviction in connection with the fatal raid. The judge imposed prison time despite a Department of Justice recommendation against it, stating that not doing so would minimize the jury's guilty verdict.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 migrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The program grants them protection from deportation and work permits. While the court acknowledged that the plaintiffs have a plausible case, it found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues. This decision puts thousands of individuals, who fled war and civil unrest, at risk of deportation unless they can secure another form of legal status, alarming advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing President Trump of attempting to distract the public from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files with a series of unrelated and inflammatory social media posts. His recent focus on topics like the Washington Commanders' name change and attacks on political rivals is seen by some as a deliberate effort to shift the narrative. The accusations come as the administration faces backlash, including from its own base, for its handling of the promised release of documents related to the deceased sex offender. The White House maintains that the president is being transparent.</p>

The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the state fair.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, Donald Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining. They expose the economic hypocrisy and self-defeating internal trade barriers within other countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is creating an impetus for these nations to pursue domestic reforms and remove long-standing obstacles to their own internal commerce. The piece suggests this external shock is forcing a necessary re-evaluation of protectionist policies that have long hindered their own potential growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annie Farmer, a key witness against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, is urging the government to release all information related to the case, stating that if there is "nothing to hide," it should be made public.

Farmer remains skeptical of the Trump administration's handling of the files and is disturbed by calls to pardon Maxwell.

The number of unaccounted for individuals has been revised down to just three. The high initial count was largely due to tourists who left the area after the disaster without checking in. The flash floods, which killed at least 135 people, were particularly severe in Kerr County.
