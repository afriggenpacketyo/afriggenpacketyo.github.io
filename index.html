          <p>China's recent military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, revealed significant advancements in its military modernization. The event featured the public debut of new branches, including the Information Support Force, Military Aerospace Force, and Cyberspace Force, alongside their latest equipment. Analysts from institutions like the Rand Corporation suggest these developments indicate the People's Liberation Army is evolving into a force capable of joint operations across all domains. This display of strength signals Beijing's strategic focus on reshaping modern warfare through technological superiority.</p>

This achievement makes her the first woman to win back-to-back U.S. Open titles since Serena Williams accomplished the feat between 2012 and 2014, solidifying her position at the top of women's tennis.</p>

The event highlights the dangers of human-wildlife interactions in the region, where hippos are cited as a leading cause of fatal encounters and such boat accidents are unfortunately common.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party has publicly distanced itself from controversial claims made by a guest speaker at its conference. Dr. Aseem Malholtra, a cardiologist, suggested a "highly likely" link between COVID-19 vaccines and the recent cancer diagnoses of the King and the Princess of Wales. The remarks were immediately condemned as "shockingly irresponsible" by the health secretary, and medical experts have widely discredited such claims, stating there is no credible scientific evidence to support them. Reform UK stated that it does not endorse the comments but believes in free speech.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm, is moving westward across the Pacific Ocean with its path projected toward Hawaii. While no coastal watches or warnings are currently in effect, forecasters anticipate that swells generated by the hurricane will reach the Hawaiian Islands by Sunday. These swells are expected to create life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents through the middle of the week. In response to the potential threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency to prepare for possible impacts, including heavy rainfall and flooding.</p>

Conversely, in other areas, some residents expressed support for the plan, citing a desire for an end to criminal activity.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed the building was used by Hamas, a charge the group denies. This follows the destruction of another major tower the previous day, with Israel's Defence Minister posting a video of the collapse online. The IDF has repeated calls for Palestinian civilians to relocate to a designated humanitarian zone in the south, though the UN has described the area as overcrowded and unsafe.</p>

          <p>Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has publicly stated that President Trump should "absolutely" fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams accuses Kennedy of endangering the nation with "dangerous" policies, particularly regarding vaccines and his handling of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His comments follow recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director and advisory committee members, which Adams and other former surgeons general have warned jeopardizes public health and undermines the institution's integrity.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has asked a federal judge to deny a request from NBC News to unseal the names of two individuals who received large payments from Jeffrey Epstein in 2018. The two unnamed associates, described as potential co-conspirators, received $100,000 and $250,000 respectively, shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing its investigative series on Epstein. Federal prosecutors cited these payments as potential evidence of witness tampering. The DOJ is arguing for their names to remain sealed due to privacy concerns, which both individuals have expressly requested.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appeared to renew his threat to deploy troops to Chicago, this time focusing on a large-scale immigration enforcement operation. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump shared an image parodying the film "Apocalypse Now" with a caption about deportations and the "Department of WAR." This follows previous statements about sending the National Guard to combat crime in the city, similar to recent deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. State and local leaders in Illinois have condemned the threat, vowing legal resistance against what they call authoritarian tactics.</p>
