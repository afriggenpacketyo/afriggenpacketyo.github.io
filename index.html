          <p>UK retail sales experienced a significant drop in May, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance in supermarkets, according to official figures. Sales volumes decreased by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Food retailers saw reduced sales in alcohol and tobacco, reflecting household cutbacks, while clothing and household goods stores reported slow trading. Separate economic data revealed an increase in government borrowing last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since records began in 1993. (not investment advice)</p>

Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, where he was arrested last year for allegedly failing to moderate the app to reduce criminality, describing the charges as "totally absurd".

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft resigned as a government whip in response to the government's plans to cut disability benefits, stating that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution to addressing the welfare bill. The government defends its reforms as fixing a "broken welfare system" and ensuring support for those with severe disabilities while encouraging those who can work to do so. The proposed bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants. Foxcroft's resignation highlights divisions within the Labour party regarding the welfare reforms.</p>

The stock has fallen 11 per cent in two days, wiping out HK$36 billion (US$4.58 billion) in market value.

          <p>Right-wing populists are increasingly critical of cities due to their association with liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies. Figures like Donald Trump and others view cities as corrupted by lawlessness and immorality, advocating for intervention to restore order. This animosity stems from a sense of defeat as cities have shifted from conservative strongholds to centers of the center-left. While cities offer opportunities for work and entrepreneurship, their fluid loyalties and complex politics clash with the populist emphasis on tradition and national identity. The urban resistance to right-wing populism is seen as a valuable act of defiance.</p>

Despite the court's decision, Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta remain committed to challenging Trump's use of the military for domestic law enforcement.

The court stated that Trump's administration had presented a defensible rationale for mobilizing the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property. Newsom criticized Trump's decision to send troops to quell anti-immigration protests, calling it an authoritarian move.

The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, stated that recent affirmations of frugality are intended to limit extravagant practices, not ordinary dining. Some local governments were scrutinizing every meal gathering, which has complicated understanding of the regulations and brought unnecessary shocks to the catering industry. Curbs on perceived excess in official meals spread across the country in May after the party’s Central Committee released their “Regulations on Practicing Thrift and Opposing Waste in Party and Government Bodies”.</p>

Farrell's ability to give clarity and confidence to those who come into his orbit extended to the British and Irish Lions decision-makers, who unanimously backed him as the man to lead this summer's tour to Australia.

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that extends the shelf life of fruits by 2½ times by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating was tested on 17 varieties of fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes. The coating effectively delays rot by almost a week or more, at a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. The new strategy reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste.</p>

          <p>China has criticized the UK for a warship's patrol in the Taiwan Strait, calling it an intentional provocation that undermines peace and stability. The British Royal Navy says HMS Spey's patrol was part of a long-planned deployment and in accordance with international law. China considers Taiwan its territory and opposes any country using freedom of navigation as a pretext to threaten China's sovereign security. Taiwan's foreign ministry has praised the patrol as an act that safeguarded the freedom of navigation in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan more than doubled in May, spiking 101.7% year over year and marking their largest increase in over half a century. The surge in rice prices comes as Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, marking its highest level since January 2023. Japan's rice prices have been in the spotlight in recent times, with the government releasing emergency stockpiles to moderate the price of the country's staple food. The government's recent measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending in the real economy. (not investment advice)</p>
