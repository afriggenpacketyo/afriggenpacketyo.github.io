The rallies highlight the deep divisions and high tensions in the UK over the conflict, as the British government also faces criticism for its plan to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

The fire, exacerbated by high temperatures and wind, is part of a broader trend of intense wildfires across Europe, with similar incidents recently occurring in Spain and France, linked to intensifying summer heatwaves.</p>

The FDA has also issued a recommendation to control a concentrated kratom byproduct, 7-OH, due to its abuse potential, though the maker of Feel Free claims this does not affect its natural leaf product.</p>

The controversy drew criticism from Mexico's president, prompting Adidas to remove promotional images and engage in discussions with Oaxacan officials about making restitution for the oversight.</p>

          <p>According to historian Rana Mitter of the Harvard Kennedy School, the immense destruction China suffered during World War II is a frequently underestimated factor in shaping its modern trajectory. The war shattered the nation's infrastructure, forcing a near-total restart of its development in the post-war era. This historical context, Mitter suggests, helps explain China's contemporary interests, which he argues are fundamentally aligned with maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region to avoid a repeat of such devastation.</p>

          <p>A violent attack at a nightclub in Ecuador's coastal Guayas province has left eight people dead and three others injured, according to authorities. Heavily armed assailants reportedly arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles and opened fire on the patrons. This incident is the latest in a wave of extreme violence sweeping the country, which officials attribute to disputes between organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels. Ecuador has recorded over 4,000 homicides in the first five months of 2025, with several coastal provinces under a state of emergency.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's plan to take military control of Gaza City, asserting it is the "best way" to defeat Hamas and end the war. His defense came as Israel faced heavy criticism at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, where nations like the UK and France warned the plan could violate international law and endanger hostages. At the meeting, UN officials described a dire humanitarian situation of "starvation, pure and simple," while the U.S. defended Israel's right to act and blamed Hamas for the conflict's continuation.</p>

          <h2>Twenty Years After California Law, Farmworkers Still Face Deadly Risks from Extreme Heat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 14:46:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a landmark California law enacted two decades ago to protect outdoor laborers, farmworkers continue to suffer from preventable heat-related illnesses and deaths. A recent state audit and multiple reports highlight an ineffective enforcement system, with few penalties imposed on employers even in fatal cases. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, advocates and some legislators argue that many workers, particularly those who are undocumented, are reluctant to report unsafe conditions for fear of retaliation, leaving them dangerously vulnerable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor James van der Beek, 48, has revealed that the first warning sign of his stage 3 colorectal cancer was a subtle change in his bowel movements, which he initially dismissed. The "Dawson’s Creek" star, who was diagnosed in 2024, said he was otherwise healthy and unaware that the recommended screening age had dropped to 45. Medical experts confirm that such changes are a primary red flag and emphasize the importance of screening, as many colorectal cancers develop silently and can be advanced by the time obvious symptoms appear.</p>

          <p>Emirates Airlines has announced a ban on the in-flight use of portable chargers, or power banks, following a comprehensive safety review and a series of fire-related incidents across the aviation industry. The airline cited a growing number of onboard events linked to lithium batteries as the reason for the new, proactive policy. This move follows recent scares on KLM and Delta flights where power banks caught fire, and adds Emirates to a growing list of carriers, including Southwest and Lufthansa, that are implementing stricter rules on these devices.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly shooting at its Atlanta headquarters, the union representing CDC employees has demanded the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation, which it says puts staff at risk. The gunman, who killed a police officer, was reportedly motivated by a belief that the COVID-19 vaccine had harmed him. The union stated the attack "compounds months of vilification" and called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a clear stance to reinforce public trust in science and prevent future violence against scientists.</p>

          <p>A new series from NPR examines the significant shifts occurring in the global system, often referred to as the "liberal international order," which has been in place since World War II. This order, characterized by U.S. leadership, multilateralism, and globalization, is now fracturing due to the resurgence of authoritarian powers and changing global alliances. The series will explore how many countries, including U.S. allies, are preparing for a future with waning American influence, leading to new dynamics in global defense and security.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has escalated the conflict over a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan, threatening that the standoff with Democrats "could literally last years." Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the new maps, which could add five GOP seats in Congress. Abbott stated he will call continuous 30-day special legislative sessions and have the lawmakers arrested upon their return, while Democratic governors from other states have vowed to support their Texas colleagues and fight back.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has defended his government's decision to suspend the export of arms to Israel that could be used in its Gaza offensive, despite criticism from within his own conservative party. Merz stated that while Germany's solidarity with Israel is unchanged, it cannot supply weapons for a conflict where many civilians could be killed, a move prompted by Israel's plan to take over Gaza City. The decision marks a significant policy shift for Germany, one of Israel's staunchest allies, as Israel faces growing international condemnation for its war conduct.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing internal and external turmoil regarding its process for approving new drugs, particularly for rare diseases. The recent case of Sarepta Therapeutics highlights the dilemma: the agency granted accelerated approval for a costly gene therapy despite limited data, a decision praised for its nimbleness but later questioned after three patient deaths. This situation exemplifies the intense pressure the FDA is under to balance rapid access to innovative treatments with the rigorous safety and efficacy standards expected of a regulator.</p>
