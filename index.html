          <p>Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist known for unmasking Russian spies, found himself in Vladimir Putin's crosshairs after revealing the agents behind the Aleksei Navalny poisoning. Putin sought to have Grozev killed, enlisting a disgraced financier recruited by Russian intelligence for the task. However, the team assembled by the financier was apprehended, and the financier now resides in Moscow, facing the consequences of his failed mission. The article underscores the dangers faced by those who speak truth to power and the lengths to which autocratic regimes will go to silence dissent. Optimism is tempered by the recognition of the vulnerability of individuals facing unchecked power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to proceed with plans to lay off thousands of federal workers across nearly two dozen agencies. This request comes as a legal battle continues over the president's efforts to drastically reduce the size of the government. The Justice Department argues that a lower court's order halting the layoffs interferes with the executive branch's authority to oversee personnel decisions. Labor unions and other groups have sued to block the layoffs, arguing that the executive order exceeds the president's authority and violates the separation of powers.</p>

This lengthy process adds too many details to the equation, making people acutely aware of what they'd be giving up, ultimately making the decision harder.

She claimed the shift began after the “Signalgate” controversy, where Hegseth allegedly shared sensitive military details in a group chat.

          <p>More than 50 people were killed and scores wounded in an attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Witnesses reported being fired at from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli military denied its forces were involved. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated it delivered aid without incident, dismissing reports of deaths and injuries. The incident occurred amidst faltering ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, with both sides trading blame.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, the active volcano on the Italian island of Sicily, erupted on Monday, spewing hot ash and lava. The nation's volcano monitoring body reported explosions of increasing intensity and a lava fountain from the southeast crater. While the area around the summit was blocked off as a precaution, there were no reports of any risk to the local population or air travel. Etna is considered the most active volcano in Europe, and eruptions are frequent, although typically causing no major problems.</p>
