            <p>President Trump backtracked on his proposed tariffs, implementing a 90-day pause for most nations except China, after observing market volatility and unease. He attributed the change to people getting "a little bit afraid" and acknowledged watching the bond market selloff. Trump emphasized the need for flexibility and indicated that the pause had been under consideration, signaling a willingness to negotiate fair deals with other countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent framed the reversal as a strategic move to create leverage for negotiations, while White House officials highlighted the administration's long-term focus on American workers.

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally remove alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act without legal process. However, the court narrowed the path for detainees to challenge their removal, requiring them to seek review through a writ of habeas corpus. The ruling leaves the fate of those already incarcerated in a Salvadoran prison uncertain. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the administration's actions as an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.</p>

While tariffs on China increased, tariffs on Vietnam and India were reduced, raising the possibility that Apple will be able to serve a large percentage of its U.S. customers from factories outside of China with lower tariffs.

The attractions will reset the bar and the expectations of guests. The park, however, is noted to be more collection of properties rather than spaces to explore larger concepts.</p>

            <p>House Republicans narrowly advanced a budget plan key to extending President Trump's tax cuts. The budget resolution still faces a final vote later Wednesday, and it's unclear whether it has enough support to clear the last hurdle. Mr. Trump told GOP holdouts to "close your eyes and get there." The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that "they always vote in unison," saying, "you don't see somebody that's holding up."</p>
