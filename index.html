        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This outburst followed a ruling against Trump's tariffs by a panel of judges, including one appointed by Trump, which cited right-leaning legal theories. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, suggesting they provided poor advice on judicial nominations and accused Leo of pursuing his own ambitions through the Teneo Network, aiming to challenge liberal dominance across various sectors. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the federal courts. Optimism regarding the tone of this article is low due to the serious nature of the allegations and the potential implications for the conservative legal movement.</p>

Laatsch allegedly transcribed classified information into a notepad at his desk, hid it in his socks and lunchbox, and planned to deliver it via thumb drive.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, providing the administration with some breathing room. The Trump administration had indicated it would seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the tariffs were not quickly reinstated. The initial ruling destabilized Trump's economic agenda, with Trump officials insisting they have alternative methods for imposing tariffs if they do not prevail in the case. The appeals court has given the plaintiffs one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan, ending a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports expected to begin once China completes necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. China had halted seafood imports in 2023, citing risks to the fishing industry and coastal communities, despite Japan's assurances that the discharge met international safety standards.</p>

          <p>Nika Melia, a key figure in Georgia's largest opposition group, Coalition for Change, has been detained by police, accused of insulting law enforcement officers. This is the second such detention in recent days, following the pre-trial detention of another Coalition for Change leader, Zurab Japaridze. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of adopting authoritarian tactics and steering the country away from Europe and towards Russia. The government denies these allegations, while membership in the European Union remains a popular goal among Georgians.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Elon Musk is concluding his official role in the administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but suggests Musk will continue to assist in some capacity. Musk's government service is ending due to the legal limit for his "special government employee" designation. DOGE, created by executive order, has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts. Despite criticism from Democrats, markets have responded positively to Musk's return to the private sector, with Tesla shares rising.</p>

          <h2>Hamas Rejects New US Gaza Ceasefire Plan Backed by Israel</h2>

          <p>A senior Hamas official has stated that the group rejects the latest US proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, despite the White House's claim that Israel has "signed off" on it. The official said the proposal did not satisfy core demands, including an end to the war. The Israeli government has not commented, but Prime Minister Netanyahu reportedly told hostages' families that he accepted the plan. The UN reports that nearly 4,000 people have been killed in Gaza over the past 10 weeks and that 500,000 people face catastrophic levels of hunger in the coming months.</p>
