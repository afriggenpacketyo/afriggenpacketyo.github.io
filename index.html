          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Portland. The judge ruled that the president lacked a "colorable basis" to federalize the troops, stating that local law enforcement could execute federal laws and that protests were not significantly violent. This decision highlights a legal clash over the balance of power between federal and state governments regarding military use in domestic law enforcement.</p>

This move follows an incident where federal agents shot an armed woman after vehicles reportedly rammed law enforcement vehicles. Illinois Governor J.B.

          <p>Glaciers globally are rapidly retreating, with Switzerland's glaciers losing a quarter of their ice in the last decade, and 450 billion tonnes lost worldwide in 2024.

This loss threatens water resources for hundreds of millions, particularly in Asia, though limiting global warming to 1.5C could preserve half of the remaining ice.</p>

          <p>A recent explosion and fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery, which unnerved South Bay communities, has highlighted the facility's extensive history of safety and environmental violations. Environmental advocates fear the ongoing federal government shutdown will prevent thorough investigations by agencies like OSHA and the defunded U.S. Chemical Safety Board, potentially obscuring the incident's root causes. This situation underscores broader concerns about industrial safety and the capacity for accountability during government funding impasses.</p>

          <p>An FBI agent has been suspended for insubordination after reportedly refusing to participate in a "perp walk" for former FBI Director James Comey, deeming the plan inappropriate. Comey was indicted on federal charges days after President Trump publicly called for investigations into political adversaries. The planned public escort of Comey to his arraignment, possibly by "large, beefy" agents, has sparked controversy regarding the politicization of law enforcement and the treatment of high-profile individuals.</p>

          <p>Billionaire populist Andrej Babis' ANO party won the Czech parliamentary elections with nearly 35% of the vote, securing 80 seats but falling short of an overall majority. Babis, a former prime minister, is expected to lead coalition talks, potentially with eurosceptic parties like the Motorists for Themselves and Freedom and Direct Democracy. While celebrating a "historic success," the path to forming a stable government faces challenges due to differing policy priorities, particularly regarding EU and NATO membership.</p>

          <p>U.S. national parks are experiencing significant disruptions due to the ongoing government shutdown, with many operating under reduced staff or closing entirely.

          <p>Hundreds of extra police officers have been deployed to Manchester to reassure communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack, which killed two Jewish men. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed officers are working extended shifts, with support from other forces, amid the ongoing Conservative Party Conference. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police after ramming a car into people and attempting to force entry into the synagogue, having been recently bailed after an arrest for sexual assault.</p>

Worshippers and security staff bravely prevented the attacker from entering the building. Police are treating the incident as a terror attack, believing Al-Shamie may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology and had a history including a recent arrest for sexual assault.</p>

This policy, drawing inspiration from US immigration enforcement, aims to deter illegal entry and is part of the party's broader strategy to address immigration concerns and differentiate itself from rivals.</p>
