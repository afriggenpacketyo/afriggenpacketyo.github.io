          <p>House Republicans moved forward with President Trump's budget package after overcoming initial resistance from conservatives who felt the spending cuts weren't deep enough. Negotiations between Republican leadership and the conservative holdouts resulted in compromises, leading to a second vote by the House Budget Committee where the bill advanced. Speaker Mike Johnson indicated that minor modifications would be made to the legislation. The bill now moves closer to a floor vote before the Memorial Day deadline, marking a key step in enacting Trump's domestic policy agenda.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations, signaling that consumption remains a concern for the world's second-largest economy. Industrial output grew 6.1% year-on-year, stronger than expected, but fixed-asset investment expanded by only 4.0%. The real estate sector continued to drag on investment, falling 10.3% for the year. These figures come amid the backdrop of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, although trade-war fears have receded after recent negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine holds a unique secret: its interior is covered in 70-year-old frescoes, leading some to call it the "Sistine Chapel of Maine." Painted by artists in the 1950s, the murals depict biblical scenes and have recently gained renewed interest thanks to a website created by Colby College students. The meeting house, built in 1842, serves as a space for community gatherings and artistic events. Artists involved in the original project recall their idyllic time painting the frescoes, which continue to inspire art lovers today.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office.

While the cancer is Stage 4 and incurable, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, and supportive statements have been issued by both President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a perfectly spherical bubble in the Milky Way galaxy, named Teleios, using a powerful radio telescope. While identified as a supernova remnant, the object's origin is puzzling due to uncertain distance estimates and a lack of expected X-ray emissions. Researchers suggest it could be a Type Ia or Type Iax supernova remnant, but further observations are needed to determine its evolutionary history. The near-perfect symmetry of Teleios also adds to its intrigue, as supernova remnants are typically asymmetrical.</p>

          <p>The United States is likely to introduce region-based tariffs instead of individual duty rates for many countries, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The Trump administration aims to strike deals with key trading partners on reciprocal tariffs imposed in April, focusing on regional agreements. This approach comes as the deadline for negotiations nears, with the administration sending letters to numerous countries about the terms for doing business with the United States. Bessent emphasized that the April tariff rates would be reinstated if trading partners do not negotiate in good faith.</p>
