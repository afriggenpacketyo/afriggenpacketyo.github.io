          <p>President Trump has nominated Vice Adm. Brad Cooper to lead U.S. Central Command, replacing Gen. Michael Kurilla, and Lt. Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson to head U.S. Africa Command, succeeding Gen. Michael Langley. Cooper, who previously led naval forces for CENTCOM, oversaw strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen and helped build a humanitarian pier off Gaza. Trump aims to restore stability in the Middle East, a goal challenged by the ongoing conflict in Gaza and stalled nuclear deal negotiations with Iran. Cooper led 100 strikes in Houthi-controlled portions of Yemen, destroying the group's drone and missile capabilities that the Houthis used to harass commercial ships in the Red Sea. Kurilla led U.S. military operations to defend Israel against attacks from Iran.</p>

          <p>A Miami-Dade College course for high school students, titled "Preparing for Student Success," included a controversial questionnaire that asked students about their sexuality, including questions about heterosexuality. The assignment included questions such as "What do you think caused your heterosexuality?" and "Is it possible that being straight is just a phase you may grow out of?" Parents expressed outrage, calling the assignment inappropriate and perverse, with one mother stating she would call the police if someone asked her son such questions. The college has since reviewed the assignment and determined it will no longer be used, emphasizing its commitment to a safe and respectful learning environment. The questions were derived from a textbook featuring a questionnaire developed by a gay-rights activist in 1972.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries agrees with Elon Musk's description of President Trump's domestic policy bill as a "disgusting abomination," citing the bill's cuts to Medicaid and nutritional assistance. Jeffries criticizes the bill for taking away healthcare from millions of Americans and reducing food assistance for children, veterans, and seniors, all while providing tax breaks for billionaires. Musk's criticism focuses on the bill's high cost, while Jeffries emphasizes the cuts to social programs, both pointing to a "Republican civil war." The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, imposes work requirements on Medicaid recipients, restricts food stamps, and increases border spending, facing opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation restricting travel from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Chad, and Iran, citing national security concerns; the ban fully restricts entry of nationals from those countries, with some exceptions for lawful permanent residents and those traveling on diplomatic visas. Additionally, the proclamation places heightened restrictions on visitors from seven other countries, including Burundi, Cuba, and Venezuela. White House officials stated the action is due to a high level of risk to the United States, with the ban taking effect Monday; this action follows an attack in Boulder, Colorado, raising attention for Israelis taken hostage by Hamas. The new restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting or fail to share necessary information, reflecting Trump's promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors. The administration believes these measures are in the best interest of American safety.</p>

          <p>A former marketing executive, Chad Bustos, is suing Terranea Resort, alleging he was fired for opposing discriminatory comments made by the resort's president, Ralph Grippo, towards pregnant women. Bustos claims Grippo made inappropriate inquiries about the pregnancy status of female employees and scrutinized their performance after one announced her maternity leave. Bustos reported Grippo's behavior to human resources and confronted him directly, after which Grippo allegedly ostracized and eventually fired him. The lawsuit claims Grippo had a history of making anti-pregnancy comments, including questioning women about balancing work and motherhood during promotion or job interviews. Under California law, employers are prohibited from asking employees about medical conditions, including pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Two men suspected of bombing a Palm Springs fertility clinic last month allegedly used a generative artificial intelligence chat program to help plan the attack, according to the FBI. Records show that Guy Edward Bartkus, the primary suspect, researched how to make powerful explosions using ammonium nitrate and fuel using an AI application. This marks the second case this year where law enforcement has cited the use of AI in assisting with a bombing or attempted bombing. Tech companies are reportedly taking shortcuts in safety testing AI models before public release, raising concerns about misuse. The use of generative AI has soared in recent years, leading to increased scrutiny and development of safety measures.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's tax and spending bill, describing it as a "disgusting abomination" and urging Americans to tell lawmakers to "kill the bill." Musk argues the bill will increase the US budget deficit and burden citizens with unsustainable debt, reflecting wider tensions within the Republican Party. The White House defended the bill, asserting it dramatically improves the fiscal trajectory and unleashes economic growth, denying claims of higher deficits. Musk's comments mark his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving the administration's cost-cutting team, known as Doge. The bill has been estimated to increase the budget deficit by about $600 billion in the next fiscal year and includes tax cuts, increased defense spending, and funding for mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Denmark has become a pioneer in restrictive migration policies, driven by the center-left Social Democrats under Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who argue that high migration levels threaten social cohesion and welfare. This shift occurred after the 2015 European migration crisis, during which the anti-immigration Danish People's Party gained significant power. Denmark has since implemented measures such as processing asylum seekers outside the continent and tightening rules on family reunions. Frederiksen's policies have been successful in winning votes, but critics argue they have damaged Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law and the rights of asylum-seekers.</p>

Jewish leaders emphasize the need for more than symbolic gestures, advocating for inclusive school environments and better training for educators to recognize and respond to antisemitism. The Jewish community has invested in partnerships with other communities, but feels it is shouldering the burden alone, calling for a city-wide solution to address hate.</p>

          <p>Jared Isaacman, after his nomination for NASA was withdrawn by President Trump, stated that his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience." Isaacman is resigning as CEO of Shift4 Payments to become executive chairman. Trump withdrew Isaacman's nomination after a review of prior associations, possibly related to Isaacman's past donations to Democrats and Elon Musk's criticism of Trump's tax-cut bill. Isaacman, who has close ties to Elon Musk, suggested the timing of the withdrawal was not a coincidence, aligning with Musk's departure from government service. Musk became a vocal critic of Trump's tax bill, prompting Trump's decision to pull Isaacman's nomination.</p>

He argues that the U.S. government encouraged outsourcing to China for decades, resulting in a weak negotiating position.

          <p>President Trump met with Senate Republicans to bolster support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a legislative package advancing his agenda. Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated that Republicans are unified in their efforts to pass the bill, despite opposition from Elon Musk. The bill includes extending the 2017 tax cuts, increasing military and border security spending, and making cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Trump aims to secure passage of the bill by July 4th, but faces challenges due to concerns among Senate Republicans.</p>

          <p>Despite college graduation ceremonies being a time of celebration, skepticism about the value of higher education persists, with confidence in colleges declining over the past decade. A recent report indicates that only one in four Americans believes a four-year degree is essential for a well-paying job. The unemployment rate for recent college graduates is at its highest since 2021, further fueling doubts. While immediate post-pandemic trends may influence recent unemployment stats, questions about the benefit of a college degree predate the pandemic, with the earnings gap between college graduates and high school graduates remaining consistent since 2010.</p>
