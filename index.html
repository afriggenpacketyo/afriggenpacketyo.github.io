          <p>Thousands of residents have fled Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood amid relentless Israeli bombardment, which the local municipality describes as a catastrophic situation. The humanitarian crisis is deepening across the territory, with the UN reporting widespread displacement and malnutrition, and aid agencies struggling to deliver supplies. In Israel, a general strike is planned to protest the government's military strategy, with families of hostages arguing that the expanding war endangers those held captive by Hamas. The Israeli military has stated it will resume allowing tents into Gaza in preparation for further displacement of the population.</p>

          <p>British featherweight Lerone Murphy has positioned himself as a top contender for the UFC title after a spectacular first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319 in Chicago. Murphy, who accepted the fight on just three weeks' notice, used a spinning back elbow to secure the victory and extend his undefeated career record to 17 wins. Following the impressive performance, which earned him a $50,000 bonus, Murphy called for a championship bout against current titleholder Alexander Volkanovski.

          <p>The Canadian government has forced an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, ordering both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve their contract dispute. The intervention came less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began, which had already started to strand thousands of travelers during the peak summer season. The government cited risks to the economy as the reason for the swift action, a move the union condemned as a violation of their constitutional right to strike. Air Canada has warned that it could take up to a week to fully restore its operations.</p>

          <p>Rescue workers in northwestern Pakistan are intensifying relief efforts after severe flash floods killed more than 220 people in the Buner district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The disaster was triggered by torrential monsoon rains and cloudbursts, which caused widespread landslides and destroyed homes, including one incident where 24 members of a single family died. The provincial government has announced financial aid for the victims' families while working to clear roads and deliver essential supplies. Pakistan's disaster management authority has warned that more heavy rains are expected, heightening the risk of further flooding.</p>

          <p>A cold case detective successfully captured the notorious "canal killer" through an undercover sting operation at a Phoenix Chili's restaurant in 2015. The detective posed as a security consultant to meet with suspect Bryan Patrick Miller, a local performer known as the "Zombie Hunter," with the sole purpose of obtaining his DNA from a used water glass. Although the detective was initially skeptical that the mild-mannered father could be the killer, the DNA proved to be a direct match to evidence from the 1990s murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Miller was subsequently arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new trade policy allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to Chinese companies, provided they share 15% of their revenue from these sales with the U.S. government. This move marks a significant shift from previous export bans and has been criticized by trade experts who fear it sets a dangerous precedent that national security controls are for sale. While the White House frames it as a "revenue-sharing" agreement, the deal's legality is still being examined, as it could be considered an export tax. The policy reflects a transactional approach to the ongoing technological rivalry between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, with a specific focus on emphasizing the artist's "Russianness." The collection, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, showcases key periods of Repin's life and career within the Russian Empire. This presentation of the artist's identity comes amid a cultural dispute, as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also declared the works of Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, to be a part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition's design elements are intended to evoke his formative years in St Petersburg.</p>

The campaign, which played on the words "genes" and "jeans," sparked a divided response, with some critics calling it tone-deaf and alleging racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not commented on the controversy, posted photos from a night out with friends.

          <p>A long-standing principle known as the "85th percentile rule" is facing increased scrutiny as states and safety advocates push for new ways to set speed limits. The rule suggests that speed limits should be based on the speed that 85% of drivers are already traveling at or below, a concept critics argue creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits. Amid a rise in traffic fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that communities should also consider factors like pedestrian activity and crash frequency. This has prompted some cities to lower residential speed limits, though the traditional method remains influential.</p>

The technique prepares what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original shape while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. This process creates a glassy solid at low temperatures that maintains its structural integrity. The breakthrough promises to provide scientists with highly accurate and vivid three-dimensional views of organs and could be stored long-term for future study.</p>

Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's mistakes to clinch the head-to-head season series, an important tiebreaker.

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that features a single, centrally mounted "scissor wing" capable of rotating up to 90 degrees. This innovative concept aims to optimize performance across different speeds, a long-standing challenge in aviation. The wing would sit perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift during takeoff, pivot to 45 degrees to mitigate shock waves at transonic speeds, and align parallel to the body at hypersonic speeds. In its Mach 5 configuration, the entire aircraft would function as a highly efficient "waverider," generating lift from its own shock waves.</p>

          <p>Colorado dentist James Craig has been charged with first-degree murder for allegedly poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, who died after a mysterious two-week illness. Prosecutors allege Craig researched and purchased poisons like arsenic and potassium cyanide online before administering them to his wife through her daily protein shakes. The investigation was triggered after a suspicious package containing cyanide was delivered to his dental office. Authorities suggest that motives for the murder included significant financial debt and an affair Craig had started with an orthodontist he met shortly before his wife fell ill.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Explains Five Common Psychological Triggers for Infidelity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples therapist and executive counselor explains that people who risk their careers and families for an affair are often not malicious but are reacting to deep-seated psychological pressures. The article outlines five common catalysts: a lifetime of repressing emotions to be "good," perfectionism developed as a response to trauma, and poor boundaries learned in childhood. Other significant triggers include being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage, or experiencing a recent, profound loss. These situations can create an emotional void or a desire for release that makes an affair seem like a justifiable escape.</p>

          <p>A small private airplane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego after experiencing mechanical issues. The aircraft was on a short flight between Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport and Miramar Marine Corps Air Station when the incident occurred. The pilot was able to land the plane on the highway without causing any injuries to people on the ground or to anyone on board the aircraft. The landing prompted a temporary closure of the highway's southbound lanes while authorities investigated and removed the plane, but traffic has since been fully restored.</p>
