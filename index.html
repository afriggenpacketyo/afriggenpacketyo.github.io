          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be attending the potential peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv in Turkey. The Kremlin announced that the Russian delegation would be led by presidential advisor Vladimir Medinsky. President Trump also indicated he would skip the talks, despite previously considering joining the meeting, and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would attend. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was waiting to see who would come from Russia before deciding what steps Ukraine should take regarding the peace talks.

          <p>Smartmatic alleges that Fox News executives, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, destroyed text messages relevant to the 2020 election claims. Smartmatic sued Fox in 2021, claiming the network knowingly lied about the company in the wake of the 2020 election regarding claims of voting machine fraud, causing Smartmatic to lose business. Fox argues it was covering newsworthy allegations made by President Trump and accuses Smartmatic of seeking profit through the lawsuit. The filing comes after a judge ruled Fox could access documents related to a DOJ investigation into Smartmatic executives. Fox denies the allegations and accuses Smartmatic of failing to preserve evidence, including instructions from its CEO to delete relevant texts.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded healthcare benefits in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. This decision is driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies. While the freeze does not affect those already enrolled, new applicants will be ineligible for Medi-Cal starting in 2026. Additionally, starting in 2027, adults with 'unsatisfactory immigration status' on Medi-Cal will have to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom's office estimates these changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has fired two high-ranking officials at the National Intelligence Council (NIC) after the council released a memo contradicting Donald Trump’s justification for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members. Gabbard's office stated the firings were due to the officials' opposition to the president, aiming to end the politicization of the intelligence community. The declassified memo found no coordination between Venezuela’s government and the Tren de Aragua gang, which the Trump administration had cited as reasoning for invoking the Alien Enemies Act. The move has prompted concern, with some suggesting that intelligence analysis may now be contingent on aligning with the President’s political agenda.</p>

Jaime-Flores admitted that she and Torres opposed the immigration agent’s activities, and a photo found on her phone showed a message urging others to join the fight against immigration officials.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to weaken limits on some "forever chemicals" (PFAS) in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be scrapped and reconsidered. The EPA will keep standards for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion but give utilities two extra years to comply. Health advocates criticize the move, while water utilities support it, citing expensive treatment systems.

Al-Sharaa's rebel forces led the charge on Damascus last year that toppled Bashar al-Assad, and he has since installed himself as the head of a government presenting itself to the world as inclusive and democratic. Mr. Trump urged him to join Saudi Arabia in signing onto the U.S.-backed Abraham Accords, to normalize ties with Israel. The Trump administration appears to be pushing for normalized relations with the new government in Syria in the hope it can help curb Iranian influence in the country and the wider Middle East, despite Sharaa's roots in extremism.</p>

Their defense invoked the criminal justice policies of the 1990s and argued that under today’s mores the brothers merited a second chance.

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress against the opioid crisis.

Despite the positive trend, the Trump administration is proposing cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released their final report on a June 2023 plane crash that killed four people, stating the likely cause was "pilot incapacitation due to loss of cabin pressure for undetermined reasons." The report cited the pilot's and owner/operator's decision to operate the airplane without supplemental oxygen as a contributing factor. Investigators were unable to determine whether the loss of cabin pressure happened quickly or over time. The plane likely continued on autopilot until it ran out of fuel.</p>

The attacks have led to worsening power blackouts, as well as city residents facing water shortages.
