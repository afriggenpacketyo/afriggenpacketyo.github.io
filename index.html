          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant rally following President Trump's indication that tariffs on China would be reduced substantially, coupled with his statement that he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 625 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also saw substantial gains. Tesla shares surged after Elon Musk announced his reduced involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency, allowing him to refocus on the electric car company. This shift in tone from the White House boosted investor confidence after market downturns earlier in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck Istanbul, Turkey, causing widespread concern but no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries. The quake, centered in the Sea of Marmara, prompted many residents to evacuate buildings and seek information. While authorities canceled public holiday events, initial assessments indicated limited structural damage, though some buildings may be at risk due to the area's density. Turkey is prone to earthquakes due to its location on major fault lines, recalling the devastating 2023 earthquake that caused widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>

          <h2>IMF Forecasts Slight Dip in U.S. Fiscal Deficit Due to Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that U.S. tariffs will contribute to a slight decrease in the country's fiscal deficit in 2025, despite worsening growth and inflation outlooks. The narrower deficit is contingent on higher tariff revenues, though the magnitude of this increase remains uncertain. The IMF acknowledges that tariffs could also lead to a wider economic slowdown, potentially offsetting the higher revenues. Rising U.S. government debt could also push up longer-term interest rates.</p>

          <p>The European Union is considering a proposal to impose export restrictions on all eel species under an international agreement regulating trade in endangered species, which could affect supplies to Japan. The proposal aims to address the ongoing smuggling of European eels and normalize trade in Japanese and American eels. The EU is seeking to list all 19 eel species and subspecies in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

          <p>Experts are concerned that the resumption of student loan collections from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the economy, particularly with the elevated risk of a recession. Roughly 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections beginning on May 5, which could reduce consumer spending. While the impact may be smaller than other economic factors, it could compound existing challenges. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. economic activity.</p>
