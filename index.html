          <p>A 59-year-old New York City employee died in an explosion on a boat carrying raw sewage on the Hudson River. Another worker was injured and hospitalized, while a third declined medical treatment. The incident occurred near the North River wastewater treatment plant, and the cause is under investigation, though authorities do not suspect criminal intent. Mayor Eric Adams mourned the loss of the 33-year veteran of the cityâ€™s environmental protection department, while the blast, which spread sewage, required first responders to be decontaminated. The article reports that the men on the boat were performing work involving a flame or sparks at the time of the explosion, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a 37-year-old crypto investor, and Beatrice Folchi were arrested in New York City in connection with the kidnapping and torture of an Italian tourist. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was allegedly lured to Woeltz's SoHo home under the pretense of retrieving Bitcoin he had been forced to send the suspect. Prosecutors detailed the graphic nature of the alleged torture, including electric shocks, cuts with a saw, and forced crack cocaine use. The victim managed to escape and flag down a traffic agent, leading to Woeltz's arrest on charges including kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a firearm, while Folchi was taken into custody on one count each of first-degree kidnapping and first-degree unlawful imprisonment.</p>

          <p>A British fishing vessel has been impounded by French authorities for allegedly fishing illegally in French waters. The French coast guard stated that the vessel was found operating without a license during inspections by the navy patrol vessel Pluvier. The vessel was diverted to Boulogne for prosecution, prompting a response from the UK Foreign Office, which is offering support to the British national involved and is in contact with French authorities. This incident occurs shortly after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced criticism regarding a deal with the EU granting EU fishing vessels access to UK waters for 12 more years.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a California mother and bank manager, was kidnapped with her daughter and forced to rob her own bank in 2000. The perpetrators strapped fake dynamite to them, demanding she steal money from the vault, leading to a terrifying ordeal. After the crime, Michelle was initially treated as a suspect, with investigators scrutinizing her past, including her previous work as a stripper, and financial difficulties. Despite overwhelming evidence of her innocence, defense attorneys attacked her credibility during the trial of the kidnappers, painting her as a criminal, but the real perpetrators were eventually convicted, and Michelle and her daughter have since become advocates for trauma survivors, sharing their story of resilience.</p>

          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, Japanese hospitals continue to enforce strict visitation policies, even for terminally ill patients, sparking criticism from doctors and social workers. These restrictions, including mask mandates, temperature checks, time limits, and visitor number limits, are seen as human rights violations. While the health ministry recommends balancing visitation with infection control, the decision-making is left to individual facilities. Some hospitals have no restrictions, and data suggests visitation limits are not scientifically proven to prevent infection spread; critics argue the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, particularly for those in their final days.</p>

          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who dwell on work-related problems may pass anxiety to their pets. Researchers found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is linked to 'work-related rumination,' where owners mentally bring work home, potentially affecting their interactions with their dogs and disrupting routines. The article emphasizes the importance of employed dog owners avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect the well-being of their canine companions.</p>

The Dodgers' pitcher, Tony Gonsolin, struggled with command, issuing consecutive walks that loaded the bases before Soto's hit, which highlighted the team's reliance on their starting pitchers due to an overworked bullpen. Mets starter David Peterson delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 â…” innings and limiting the Dodgers' offense.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions due to increasing competition for talent as Japanese cuisine becomes more popular worldwide. The new scheme, starting in January, will offer annual salaries of over 6 million yen, up from the current 4 to 4.5 million yen. Chefs will also be allowed to opt for rented accommodation covered by the government, and the aim is to promote Japanese food more proactively, recognizing the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump threatened a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU, complaining that the bloc was "taking advantage of the United States on trade". The EU's trade chief responded with a defiant tone, stating that the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides but is ready to defend its interests. Amidst this trade tension, there's a surge in Americans seeking permanent British residency, driven by the polarized political climate under Trump, while federal officials visited Alcatraz to assess reopening the infamous prison following Trump's announcement of plans to rebuild it.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man to the U.S. after he was wrongfully deported to Mexico despite fears of harm. The man, who is gay, had been protected from deportation to Guatemala by a U.S. immigration judge's order, but was instead sent to Mexico, a decision the judge deemed lacked due process. The ruling highlights a series of findings against Trump administration deportations, and the judge emphasized that facilitating the man's return should not be complicated.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the service now under public ownership. The government hails the move as a "new dawn for rail" but stops short of promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and reinvesting profits in infrastructure. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives urge Labour to deliver on its promises. The nationalized service will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, with the first service bearing the new GBR livery.</p>

The restrictions, which include the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are justified as necessary to protect national security. The Pentagon Press Association has criticized the move as an attack on freedom of the press, and the National Press Club is urging a reversal of the decision, arguing that restricting access undermines public trust.</p>

The announcement follows pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to address cuts to winter fuel payments and calls for the removal of the two-child benefit cap, a policy introduced in 2017 that restricts benefits for families with more than two children.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual assault," which redefined the understanding of sexual assault as a crime of power rather than passion, has died at 90.

While celebrated for her contributions, Brownmiller also faced criticism for some of her views, including her stance on pornography and her later comments on women's responsibility in avoiding sexual assault.</p>
