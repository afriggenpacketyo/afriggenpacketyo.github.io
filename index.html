        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has escalated his unsubstantiated accusations that Joe Biden's aides illicitly used an autopen to enact policies without Biden's full awareness. Trump insists he can discern which executive orders were signed with the device, alleging its use facilitated radical policies on open borders and transgender rights that Biden supposedly didn't endorse. Biden has refuted these claims, with the Justice Department's legal counsel affirming the legality of autopens for signing bills. Republican Senators are set to hold a hearing on Biden's mental state while in office, and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has subpoenaed Biden's physician for a deposition as part of an investigation into the alleged cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline. The article also mentions Trump's remarks about the human mind during a debate. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws in the United States apply equally to all employees, regardless of their race, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic. The justices rejected the notion that members of a majority group must present more evidence of discrimination to win a lawsuit. The ruling revives a lawsuit by an Ohio woman who claimed she was demoted and discriminated against by her lesbian supervisor. Experts suggest the decision will streamline litigation processes and eliminate the need for additional proof from majority groups in certain regions. </p>

The SNAP cuts total an estimated $230 billion over 10 years.
