            <p>A Siemens executive, Agustin Escobar, his wife, and their three young children were among six killed when a tourist helicopter crashed into the Hudson River in New York City. The helicopter, operated by New York Helicopters, went down shortly after departing from the Wall St. Heliport. The family was visiting from Barcelona, Spain, and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash. New York City Mayor Eric Adams expressed condolences to the family and those on board, noting the tragedy of visitors losing their lives while seeing the city's skyline.</p>

            <p>Argentina experienced significant transport disruptions due to a general strike protesting public spending cuts implemented by President Javier Milei. Domestic flights were canceled, and train and metro services were suspended in Buenos Aires. While international flights proceeded with minimal delays, many shops remained closed. The strike, the third since Milei took office, highlights the unions' concerns about the impact of austerity measures on vulnerable populations, including pensioners and low-paid workers.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court directed a lower court to clarify its order, questioning whether the administration can be compelled to bring Abrego Garcia back. While acknowledging the Executive Branch's role in foreign affairs, the decision rebukes the administration's deportation policies. Abrego Garcia's lawyer hailed the decision as a victory for the rule of law, emphasizing the need to bring him home.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were terminated after the Supreme Court struck down a lower court decision protecting their jobs. The probationary employees, previously dismissed and rehired, were fired again following the ruling that nonprofit groups lacked legal standing to sue on their behalf. These firings are expected to hamper the agency's ability to provide essential climate and weather intelligence, impacting both the American public and global scientific communities. The terminations coincide with the White House pulling funding for the national climate assessment, raising concerns about the future of climate science.</p>

While charges were dismissed due to lack of probable cause for kidnapping and conspiracy, one student still faces assault charges, and another faces a witness intimidation charge.

The author suggests that the Chinese Communist Party must be confronted, and Trump is the right leader to do so. The piece reflects a protectionist viewpoint, emphasizing the need to address trade imbalances and unfair practices.</p>

In mid-March, Trump’s government deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where he is currently detained in a notorious prison supposedly reserved for terrorists. The administration claims that Abrego Garcia was deported as the result of an “administrative error.” The Supreme Court concludes that the lower court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.</p>
