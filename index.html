          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement operations. President Trump signed a memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness in California, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move, calling it purposefully inflammatory and stating that it will only escalate tensions. The deployment marks a significant escalation in the response to the ongoing demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the state, raising concerns about federal overreach and state sovereignty. The situation remains tense as protesters continue to voice their opposition to federal immigration policies. Optimism for de-escalation is low.</p>

          <p>Britain's energy market is considering a radical shift to regional pricing to address rising energy bills and grid capacity issues. The current system pays energy firms to not provide power due to insufficient grid capacity, costing the country hundreds of millions. The proposed change aims to create smaller regional markets, potentially lowering bills in areas with abundant renewable energy sources like Scotland. However, the plan faces opposition from energy firms concerned about undermining contracts and increasing uncertainty, sparking intense debate and raising questions about the government's net-zero policy. The potential outcome of this policy shift is uncertain.</p>

          <p>During India's Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government considered reimagining the country as a centralized state with a presidential system. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, Gandhi's aides proposed a directly elected president with curtailed parliamentary and judicial powers. The idea, though never fully realized, influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and centralized executive authority. This period marked a significant shift towards authoritarianism, raising questions about the fragility of democratic institutions. This time in history is a reminder of the importance of safeguarding civil liberties.</p>
