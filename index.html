          <p>Three House Democrats have formally requested detailed information from the Trump administration regarding the construction of a new, privately funded ballroom in the White House East Wing. Citing concerns over a lack of transparency and the project's ballooning costs, which have reportedly risen to $300 million, the lawmakers are seeking architectural plans, a budget, a list of donors, and legal justifications. The request follows the start of demolition work on the East Wing to accommodate the 90,000-square-foot structure. President Trump has defended the project's transparency, while critics argue the decisions were made secretly without proper consultation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the large-scale "No Kings" protests against President Trump, political discourse has shifted to the challenge of converting street mobilization into tangible political change. In an interview, Harvard professor Theda Skocpol argues that the success of such movements depends not on protest size alone, but on sustained, local-level organizing that feeds into electoral results, similar to the Tea Party in 2010 and the anti-Trump resistance in 2018. She emphasizes the need for a broad-tent, "militant inclusion" approach focused on winning elections rather than ideological purity. The article explores the debate on whether decentralized, opposition-focused protests can effectively challenge an administration prepared to withstand them.</p>

          <p>Shares in French luxury group Kering saw a significant jump of over 9% after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales, signaling a potential turnaround. While overall sales declined by 5%, this marked a sharp improvement from the 15% drop in the previous quarter, largely driven by its flagship brand, Gucci. Sales at Gucci fell 14%, but this was a notable recovery from the 25% plunge it experienced in the second quarter, boosting investor confidence. The positive results, alongside a recent decision to sell its beauty unit, suggest that CEO Luca de Meo's strategy to refocus on core fashion businesses is beginning to yield results.

          <h2>California Governor Threatens Lawsuit Over Potential Federal Troop Deployment in San Francisco</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 05:46:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed to file an immediate lawsuit against the Trump administration if it attempts to deploy National Guard troops to San Francisco. This response follows President Trump's statement that San Francisco would be the next city to see federal intervention to address crime, a move local officials, including Mayor Daniel Lurie, oppose as unnecessary and ineffective. Newsom has condemned the potential deployment as an authoritarian overreach and an assault on state sovereignty, emphasizing that California will not "bow to kings." The confrontation highlights the ongoing tensions between state and federal authorities over the domestic use of military forces.</p>

          <p>The UK's largest water company, Thames Water, has been given a one-star rating for its poor environmental performance in 2024 by the Environment Agency, primarily due to repeated sewage spills. The agency's annual assessment revealed a systemic issue, with eight of England's nine water companies rated as "requiring improvement" or worse, marking the industry's worst combined score since 2011. This decline in performance, attributed to underinvestment and wet weather, has fueled public anger over rising bills and pollution. Campaigners are calling for a complete overhaul of the privatized water system to protect rivers and ensure accountability.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is slowly moving through the Caribbean Sea and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane by early next week, bringing a significant flood risk to several island nations. Due to its slow crawl, the storm is expected to dump 5 to 10 inches of rain or more on parts of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Cuba, likely triggering life-threatening flash floods and landslides. A hurricane watch is in effect for southwestern Haiti, while Jamaica is under a tropical storm watch. While the threat to the mainland U.S. remains low, the storm's development is being closely monitored as it strengthens over warm Caribbean waters.</p>

          <p>The third and final T20 cricket match between England and New Zealand in Auckland was abandoned due to persistent rain, resulting in a 1-0 series victory for England. Only 3.4 overs of play were possible before the weather forced the match to be called off, with New Zealand at 38-1. The result marks the first overseas series win for Harry Brook as England's white-ball captain, continuing an encouraging start to his leadership. The weather-disrupted series provided limited preparation for both teams ahead of the T20 World Cup, with England now turning its focus to an upcoming ODI series against the Black Caps.</p>

The policy reflects a growing belief in Washington that the government should benefit from the success of companies it helps fund, particularly in industries vital for economic and technological competition with China.

This marks the stock's best-ever trading day since its public listing four years ago, providing a major boost to the automaker owned by China's Geely Holding.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, in a significant policy shift aimed at pressuring Moscow to end the war in Ukraine.

The sanctions are intended to materially impact Russia's ability to finance the war and coerce it into accepting peace terms.

          <p>A new German-language film, "The Disappearance of Josef Mengele," delves into the decades-long evasion of justice by the infamous Nazi physician. Directed by Kirill Serebrennikov and based on a non-fiction book, the movie portrays Mengele's life on the run in South America after escaping Germany post-World War II. The film explores the psychology of the "Angel of Death," who performed sadistic experiments at Auschwitz, and examines the network of sympathizers who helped him hide. By focusing on his lonely and paranoid final years, the film serves as a bleak portrait of unpunished evil and a cautionary tale about the dangers of ideological extremism.</p>

This article traces the history from 19th-century players using a so-called "monkey testicle elixir" to the amphetamine era, the cocaine scandals of the 1980s, and the steroid boom. It argues that the sport's culture, which prizes endurance and daily availability above all, has consistently created an environment where players turn to chemical aids to manage pain and prolong careers. Skaggs's death from a fentanyl-laced pill is presented not as an anomaly but as a tragic outcome of a system that has long normalized substance use to survive the grueling demands of the game.</p>

          <p>Starbucks Workers United, the union representing over 12,000 baristas at more than 650 stores, is initiating a strike authorization vote as it seeks to pressure the company into securing a labor contract. Negotiations between the two sides broke down in late 2024, and the union is now demanding better staffing hours, higher take-home pay, and a resolution for outstanding unfair labor practice charges. Alongside the vote, the union is planning a wave of rallies and pickets in 60 cities across the country. Starbucks maintains that it is ready to resume talks and that it already offers industry-leading pay and benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professional sports teams are increasingly adopting business strategies that are making it more expensive for average fans to attend games. Teams are focusing on selling fewer, higher-priced tickets, utilizing dynamic pricing to adjust costs based on demand, and creating more premium seating and exclusive club areas. This trend is exemplified by the Baltimore Orioles, whose new season ticket packages have led to price hikes of 35% or more for some long-time fans, forcing many to give up their seats. Sports economists explain that this shift reflects a deliberate strategy to maximize revenue per attendee rather than maximizing total attendance.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner has returned to a prominent diplomatic role, assisting the Trump administration in securing and implementing the Gaza ceasefire, which has raised ethical concerns due to his extensive business interests in the region. After leaving the White House, Kushner's investment firm received billions from foreign governments he had engaged with while brokering the Abraham Accords. Critics question the potential for conflicts of interest, while supporters, including the White House, argue that his deep relationships and experience are assets that were critical to achieving the peace deal. Kushner himself contends that what others call conflicts are actually trusted relationships essential for effective diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to cities like Portland and Chicago is facing critical tests in federal courts, including an appeal to the Supreme Court. The cases center on whether the president can unilaterally declare a need for military intervention against the wishes of state and local leaders. While a circuit court panel sided with the administration regarding Portland, another upheld a block on deployments in Chicago. These conflicting rulings have created a complex legal landscape, and upcoming decisions could set important precedents regarding the limits of presidential power to use the military for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new analysis of over 150 clinical trials has systematically compared the physical side effects of 30 different antidepressants, offering a valuable resource for clinicians and patients. The U.K. study, published in The Lancet, quantifies the average impact of each medication on weight, heart rate, cholesterol, and blood pressure. The findings show that commonly prescribed SSRIs like Zoloft and Prozac tend to have fewer physical side effects than some older drugs. Researchers have created a digital tool to help tailor medication choices to an individual's health profile and concerns, aiming to facilitate more personalized treatment decisions.</p>

          <p>A persistent shortage of smaller, more affordable "starter homes" is preventing many first-time buyers from entering the housing market, even as bidding wars cool. For decades, the construction of such homes has declined, dropping from 40% of the market in the 1980s to just 12% in 2023 due to rising material costs and restrictive zoning laws. Additionally, many current owners of starter homes are unwilling to sell and give up their low mortgage rates, reducing available inventory. Experts advise prospective buyers to be flexible, consider homes further from city centers, and work with financial institutions to prepare for when market conditions improve.</p>

After stating that his talks with Putin "don't go anywhere," Trump canceled a planned summit, a move largely ignored by pro-Kremlin state media. This abrupt shift in tone comes just days after a seemingly productive phone call between the two leaders. The sanctions, targeting Lukoil and Rosneft, are aimed at pressuring Russia over the war in Ukraine, leaving Moscow to navigate a suddenly more adversarial stance from the U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>Despite a prolonged and deepening slump in China's property sector, analysts believe Beijing is unlikely to implement a major bailout, instead prioritizing technological development as a more urgent national goal. Real estate investment fell nearly 14% in the first three quarters of the year, yet official rhetoric emphasizes achievements in high-tech manufacturing and mitigating financial risks. This suggests a strategic pivot where policymakers accept the drag from real estate as manageable while focusing resources on winning the tech race amid geopolitical tensions. With falling home prices and weak buyer sentiment, the property market is not expected to bottom out soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, France is backing away from its commitment to more aggressively intercept small boats carrying migrants across the English Channel. A promised new "maritime doctrine," which would involve turning boats back to shore, is reportedly stalled due to France's current political turmoil as well as legal and safety concerns within its maritime security forces. The hesitation is a setback for the UK government's efforts to stop the crossings. Meanwhile, dangerously overcrowded inflatable boats continue to depart from the French coast, with French authorities often limited to observing them due to rules that restrict intervention unless lives are in imminent danger.</p>
