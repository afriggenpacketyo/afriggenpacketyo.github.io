          <p>The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index has fallen to its lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic, signaling growing pessimism about the economy. The Expectations Index, reflecting the outlook for the next six months, is at its lowest point since 2011, with respondents anticipating a decline in employment and future income prospects. Fears over tariffs are driving this pessimism, reaching an all-time high in the survey, with recession expectations also increasing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a drop in employment postings, further contributing to the downbeat economic sentiment.</p>

          <p>Amazon has clarified that it will not display tariff costs on its website after the White House criticized the reported plan as a "hostile and political act." The company stated that it had considered listing import charges on items sold via its ultra-discount Amazon Haul store, but the idea was never approved. This consideration arose in response to Trump's removal of the de minimis trade loophole. The White House had questioned why Amazon didn't implement similar measures during the Biden administration when inflation was high, leading to Amazon reaffirming its commitment to working with the Trump administration.</p>

Despite US strikes, the Houthis have managed to fend off several US drones and maintain their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Analysts suggest the Houthis are receiving diversified arms supplies from Iran and China, enabling them to adapt their air defense and drone capabilities. The US maintains its commitment to restoring freedom of navigation in the region, but the civilian population is bearing the brunt of the conflict.</p>

The reimbursements on auto parts tariffs include up to an amount equal to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year, followed by 2.5% of the car's value in a second year, and then would be phased out altogether.</p>

          <p>Trump's first 100 days in office have unleashed chaos with tariffs and executive orders, tanking markets and global trust. Trump's policies have created great uncertainty among US businesses and consumers, struggling to calculate the impact of unprecedented tariffs on imported goods. The worst impacted are buyers of China-made products, which now face a whopping 145% tariff. There are rising concerns about a potential recession gripping the US and global economies.</p>

The prior guidance can't be relied upon, and we'll come back to the market with clarity as soon as we have it.</p>

Critics of the attendance ban welcomed Ms. Burns’ presence, but insisted it was not enough. They said that the Trump administration had already shown a lack of understanding about the importance of postwar reconciliation with a country that is now a strategic partner in efforts to counter China’s influence across the region.</p>

However, despite sweeping sanctions designed to curb Moscow's energy revenue, Russia still accounted for roughly 19% of the EU's gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply in 2024.</p>
