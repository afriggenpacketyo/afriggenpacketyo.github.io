          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed optimism about ongoing negotiations over Ukraine, stating that both Moscow and Kyiv would need to compromise. He emphasized that Russia would not take the whole country, and Ukraine would not push them back to pre-2014 borders. Vice President Vance stated that the U.S. has put together a fair proposal and is awaiting a response from both Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. may walk away from the process if they do not agree.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is approaching $95,000, rising for a third consecutive day and turning positive for the year, boosted by a broad relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and the Federal Reserve. Exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin saw a spike in inflows, strengthening the cryptocurrency's appeal as a hedge. The rally has forced short sellers to cover their positions, further driving up the price. Analysts suggest that $100,000 remains a key psychological level.</p>

          <p>International tourism to the United States is slumping, while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas. Foreign visitors to the U.S. by air fell nearly 10% in March, while U.S. citizens flying abroad increased 1.6%. This imbalance could widen the gap between U.S. travel revenue and American spending abroad. Factors contributing to the decline include trade tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar. JPMorgan suggests the decline in foreign travel spending could negatively impact the gross domestic product.</p>
