          <p>Serious disorder broke out in Ballymena, County Antrim, for the second consecutive night, with fireworks, petrol bombs, and other projectiles thrown at police. The unrest, described by police as racially motivated, followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Riot officers responded with baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse the crowds, who set cars on fire and smashed windows of houses, some displaying signs indicating the nationalities of the residents. Politicians have condemned the violence, with some raising concerns about tensions due to the oversubscription of migrants in the area. The violence has raised concerns about community relations and the potential for further unrest, prompting calls for reflection and de-escalation. The community is now grappling with the aftermath of the violence and addressing underlying tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 15,000 protesters gathered in Budapest to demonstrate against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, criticizing his increasingly authoritarian policies. Speakers at the rally, including writers, actors, and journalists, condemned government corruption and the suppression of independent media. The protest was sparked by a law effectively banning public LGBTQ+ events and allowing authorities to use facial recognition to identify participants in prohibited assemblies. Critics argue that Orbán is silencing opposition and consolidating power as national elections approach, citing a draft bill that would allow the government to blacklist critical media organizations and NGOs. The demonstrators express hope that public support for Orbán is waning, potentially leading to a change in government in the upcoming elections.</p>

Beijing has leveraged its dominance in critical mineral production as a negotiating point in trade disputes, targeting the defense industries of the U.S. and its allies.

          <p>The UK's Spending Review has outlined increased spending for Scotland in areas such as defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. Chancellor Rachel Reeves allocated £250m for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, £750m for a supercomputer in Edinburgh, and funding for the Acorn Project in St Fergus. The review balances competing priorities, scrutinizing spending lines and setting new priorities, while also accounting for existing commitments. The changes in day-to-day spending and capital projects will affect Holyrood's budget through a formula that applies a share of the change to the block grant passed from the Treasury to Holyrood.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a significant defeat against the San Diego Padres, losing 11-1 in a game where they appeared to concede early on. The Dodgers used a minor league call-up as their starting pitcher, who struggled significantly, and later employed a position player to pitch multiple innings. This decision reflected the team's limited pitching resources due to injuries and a taxed bullpen. The Dodgers' focus shifted to the next game in the series, with key players being removed early in the face of a large deficit.</p>
