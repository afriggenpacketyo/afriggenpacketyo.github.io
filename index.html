          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited Syria to engage with the new interim government that replaced the Assad regime. He urged the new leaders, many of whom have ties to the formerly proscribed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, to ensure transparency, accountability, and inclusivity for all Syrian communities. The visit comes as Western nations, including the US and UK, have lifted sanctions to reset relations. Lammy emphasized that the UK is looking "to the future" while monitoring the fragile security situation and concerns about minority rights and restrictions on social freedoms.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 32 deaths, including 14 children, with over two dozen people still missing from a children's summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose unexpectedly fast, surging 26 feet in 45 minutes, overwhelming the area and leading to a mass casualty event. Rescue operations are ongoing, with hundreds of people saved, some found clinging to trees. Officials, including the Texas governor, are coordinating a massive response, but noted the community was caught off guard by the flood's unprecedented severity.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the creation of a new political party called the "America Party," following a poll he conducted on his social media platform, X. He suggested the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. The move follows a public falling out with former President Donald Trump and Musk's vocal opposition to a recent five-trillion-dollar spending bill. Musk, a major political donor, stated the new party would caucus independently and aim to represent the "true will of the people."</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, indicating readiness for further negotiations on implementation details. The proposed 60-day deal involves the release of 10 living hostages and the remains of 15 others in exchange for a pause in the nearly 21-month conflict. However, Israel's Prime Minister's office called Hamas's requested changes "unacceptable" but agreed to send a negotiating team to continue talks. The war has resulted in nearly 56,000 deaths in Gaza, following the initial Hamas-led attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point after one of its trustees delivered an "inflammatory and divisive" sermon shortly after the October 7 Hamas attacks.

The trustee, Harun Abdur Rashid Holmes, has been disqualified from holding a senior charity position for three years. The commission stated that while the content referenced a historical narration, it lacked appropriate context and was delivered at a highly sensitive time, stoking division rather than furthering charitable purposes.</p>

The experience of once again piloting a ship was a dreamlike moment for him, confirming that his time on the river was a cherished period of freedom.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 29 people in Parliament Square on suspicion of offenses under the Terrorism Act. The arrests occurred during a protest where individuals held placards expressing support for Palestine Action, a group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the same day. This designation makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or show support for the group, carrying a potential prison sentence of up to 14 years. The government moved to ban the group following significant criminal damage caused during its protests, particularly at an RAF base.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County has expanded to nearly 80,000 acres, making it the largest wildfire in California this year. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, has forced over 200 people to evacuate and threatens about 50 structures. Fueled by heat and wind, the fire is primarily impacting the Carrizo Plain National Monument, a habitat for endangered species. With over 600 personnel and multiple air tankers battling the fire, officials are concerned that an incoming heat wave will escalate the fire risk across Southern California.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Roubaix, France, titled "The Statue of Liberty's Silent Protest," has gone viral for its powerful commentary on recent U.S. immigration policies. The painting by Dutch artist Judith de Leeuw depicts Lady Liberty covering her face in her hands, a symbol of shame and lost values. The location was chosen for its large migrant population, and the timing of its unveiling around July 4th was noted as a "meaningful coincidence," as France gifted the original statue to the U.S. The artwork has sparked widespread online discussion, with many praising it as an accurate reflection of global sentiment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has faced criticism from Jewish organizations after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" to describe some bankers during a rally in Iowa. The term originates from a ruthless Jewish moneylender in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware the term was considered offensive. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the slur "very troubling and irresponsible," stating that it evokes centuries-old stereotypes about Jews and greed, while critics accused him of knowingly using blatant and vile antisemitism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry to ChatGPT about taxing billionaires at the same rate as the middle class revealed key nuances in the U.S. tax system. The AI explained that the core issue is not the nominal tax rate but how different income types are treated, noting the system "taxes work more than wealth." While the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of around 16%, they benefit from strategies unavailable to wage earners. The AI highlighted the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where billionaires borrow against their untaxed asset growth and pass wealth to heirs largely tax-free, a significant advantage over salaried workers.

          <p>The arrest of boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. by U.S. authorities has sent ripples of unease through his hometown of Culiacan, Mexico, the heartland of the Sinaloa Cartel. While detained for visa issues, U.S. officials also highlighted an active Mexican warrant for him on trafficking charges and alleged ties to the cartel. In Culiacan, where his legendary father is an idol, the news is discussed in hushed tones amid a recent, bloody internal feud within the cartel that has made residents wary of speaking openly.

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing backlash for sending an email that critics call "blatant misinformation" about President Trump's new spending bill. The email claimed the bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." In reality, the legislation provides a temporary tax deduction that phases out for higher incomes, rather than eliminating the tax. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the communication as a partisan and unconscionable political statement from a traditionally apolitical agency, with one congressman calling every word of it a "lie."

          <p>A focus group of 2024 Labour voters from Kent, organized by the BBC, revealed a prevailing sense of disappointment with the party's first year in government. Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, particularly regarding immigration, and felt the government had not been entirely straightforward about its plans. While some were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of turning the country around in a year, others felt "lied to." The government's recent U-turns were seen as worrying, and the rising popularity of the Reform UK party was noted as a potential alternative for disillusioned voters.</p>
