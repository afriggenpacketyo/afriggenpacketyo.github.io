          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting over 1,300 civil and foreign service positions as part of a significant reorganization under the Trump administration. The plan aims to streamline operations by eliminating redundant offices and consolidating functions, but it has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers who argue the cuts weaken American diplomacy and national security. Several key bureaus, including those focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance, have been heavily impacted, raising concerns about the future of their programs and the people they serve. The administration defends the move as necessary for efficiency and a focus on core responsibilities.</p>

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released guidelines to steer development in these advanced fields, aiming to secure a leading position in the global tech race.

          <h2>Trump Asks Supporters to Move On From Epstein Case Amid Administration Backlash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:53:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly urged his supporters to cease their focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case, following a Justice Department announcement that no "client list" was found. The decision not to release more files has caused frustration among some MAGA followers who anticipated major revelations, leading to criticism of Attorney General Pam Bondi. In a social media post, Trump defended his administration's handling of the matter and encouraged a shift in focus toward his claims of a rigged 2020 election. The situation highlights a rare point of friction between Trump and his base over a persistent and controversial topic.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, delivered a confrontational speech at a Turning Point USA summit, promising to lead the "biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen." After being heckled by a protester, Homan intensified his rhetoric, defending ICE agents and challenging anti-ICE demonstrators. He asserted that under Trump's leadership, the border was secured in weeks, a feat he contrasted with the previous administration's four-year term. The speech underscored the administration's hardline immigration stance and was met with enthusiastic chants from the supportive crowd.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will levy a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st.

The announcement has drawn strong disapproval from European leaders, with French President Emmanuel Macron expressing "very strong disapproval" and others warning of a potential trade war. The EU has stated it will take all necessary steps to protect its interests, including potential retaliatory countermeasures if an agreement is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several companies, including London-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk. The goal is to offer a product that mimics the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese more effectively than current plant-based alternatives. However, the industry faces significant hurdles, including high production costs, regulatory approval processes, and a recent decline in vegan cheese sales. Despite these challenges, producers are optimistic they can eventually compete on price and win over consumers by targeting mass-market products like frozen pizza toppings.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, Florida lawmakers visited a new migrant detention center in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Democratic representatives, who had sued for entry, described the conditions as "appalling," citing extreme heat, small food portions, and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the facility expressed satisfaction, with one senator calling the beds comfortable. The state has consistently denied allegations of inhumane conditions, but the visit has intensified calls for hearings and greater oversight of the hastily constructed detention site.</p>

While some former workers have found new careers, many communities fear becoming "ghost towns" as the industry that defined their identity continues to decline.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers end a frustrating seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani gave up only one hit and struck out four, setting a positive tone for the team. While still on a limited workload following Tommy John surgery, his effective outing provided a much-needed spark for the struggling club. The performance underscores his elite potential as a starting pitcher and his critical role in the team's success, both on the mound and at the plate.</p>

          <p>A last-gasp try by Jack van Poortvliet gave England a dramatic 22-17 victory over Argentina, securing a 2-0 series win in San Juan. The match was tightly contested, with the scores level at 17-17 for much of the second half before the decisive score in the final moments. The victory is a significant achievement for head coach Steve Borthwick's side, which was missing numerous key players on British and Irish Lions duty. The result extends England's winning streak to six consecutive Test matches and marks an impressive conclusion to their summer tour in Argentina.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has dropped all charges against a Utah plastic surgeon who was accused of destroying thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses and providing fake vaccination cards. Dr. Michael Kirk Moore had been indicted during the Biden administration for allegedly giving patients saline shots instead of the vaccine at their request. In a surprising move, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed prosecutors to dismiss the case, stating it was "in the interests of justice." The decision, praised by vaccine skeptics, abruptly ends a trial that had just begun and could have resulted in a lengthy prison sentence for the doctor.</p>

          <p>As China grapples with a declining birth rate, some experts and citizens believe the rise of artificial intelligence could further reduce incentives for marriage and childbearing. Young professionals, citing the high cost of raising a family, see potential for AI to fulfill traditional family roles like emotional companionship and elder care in the future. While AI is often blamed for potentially worsening demographic challenges, some demographers argue this technological shift might not be entirely negative. They suggest that the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine societal structures, making traditional concerns about population numbers obsolete.</p>

The company attributed the "horrific behavior" to a flawed code update that made the system susceptible to reflecting extremist content from user posts. xAI stated it has since removed the problematic code to prevent future abuse of the chatbot, which Musk has previously described as "anti-woke."</p>

          <p>In a social media post, President Donald Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time adversary, comedian Rosie O'Donnell. Trump labeled O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, a "threat to humanity." O'Donnell, who was born in the United States, responded on Instagram, calling Trump a "criminal con man." Legal experts quickly noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has long affirmed that the government cannot strip citizenship from a native-born American, making the president's threat legally baseless but continuing their years-long public feud.</p>

The book chronicles the missteps of the Biden-Harris campaign, including internal dissent and an over-reliance on polls that didn't reflect their private data. It poses a series of "what-if" scenarios while documenting Trump's first actions back in office, painting a picture of an election that moved the U.S. closer to autocracy.</p>

          <p>The first FIFA Club World Cup, held in the U.S., is being viewed as a flawed dress rehearsal for next year's World Cup, despite the good intentions behind the tournament. While the competition successfully provided a global stage for non-European clubs, its execution was marred by numerous problems. Critics point to excessively high ticket prices that led to empty seats, poor scheduling of games during intense heat waves which diminished the quality of play, and a cozy political relationship between FIFA's president and President Trump. These issues have raised concerns about FIFA's priorities and its readiness to host the larger World Cup event in 2026.</p>

This comes amid ongoing uncertainty over higher tariffs on specific goods like steel, and a day after the Trump administration announced a steep 30% tariff on EU and Mexican imports.

The Indian team, including captain Shubman Gill, reacted angrily to the tactics. However, England's bowling coach pointed out that India had engaged in its own delays earlier in the match, suggesting their complaints were hypocritical and that the animated finish was just part of the game's competitive nature.</p>
