            <p>In his annual shareholder letter, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy predicted that AI costs will decrease due to rapid advancements and increased competition in the chip market, despite Amazon's significant AI-related capital expenditures, which could reach $100 billion this year. Jassy emphasized that AI does not have to remain as expensive as it currently is. He also highlighted Amazon's strong 2024 financial results, including revenue growth and improved operating income, as well as the company's focus on customer-centric innovation across its various business segments. Jassy attributed Amazon's success to a 'Why' culture that constantly questions and challenges existing norms to improve customer experiences.</p>

            <p>Lulu Gribbin, an Alabama teen who survived a shark attack in 2024, is urging lawmakers to establish a shark attack alert system similar to Amber Alerts. Gribbin, who lost her left hand and part of her leg in the attack, believes an alert could have prevented her and her friend from entering the water that day. The proposed system would notify the public of unprovoked shark attacks in the area. While shark attacks are rare, Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark research program, noted that weather conditions that day likely brought an abundance of small fish closer to shore.</p>

            <p>President Trump's 90-day pause on some tariffs provided temporary relief to investors, but it did not address the underlying economic uncertainty created by his volatile trade policies. While the pause allowed businesses time to adjust, the tariffs, even at current levels, continue to disrupt the global trade order. Experts argue that the uncertainty generated by Trump's abrupt policy changes makes businesses hesitant to invest in the US market. This economic uncertainty, coupled with Trump's perceived lack of understanding of economics, undermines confidence in the US economy.</p>

China's Foreign Ministry took a harsher stance, vowing to fight to the end if the U.S. insists on escalating the trade war. Meanwhile, the EU announced a similar 90-day pause on retaliatory tariffs, hoping to allow negotiations a chance.</p>

The judge dismissed the appeal, stating that the previous judge was entitled to reach the conclusion he came to. The case stemmed from Rooney's accusation that Vardy's Instagram account leaked private information about her to the press.</p>

The BFI said this version of the film is rarely publicly screened since George Lucas' produced special editions were released in the 1990s, altering some plot points and adding other CGI characters. Today, only the updated versions are available on official streaming platforms and Blu-ray, making screenings of the film's original cut rare.</p>

            <p>Global commodity prices are experiencing a significant decline, with the S&P GSCI Commodities index falling more than 20% from the same period last year. This sell-off is attributed to escalating trade war tensions and growing recession signals. China's status as the largest consumer of commodities means that Trump's tariff policy is having a significant impact on the country's growth and consumption of certain commodities. Experts view the collapse in commodity prices as a warning sign of a potential global recession.</p>

The tariffs include additional duties of 24% on Japan and 25% on South Korea. On Wednesday the president raised his tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%.</p>

            <p>Weeks after the deadly Eaton fire, Southern California Edison quietly changed its internal policy on grounding idle transmission towers, but the details of these changes remain shrouded in mystery. Both Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) have declined to disclose the changes, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. The focus of the investigation has shifted to an idle transmission tower that had been unused for over five decades, with questions arising about whether it was properly grounded. The secrecy surrounding the policy changes has drawn criticism from attorneys and former officials, who argue that the documents should be made public.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles importers are grappling with uncertainty and rising prices as President Trump's tariffs take effect. Retailers selling toys, apparel, and homewares face the dilemma of absorbing added costs or passing them on to customers. Business owners worry about lower profits and the potential for teetering businesses, especially those specializing in nonessential products. While a 90-day postponement offers some relief, the looming taxes are poised to raise prices sharply when they do take effect.  These tariffs are already affecting grocery stores, such as Diamond Fresh Farmers Market, where much of the produce and groceries comes from foreign countries.</p>

            <p>Scientists have successfully re-created a pain pathway in the brain by growing key clusters of human nerve cells in a dish. This laboratory model could help explain certain pain syndromes and provide a new platform for testing potential analgesic drugs. The model, known as a brain assembloid, mimics the signaling chain that occurs after exposure to painful stimuli. Researchers tested the model with capsaicin, the chemical that makes chili peppers hot, and also created assembloids using cells with genetic variants linked to abnormal pain perception.</p>
