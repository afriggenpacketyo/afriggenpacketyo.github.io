          <p>A new comprehensive tax and spending bill will introduce significant changes, but many effects will not be immediate. Key provisions, such as new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and alterations to the Affordable Care Act, are scheduled to take effect in 2026, after the next elections. The legislation is projected to reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion over a decade, potentially increasing the number of uninsured Americans by nearly 12 million. Other changes, including adjustments to food assistance programs and tax deductions for tips and overtime, will be implemented sooner, impacting millions of households and various sectors of the economy.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has secured a permit to operate natural gas-burning turbines for its supercomputer facility in Memphis, Tennessee. The decision by the Shelby County Health Department came despite months of public opposition from local residents concerned about air quality and emissions of pollutants like nitrogen oxides. The permit includes emissions limits and testing requirements, with potential fines for non-compliance. The facility, which powers the Grok chatbot, is central to xAI's strategy to compete with other major AI systems, and the company states it will use state-of-the-art emissions control technology.</p>

          <h2>Pixar's 'Elio' Reportedly Underwent Changes to Remove LGBTQ+ Elements After Test Screenings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 18:04:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated Pixar film "Elio" allegedly had significant LGBTQ+ representation removed following negative feedback from test audiences and internal executive reviews. According to reports, the original director, Adrian Molina, left the project after his vision was altered, which included cutting a scene with a male crush for the main character and making the character more "masculine." The changes reportedly led to an exodus of talent from the production team. The film, which ultimately underperformed at the box office, is now viewed by some former staffers as a compromised version of the original, more personal story Molina intended to create.</p>

          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has recommended that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds to swap out the hidden debts of local governments. Researchers from Tsinghua University argue this measure is crucial for mitigating financial risks and revitalizing the nation's economic growth, which is hampered by high local debt levels. The proposal suggests that this comprehensive fiscal package, which could also include funds to support the property market and boost consumption, would provide a definitive solution to the country's pressing economic challenges. The report highlights that unidentified local-level debt remains a significant threat to financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has put 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a public letter criticizing the Trump administration's environmental policies. The "Declaration of Dissent," signed by over 600 current and former employees, accused the administration of promoting deregulation and disregarding scientific expertise, thereby undermining the agency's mission. An EPA spokesperson stated the agency has a "zero-tolerance policy" for what it termed "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda. The employees have been placed on paid leave for two weeks pending an investigation, a move that highlights growing tensions between career government staff and political leadership.</p>

Scientists are now monitoring the object to determine its size and composition as it makes its closest approach to the sun in late October.

          <p>New anti-obesity medications like GLP-1s are transformative but often unaffordable, with U.S. prices far exceeding those in other countries. A proposed solution involves restructuring how these drugs are paid for through employer-sponsored health plans. The article suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, allowing employers to purchase the drugs at the direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month. If employers then contribute a portion of this cost, the employee's out-of-pocket expense could be significantly reduced, making these vital medications more accessible and improving public health by tackling cardiometabolic diseases.</p>

          <p>The United States labor market demonstrated continued resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and exceeding economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate also saw a slight decline, falling to 4.1%. Job growth was notably strong in the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the healthcare sector also posted solid gains. These figures suggest the job market remains on solid ground despite broader economic uncertainties, including concerns over trade policy. The robust report may lead the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates at its upcoming meeting, delaying anticipated cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Four Key Tax Breaks in New Republican Bill Are Set to Expire in 2028</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 16:31:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the newly passed Republican spending bill makes many 2017 tax cuts permanent, several of its new provisions are only temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. These include deductions for tips and overtime pay, which were key campaign promises, as well as a deduction for interest on new auto loans. The bill also introduces "Trump accounts," a new type of government-seeded savings vehicle for children born between 2025 and 2028. While these temporary measures offer short-term benefits to certain taxpayers, their expiration creates future uncertainty in the tax code. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A skydiving plane carrying 15 people crashed at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, resulting in injuries but miraculously no fatalities. Officials reported that three individuals are in critical condition after the Cessna aircraft experienced engine trouble shortly after takeoff. The pilot attempted an emergency landing but overran the runway into a wooded area. Emergency responders, who had recently conducted a mass casualty drill at the same airport, were praised for their effective response. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, noting the same plane was involved in a previous landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals startling details in the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew. The indictment alleges her remains, found in a shallow grave, were moved there after her body had already decomposed elsewhere. Furthermore, toxicological analysis of her bone marrow found a compound used to tranquilize wildlife, a substance Barry Morphew had access to and admitted to using on deer. These new findings led to his second arrest in the case, suggesting a premeditated crime where Suzanne was drugged before her death. Barry Morphew has consistently denied any involvement in his wife's 2020 disappearance and murder.</p>

          <p>A former security contractor for a U.S.-backed aid distribution program in Gaza has told the BBC he witnessed colleagues open fire on hungry Palestinian civilians without provocation. The anonymous source described a culture of impunity, claiming guards used machine guns on a crowd of women and children and that a team leader encouraged them to "shoot to kill." He also recounted an incident where contractors laughed after a Palestinian man was shot and fell motionless. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which runs the sites, has categorically denied the allegations, calling the source a "disgruntled former contractor" and insisting no civilians were ever fired upon.</p>

The 23-year-old expressed deep disappointment after the match, which marks another early exit for him at the All England Club. The loss is a significant blow to local hopes in the first Wimbledon of the post-Andy Murray era, as Draper's wait for a breakthrough performance at his home Grand Slam continues.</p>

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a speech lasting 8 hours and 44 minutes, setting a new record for the longest address on the House floor. He used the "magic minute" privilege, which allows party leaders to speak indefinitely, to vehemently protest the Republican's major tax and spending bill before its final vote. Jeffries called the legislation an "immoral document" and used the marathon speech to criticize its cuts to healthcare and food aid while providing a platform for Democratic opposition. The tactic delayed the bill's passage but did not change the ultimate outcome, as it passed the House later that day.</p>

          <p>Nissan is recalling more than 480,000 vehicles across the U.S. and Canada because of a manufacturing defect that could lead to sudden engine failure. The recall affects several popular models, including the Altima, Rogue, and Infiniti QX50, equipped with specific 1.5L and 2.0L turbo engines. According to the notice from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly manufactured engine bearings can fail, potentially causing the engine to lose power while driving. Dealers will inspect the engines for metal debris and perform necessary repairs or replacements free of charge, with owner notification letters being sent out in August.</p>
