          <h2>Singapore's July Inflation Rate Drops to 0.6%, Lowest Since January 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate for July eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest point since January 2021 and falling below June's 0.8%. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, primarily driven by decreases in retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs, with private transport prices rising. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates continued moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes, while domestically, slower wage growth should also contribute to moderation. This economic trend aligns with the MAS's projections for core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024, as the trade-dependent nation faces a global trade environment "downshift." The central bank has already eased monetary policy twice this year to cope with weaker growth, and the article highlights the country's economic path towards slower growth and inflation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, asserting it unconstitutionally impedes his power to appoint judges and U.S. Attorneys. He accused Democrats of using this custom to effectively veto his nominees, which has significantly slowed his judicial confirmations this term compared to his first. Trump specifically pressured Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon his defense of the century-old practice, urging him to allow strong Republican candidates to ascend to vital roles and to dismiss Democratic opposition forcefully. The article highlights Trump's frustration, noting it intensified after a U.S. District Judge ruled against his acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, underscoring the escalating political battle over the composition of the federal judiciary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A limited number of National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., have begun carrying service weapons following a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This marks an escalation in President Trump's intervention into D.C. policing, despite local officials asserting violent crime has been declining. The Joint Task Force stated that force would only be used as a last resort in response to imminent threats, but the move raises questions about the Guard's evolving role, as they were previously unarmed and primarily focused on crowd control and protecting landmarks. The article indicates that while the city was informed, the specific reasons for this new arming remain undisclosed by the Defense Department.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:14:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the "Great Resignation" of the pandemic era, labor markets in the U.S. and U.K. are now experiencing a "Great Stay," characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze from employers. This shift is attributed to economic insecurity, with workers staying put in stable positions, particularly in sectors like IT, and firms delaying hiring due to uncertainty about the future rather than a desire to reduce headcount. Despite slowing hiring momentum, as evidenced by slower U.S. nonfarm payroll growth and higher unemployment, initial jobless claims remain near historical lows. The U.K. is also observing a similar trend with falling job vacancies, as businesses await more economic confidence to drive recruitment and foster growth, as detailed in the article.</p>

          <p>Shares in China's state-backed Dongfeng Motor Group surged to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private in a deal valued at approximately $7 billion. The Wuhan-based company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This strategic move aligns with China's efforts to consolidate its automotive sector and enhance competitiveness, following a State Council statement earlier this year. Despite a 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries in the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models, particularly the VOYAH series, climbed significantly, as reported in the article.</p>

Deputy leader Richard Tice argues it is "grossly financially negligent" to leave potential hundreds of billions in shale gas underground. Despite previous bans due to concerns over earthquakes and environmental impact, and historical failures to establish commercial viability in the UK, the party plans to conduct independently monitored test wells to confirm gas quantity and safety within two years.

          <p>India fears China's planned mega-dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet could drastically reduce water flows to India by up to 85% during the dry season, impacting over 100 million people. This concern has prompted India to fast-track its own Upper Siang dam project, the country's largest, to mitigate potential water shortages and absorb any excess water released by China. Beijing, however, states its hydropower projects undergo rigorous scientific research and will not adversely affect downstream countries. The article highlights the escalating geopolitical tension over water resources between the two nuclear-armed rivals, with local Indian communities resisting the proposed dam due to fears of displacement.</p>
