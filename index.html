          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 13:11:10 EDT</div>

          <p>The FDA has named former biotech executive and Stanford professor George Tidmarsh as its new top drug regulator. He will lead the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), a crucial division responsible for reviewing new drug applications. This appointment comes amid significant changes at the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been skeptical of vaccines and pursued staff cuts. Tidmarsh's industry background is seen as a potential reassurance for pharmaceutical companies, though his past criticisms of certain regulatory decisions suggest he may adopt a more stringent approach.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to attract more customers as diners become more frugal due to economic pressures. The company reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, attributing the growth to successful promotions and new products like its stuffed crust pizza. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while the restaurant industry faces headwinds, Domino's can gain market share by offering compelling value, which has successfully drawn customers across all income levels. Despite this sales growth, the company's overall earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its China licensee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal funding. The administration is demanding changes to the university's policies on antisemitism and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, and has also moved to restrict foreign student visas. In a Boston courtroom, Harvard's lawyers argued the White House is unconstitutionally trying to control the university's internal operations and violating free speech. The government contends that federal funding is conditional on supporting its policies, with the judge questioning the administration's procedural basis for its actions.</p>

          <p>A violent attack in General Villamil Playas, an Ecuadorian tourist city, left at least nine people dead after armed assailants opened fire in a bar where patrons were playing pool. The incident is part of a larger wave of violence sweeping the nation, which has seen its homicide rate skyrocket due to the influence of drug trafficking organizations. Authorities are investigating the massacre, which occurred in the Guayas province, and noted that the death toll could rise as some victims were removed from the scene by family members before police arrived. The violence persists despite the recent recapture and extradition of notorious gang leader Adolfo "Fito" Macias.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average annual cost of college in the U.S. exceeding $38,000, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections and flexible requirements. However, these government-backed loans have strict annual and lifetime borrowing limits that vary based on dependency status, year in school, and whether the student is an undergraduate or graduate. For instance, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, which often falls short of total attendance costs. When federal loans are insufficient, students may turn to private loans, which can offer lower interest rates but typically require credit checks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to go public on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming a leading institutional investment vehicle for the cryptocurrency ether. Backed by a $645 million anchor investment, the firm plans to differentiate itself from other crypto treasury companies by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that supports the Ethereum network's operations. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues that this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as staking provides a dividend-like return that is not available through simply holding the coin or investing in current ETFs. The move comes as institutional interest in ether grows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, the Texas Legislature is meeting in a special session to potentially redraw the state's congressional district map, a move that could bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House. The current map, established after the 2020 Census, is already being challenged in court for allegedly diluting the power of non-White voters, who drove 95% of the state's recent population growth. The Justice Department has also alleged that four current districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Critics argue the mid-decade redistricting effort is a purely political maneuver to benefit the Trump administration ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

Studies show that this behavioral addiction can be as difficult to overcome as smoking, with apps and websites designed to be engaging and escapist. Scientists recommend a multi-faceted approach to reduce dependency, including creating physical distance from the device, turning off notifications, and setting the screen to black-and-white to make it less rewarding. For severe cases, therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States and pleaded not guilty to multiple charges in a Brooklyn court. The leader of the Los Choneros gang faces counts of international cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and weapons trafficking, which could result in a life sentence. His extradition is a major event, marking the first time an Ecuadorian citizen has been sent directly from Ecuador to the U.S. to face charges. Macias was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in 2024 that intensified a wave of gang-related violence across Ecuador.</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions between the White House and the Federal Reserve, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a broad review of the entire institution. Speaking on CNBC, Bessent suggested the examination should go beyond recent controversies, like building renovation costs, to assess whether the Fed has been successful in its overall mission. His comments follow a week of conflicting reports about whether President Trump intended to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent also supported the idea that the Fed should consider easing interest rates, criticizing the central bank for what he termed "fear mongering" over inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities are investigating the crash as a potential arson, and reports indicate the driver may have livestreamed the event. Pat Tillman was an NFL player who famously left his career to join the army after 9/11 and was killed in Afghanistan by friendly fire, a fact the Pentagon initially covered up.</p>
