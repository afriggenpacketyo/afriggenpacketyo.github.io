          <p>Rapper Tory Lanez, who is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion in 2020, was attacked at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi. Lanez was hospitalized after receiving medical aid from prison staff, and an investigation has been initiated by the CCI's Investigative Services Unit and the Kern County District Attorney's Office. Megan Thee Stallion filed a restraining order against Lanez in December of last year, claiming he was harassing her from prison. The incident occurred around 7:20 a.m. on Monday morning at a prison housing unit, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have revealed their tax bill, featuring temporary enactment of President Trump’s pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, rolling back clean energy subsidies, and establishing new tax-advantaged investment accounts for children. The bill aims to extend provisions from Trump’s 2017 tax law, including lower marginal income tax rates and a larger standard deduction, but also includes tax increases to offset costs, potentially adding $2.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. While it raises the state and local tax deduction limit to $30,000, some Republicans find it insufficient, signaling challenges in securing enough votes for passage.</p>

          <p>A museum has opened in Brněnec, Czech Republic, at the site of a former textile factory where Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews during World War II. The Museum of Survivors is dedicated to the Holocaust and Jewish history in the region, with the opening coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the end of the war. Daniel Löw-Beer, whose family owned the plant before the Nazis seized it, spearheaded the project to restore the site and share the stories of Schindler, his wife Emilie, and the survivors. The museum aims to be a universal place of survivors, where stories can be shared and opinions formed.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers lead with the counter-terrorism investigation into a fire at Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's home, with police investigating a possible link to a second home also connected to Starmer. The papers also cover Starmer's new immigration policy, which has drawn criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. The Daily Express questions Starmer's commitment to the policy, while The Guardian reports a backlash from MPs who say his comments echo far-right rhetoric. Meanwhile, the Financial Times focuses on the US and China agreeing to a ceasefire in their trade war, slashing tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days.</p>

          <p>A former top campaign aide to Kamala Harris, David Plouffe, claims that Joe Biden's decision to stay in the 2024 presidential race too long "totally fucked" Harris's chances after Biden withdrew from the race last summer. The book, "Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again," details concerns about Biden's cognitive decline and desperate efforts to conceal it. Obama warned Biden to ensure he could win the race, and others tried to intervene, but Biden stepped aside too late.</p>

The documents, intended to propagate Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina, arrived in 1941 aboard a Japanese steamer. Argentinian customs officials initially warned of the threat to Argentina's neutrality, leading to the cargo's seizure. The contents, including propaganda and materials from the National Socialist German Workers' Party, are now being surveyed, digitized, and reviewed to uncover information about the Holocaust and the regime's finances.</p>
