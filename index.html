          <p>A Department of Homeland Security initiative has uncovered extensive abuse and exploitation of unaccompanied migrant children who were placed with improperly vetted sponsors. The report details cases where sponsors engaged in forced labor, sexual abuse, and neglect, with some having prior convictions for serious crimes. The initiative, launched in February, aims to locate at-risk children and hold accountable those who exploited the system's previous vulnerabilities. This article highlights the ongoing efforts by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations to conduct welfare checks and ensure the safety of these children.</p>

          <p>North Korea has officially opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a massive beach resort on its eastern coast designed to accommodate nearly 20,000 domestic visitors. State media portrayed the opening as a major success, showcasing leader Kim Jong Un's focus on developing the nation's tourism industry as a source of foreign currency. The project, which is also expected to welcome Russian tourists, comes as the country cautiously reopens its borders following the pandemic. Analysts suggest the development may have received Russian assistance in exchange for North Korea's support for Moscow's war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A landmark report by the Yoorrook Justice Commission, Australia's first formal truth-telling inquiry, has concluded that British colonists committed genocide against the Indigenous population in the state of Victoria. The inquiry found that mass killings, disease, and violence caused the Aboriginal population to decline by 75% in the two decades following colonization in the 1830s. The report issues 100 recommendations for redress, including potential reparations and a significant overhaul of the education and health systems to address endemic racism. The Victorian government has stated it will carefully consider the findings, which have been described as indisputable by Indigenous leaders.</p>

          <p>A fire at an electrical substation that caused a complete shutdown of Heathrow Airport was the result of a problem that was first identified in 2018 but never fixed, according to a report by the National Energy System Operator. The investigation found that an elevated moisture reading, which indicated an imminent fault, was recorded but the necessary replacement of the component was not actioned by National Grid. The subsequent power outage affected thousands of flights and raised serious questions about the resilience of the UK's critical national infrastructure. The energy regulator Ofgem has opened an investigation into potential license breaches by National Grid.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is preparing to vote on President Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill after it narrowly passed the Senate with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. The legislation includes approximately $4 trillion in tax cuts, new border security funding, and provisions to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. However, it also features significant cuts to health programs like Medicaid and is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to add over $3 trillion to the national deficit. With a slim majority, House Speaker Mike Johnson faces potential opposition from fiscal conservatives within his party.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, confirming that a successor will be chosen through reincarnation. The 90-year-old spiritual leader stated that the process of identifying his 15th reincarnation should follow past Buddhist traditions and be handled by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. This decision ends years of speculation that he might be the last to hold the title. The announcement carries significant political weight, as it implicitly warns China, which claims the authority to approve the next leader, to not interfere in the succession process.</p>

          <p>Alexi Saenz, the leader of a Long Island-based MS-13 clique, is facing sentencing for his role in a federal racketeering case that includes eight murders and other violent crimes. Saenz pleaded guilty to ordering and approving the killings, including the high-profile 2016 slayings of two teenage girls that brought national attention to the gang's brutality. Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, arguing Saenz's crimes were senseless and sadistic. His defense is requesting a 45-year term, citing his remorse and a traumatic upbringing, though prosecutors contend he remains deeply involved in the gang while incarcerated.</p>

          <p>Canada's national men's soccer team is facing significant questions after being eliminated from the Gold Cup by Guatemala, a team ranked 106th in the world. The loss deprived the team of crucial high-stakes matches ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which Canada will co-host. This article analyzes the fallout, pointing to issues with on-field temperament, questionable in-game management by coach Jesse Marsch, and a failure to perform under pressure. While some individual players showed promise during the tournament, the overall performance has left the team with more concerns than answers just a year before the global event.</p>

          <p>An $88 million satellite named MethaneSAT, designed to track greenhouse gas emissions with high precision, has been lost in space after it stopped responding to ground control. The project was a collaboration between the New Zealand government and the U.S.-based Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), with major funding from the Bezos Earth Fund. The mission aimed to hold countries and corporations accountable for their methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. While officials called the development disappointing, the EDF framed it as a setback rather than a failure, emphasizing the valuable knowledge gained from the ambitious project.</p>

          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has explicitly targeted what it calls "disorderly low-price competition," signaling a more direct approach to tackling the intense price wars affecting many of the nation's industries. The term was used at a high-level economic meeting, indicating a formal characterization of a problem previously discussed with vaguer language. Beijing views this aggressive price-cutting as a threat to the economy's health, as it stifles innovation, reduces efficiency, and hinders industrial upgrading. The new focus suggests a push for regulation to guide companies toward quality improvement and market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over the editing of a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris. The lawsuit alleged election interference, a claim legal experts considered weak, leading to concerns that the settlement was made to avoid political pressure, especially as Paramount's sale to Skydance is under review by the Trump-led FCC. The deal, which does not include an apology, has been seen as a blow to journalistic independence at CBS News, whose top executives had opposed settling. This follows similar multi-million dollar settlements by other media companies with Trump.</p>

          <p>The latest version of President Trump's domestic policy bill, recently passed by the Senate, includes a provision to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to build and expand advanced chip facilities in the United States. The move expands upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting a continued bipartisan push to onshore the semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. The bill must still pass the House before the expanded credits can become law. (not investment advice)</p>

This article, an op-ed by prominent economists, argues the deal was a result of pressure from the Trump administration and corporate lobbying, effectively gutting the OECD's Pillar Two framework. The authors contend this move creates an uneven playing field, incentivizes a corporate tax "race to the bottom," and puts the interests of multinationals over those of developing nations and ordinary citizens. They call for a stronger, more inclusive tax system to be developed at the UN. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge determined that the DHS secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner.
