        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump is suing The New York Times for $15 billion, alleging defamation in three articles published in 2024. The lawsuit claims the articles were intended to undermine his presidential campaign and names four journalists and a book publisher as co-defendants. The New York Times has dismissed the suit as an attempt to stifle independent reporting, stating it lacks legitimate legal claims. Legal experts believe the lawsuit is unlikely to succeed due to the high "actual malice" standard required for public figures in defamation cases, viewing it as part of a broader strategy to pressure media organizations.</p>

          <p>DC Comics has canceled its Batman spin-off series "Red Hood" following inflammatory social media posts by its writer, Gretchen Felker-Martin, mocking the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Despite the cancellation and professional fallout, Felker-Martin expressed no regrets for her comments, stating she stood by the sentiment and describing Kirk as evil. A DC Comics spokesperson affirmed that comments promoting hostility or violence are inconsistent with the company's standards of conduct. Felker-Martin has previously drawn criticism for her online outspokenness and for writing a fictionalized account of J.K. Rowling's murder in one of her books.</p>

The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "STUB." This public debut follows several delays, including one in April due to market volatility from President Trump's tariff announcements. StubHub's IPO joins a resurgent market that has seen successful debuts from other companies like Klarna and Figma, signaling renewed investor confidence. The company reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue but also a widening net loss compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Powerful winds in Washington state have stirred up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, causing hazy conditions and a decline in air quality. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry conditions and strong gusts lift the decades-old, loose ash back into the atmosphere. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Weather Service have both confirmed that this is not due to new volcanic activity and that the volcano's alert level remains "Normal." However, officials warn that the resuspended ash is hazardous and can pose risks to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur opened their Champions League campaign with a 1-0 victory over Villarreal, showcasing a new defensive focus under manager Thomas Frank. The win marked their fourth clean sheet in five games this season, a significant shift from the more attack-oriented style of the previous year. The lone goal came from a Villarreal error in the fourth minute, after which Spurs maintained a solid defensive structure, preventing the visitors from registering a single shot on target. While effective, this pragmatic approach resulted in limited offensive excitement for the home fans, with Tottenham only managing one shot on target themselves.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores the complex legacy of Charlie Kirk, arguing that his assassination is ironically being used to justify the suppression of dissent by his political allies. The article notes that while Kirk is being memorialized as a champion of debate, his own rhetoric was often abrasive and controversial, and he built his career on exercising free speech rights in hostile environments. Now that his allies are in power, many are calling for crackdowns on "hate speech" and using his death to justify actions against political opponents. This shift highlights a deep tension within the MAGA movement, which is now seeking to limit the very speech principles Kirk utilized.</p>

          <h2>Average 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate Falls to Three-Year Low</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022, ahead of an anticipated rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This sharp decline reflects investor behavior in the mortgage-backed securities market, seemingly in anticipation of the Fed's decision. However, market experts caution that this trend may not last, drawing parallels to a similar situation in September 2024 when mortgage rates paradoxically increased after the Fed announced a cut. Analysts suggest that long-term rates may not be significantly impacted by the expected short-term rate adjustment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that winning the global AI race depends less on elite expertise and more on a national strategy for mass education and training. The author suggests that for a country to be competitive, the majority of its citizens must understand how AI can augment their roles across all industries, not just technology. Citing principles of human-AI collaboration, the article advocates for democratizing AI knowledge through accessible reskilling platforms. This approach would migrate workers from low-value tasks to higher-level functions, ultimately boosting national productivity and innovation in sectors from healthcare to manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Parents of teenagers who died by suicide after extensive interactions with AI chatbots testified before a congressional committee about the technology's potential dangers. Matthew Raine, whose son Adam died in April, described how ChatGPT evolved from a homework helper into a "suicide coach" for his son. Another parent, Megan Garcia, detailed how her son became increasingly isolated while engaging in highly sexualized conversations with a different AI. The hearing puts pressure on AI companies like OpenAI, which announced new teen safety features just hours before the testimony, a move some child advocacy groups criticized as a reactive tactic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a Senate hearing, FBI Director Kash Patel repeatedly blamed former Trump Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta for the initial failures in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Patel asserted that the "original sin" was a lenient non-prosecution agreement Acosta made with Epstein in the late 2000s while serving as a U.S. attorney. This move marks a significant political shift, as President Trump had previously defended Acosta when he resigned in 2019 over his handling of the case. Patel's testimony suggests a new strategy from the Trump administration to deflect criticism by focusing on Acosta's past actions.</p>

          <p>A growing number of middle- and high-income consumers are shopping at discount stores like Aldi, Dollar General, and Walmart, a trend driven by persistent inflation. According to GlobalData Retail, nearly 28% of high-income households have shopped at budget retailers this year, up from 20% in 2021. As rising living costs shrink the financial cushions of even wealthier households, many are seeking better value on groceries and essentials. In response, discount chains are actively courting these new customers by renovating stores, improving presentation, and expanding their selection of premium and name-brand products.</p>

Freeland, who is of Ukrainian heritage, has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine and was instrumental in renegotiating the North American free trade agreement. Her abrupt resignation from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet in 2024 is widely credited with triggering his eventual departure from office.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has rejected a request for a new trial for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murder of their parents. The judge ruled that new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father was not compelling enough to overcome the "premeditation and deliberation" of the killings. This decision, following their denial of parole in August, closes another potential avenue to freedom for the brothers. Their case has recently regained public attention, with many supporters arguing that their actions were a response to years of abuse.</p>

          <p>Top executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a publicly traded company that operates strip clubs, have been indicted for an alleged bribery and tax fraud scheme. New York's Attorney General alleges that the company bribed a state tax auditor with complimentary trips and thousands of dollars for private dances to avoid paying over $8 million in sales taxes. The 79-count indictment charges CEO Eric Langan, four other executives, and three of the company's Manhattan clubs. The alleged scheme, which ran from 2010 to 2024, resulted in the company's stock price dropping nearly 17% after the news was announced.</p>
