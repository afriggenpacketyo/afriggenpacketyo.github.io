          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old man with "nihilistic ideations," as the suspect in the fatal Palm Springs fertility clinic explosion. Bartkus, who is believed to have died in the blast, allegedly targeted the clinic due to his disapproval of people being brought into the world against their will. The suspect detonated explosives outside the clinic on Saturday morning and tried to livestream the attack, said investigators. The FBI is reviewing a manifesto they believe is linked to Bartkus and is seeking the public's help to understand his whereabouts before the attack.</p>
