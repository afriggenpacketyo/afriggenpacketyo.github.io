This marks the second time she has guided the Lionesses to a European title, following their Euro 2025 victory in Switzerland. In that tournament, England defeated Spain in a penalty shootout, where goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was the hero. For her performance, the 24-year-old Chelsea player received the Yashin Trophy for the best goalkeeper of the year, capping a successful night for English football.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revealed several key policy moves, including an imminent executive order to designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the president is targeting groups he claims contribute to political violence. Additionally, the White House is finalizing a framework deal to save TikTok's U.S. operations, placing them under a new joint venture controlled by American investors.

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a 6-3 ruling that allows President Donald Trump's termination of Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter to stand on an interim basis. While upholding the president's action for now, the justices have agreed to expedite a full review of the case. The dispute is considered a high-stakes legal battle that centers on the scope of executive power and the independence of federal agencies. The case will be scheduled for arguments in December to determine the final outcome.</p>

          <p>AquaStar (USA) Corp. has recalled over 85,000 bags of shrimp sold under the Kroger and AquaStar brands across 31 states. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert due to insanitary conditions where the shrimp may have been contaminated with cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. While no products have yet tested positive for the element, the FDA warns that long-term consumption of contaminated food could elevate cancer risk. No illnesses have been reported, and consumers are advised to dispose of the product or return it for a refund.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, is withdrawing from a scheduled town hall on WABC-TV. He cited ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" as a capitulation to President Trump's attacks on free speech. Mamdani stated that now is a time for leadership that actively resists such pressures on fundamental freedoms. His decision has drawn mixed reactions, with a spokesperson for former Governor Andrew Cuomo criticizing the move as a way to avoid difficult questions from reporters.</p>

          <p>Following a significant and prolonged violation of its airspace by Russian military jets, Estonia is urging NATO to adopt a more forceful response. An Estonian lawmaker suggested that future incursions could be met with actions similar to Turkey's 2015 downing of a Russian bomber. The incident, which involved three Russian MiG-31s flying over Estonia for 12 minutes, prompted Estonia to invoke Article 4 consultations with NATO. The debate within the alliance is now focused on whether to adopt a more aggressive deterrence strategy to counter Russia's pattern of provocations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's stop-work order on the Revolution Wind farm, allowing the nearly completed project to resume construction. The Danish energy company Orsted had sued the Interior Department after it halted the project, which is set to provide power to over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. In his ruling, Judge Royce Lamberth noted the project was 80% complete and that the company would suffer irreparable harm if the order remained. The decision marks a setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry.</p>

His stance, which dismisses fears of inflation from tariffs, contrasts sharply with that of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

          <h2>Better Home & Finance Stock Surges After Recommendation from Prominent Hedge Fund Manager</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. more than doubled at one point on Monday after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson recommended the stock. Jackson, known for his influence on the trading of Opendoor, called Better Home "the Shopify of mortgages" and suggested it could be a "350-bagger in 2 years." His firm, EMJ Capital, has taken a position in the company, which he argues is undervalued compared to newly public competitors like Figure Technology Solutions. The endorsement triggered a massive surge in trading volume for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the official start of fall, leaf-peeping season is underway across the United States, though climate change is causing delays compared to historical patterns. Foliage prediction maps from sources like the Old Farmer's Almanac estimate that northern regions will see peak colors by early October, with the vibrant hues moving south later in the month. Experts note that timing and intensity can vary based on local factors like temperature and rainfall. For the best views, they recommend monitoring updates from state forestry agencies and exploring different elevations or areas with varied conditions.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines, which has filed for bankruptcy twice this year, is furloughing about 1,800 of its 5,200 flight attendants as it undergoes major restructuring. The layoffs, effective December 1, are part of a broader plan to reduce costs by aligning staffing with a smaller fleet and reduced flight volume. The budget carrier has been struggling with low demand for domestic leisure travel as consumers cut back on spending. The airline's pilot union has also been informed that Spirit is seeking approximately $100 million in annual cost savings from its pilots.</p>

          <p>Mixed messaging from federal and state health officials is causing confusion among parents regarding childhood vaccinations. A CDC advisory panel recently delayed a vote on the timing of the hepatitis B shot and recommended stopping universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, creating divergence from established medical consensus. In response, some states are forming coalitions to encourage widespread vaccination, while others, like Florida, plan to roll back mandates. Pediatricians express concern that these conflicting signals could lead to more vaccine hesitancy and an increase in preventable childhood illnesses.</p>

          <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has organized an open letter, signed by over 400 prominent entertainers, in support of Jimmy Kimmel. The letter condemns the suspension of his show as a "dark moment for freedom of speech" resulting from government pressure on a private company. Signatories include Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who argue that such actions threaten the livelihoods of creatives and run counter to constitutional values. The letter calls for a united front to protect the right to speak freely without fear of reprisal from those in power.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial critiques President Trump's recent statements, particularly his admission that he "hates his opponents" during a memorial for Charlie Kirk. The article argues that Trump's administration is creating a state of emergency where speech is framed as terrorism and dissent is treated as disloyalty. By blurring the lines between truth and lies, such as with claims about Tylenol and autism, he erodes public trust for political gain. The piece concludes that this approach inverts the American model of free speech, replacing robust debate with a system of reprisal and control.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, has rested his defense case after just a few hours. Representing himself, Routh called only three witnesses, including a former Marine sniper who testified about the rifle found at the scene. Throughout the proceedings, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon repeatedly admonished Routh for not following judicial rules. After his witnesses testified, Routh declined to take the stand himself, and the jury is now set to hear closing arguments.</p>

Altman added that streamlining the process for getting the smartest people into the country and outlining financial incentives "seems good." The new fee represents a major shift for the tech sector, which relies heavily on the H-1B program.</p>
