          <p>According to a New York Times polling average, President Trump's approval rating has steadily decreased during his initial three months in office, falling to approximately 45% from 52% shortly after assuming office. This decline is slightly more rapid than that of his predecessors. Notably, Trump began his term with the second-lowest approval rating among modern presidents, only surpassing his own previous entry into office. This reflects a significant shift in public sentiment regarding his performance and policy decisions.</p>

SK Hynix also highlighted the impact of AI on the memory market, noting increased spending from Big Tech and the expansion of the AI ecosystem, while announcing plans to build a new fabrication facility in South Korea to expand its production of next-generation DRAM.

          <p>Water firms in the UK have admitted that self-monitoring of sewage pollution is damaging public trust and are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system. The industry body, Water UK, suggests this move to the government's independent review into the water sector. This comes after incidents of misreporting by water companies and concerns that the Environment Agency lacks the capacity to conduct its own checks. A National Audit Office report is expected to highlight these capacity issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meme coin, which had previously declined significantly in value, experienced a surge after its website announced an offer for the top 220 holders to attend an 'intimate private dinner' with the president. The value of the meme coin increased by as much as 58% following the announcement, which promised investors the opportunity to hear from Trump about the future of cryptocurrency. The promotion has drawn criticism from lawmakers and anti-corruption groups.</p>

          <h2>States Sue Trump Over His Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 20:12:02 EDT</div>

          <p>A dozen states, primarily led by Democrats, have initiated legal action against President Trump concerning his implementation of tariffs, asserting that he lacks the authority to unilaterally impose such measures. The states contend that only Congress possesses the power to legislate tariffs and are requesting the court to impede the Trump administration from enforcing what they deem to be unlawful levies. This action follows a similar lawsuit filed by California, alleging that the administration's trade war has inflicted substantial harm on the state's economy.</p>

          <h2>International Tourism to the U.S. Declines</h2>

          <p>International tourism to the U.S. is slumping, with air travel falling nearly 10% in March compared to the previous year, while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas. This imbalance is widening the gap between U.S. revenue from tourism services and American spending abroad, raising concerns for the U.S. travel industry. Factors contributing to the decline include trade wars, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar, while the appetite for international travel among American consumers remains strong.</p>
