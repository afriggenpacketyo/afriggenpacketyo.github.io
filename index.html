          <p>Beijing is preparing for a major military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which will showcase the People's Liberation Army's most advanced weaponry. While not officially focused on Taiwan, the display of new fighter jets, missiles, and carrier-based aircraft is widely interpreted as a strategic message to the self-ruled island. Military analysts suggest the event will demonstrate China's combat readiness and hint at the future direction of its military policy, particularly concerning its capabilities in a potential Taiwan conflict.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the near-absence of France's colonial history and involvement in the slave trade from its national cinema, contrasting it with Hollywood's frequent depiction of American slavery. It highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" that are beginning to address these topics. Despite audience readiness and critical acclaim, these films struggle for mainstream recognition and are often marginalized by major festivals like Cannes, indicating a broader cultural reluctance to confront this past.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since November, with analysts forecasting continued gains through 2025. The appreciation is attributed to China's resilient macroeconomic data and a growing investor concern over the sustainability of US government debt and fiscal policies. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs predict the yuan will break the 7 per dollar mark within six months, driven by shifting client sentiment on China's growth outlook and fading confidence in US economic exceptionalism.

Panelists argued that reliance on English-based models from major tech companies limits diverse perspectives and that nations, particularly in regions like ASEAN, should take ownership of their AI systems. The use of open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services were highlighted as key strategies to democratize AI development and foster a collective energy that benefits entire countries.</p>

          <p>A private survey, the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. This divergence is attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with the Caixin survey focusing more on smaller, export-oriented firms that may be front-loading shipments to avoid US tariffs. Despite the positive production reading, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, suggesting potential headwinds and continued caution among business owners.

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning 200 of the approximately 4,000 California National Guard members from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to help with wildfire preparations. The deployment, ordered by President Trump over the governor's objections to handle immigration-related protests, has been criticized for depleting the state's firefighting resources during peak season. This potential shift comes amid an ongoing legal battle over the legality of the federalization of the state's Guard forces for the Los Angeles mission.</p>
