          <p>This article chronicles the relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, starting with Musk's endorsement of Trump after an assassination attempt in 2024. Musk was appointed to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump's re-election, working alongside Vivek Ramaswamy to cut federal spending. Tensions rose in 2025 when Musk publicly criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a public feud involving insults traded on social media and threats to government contracts. The article details the escalating conflict and the resulting fallout, including Tesla's stock price decline. The partnership was once seen as a powerful alliance, but ultimately dissolved due to conflicting views and egos.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the possibility of another "China shock" due to overcapacity in Chinese manufacturing. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts on exports as domestic demand remains weak, which could flood global markets with cheap goods. While this situation raises concerns about squeezing local industries, economists suggest it could also provide a silver lining by lowering costs for consumers in inflation-hit economies. This influx of low-cost goods may offer central banks some relief as they try to balance lowering living costs with reviving growth amid trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Mann's literary genius reflected his life spent wandering between diverse worlds, especially after escaping Nazi Germany. He gained global fame for works like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain". During and after the Nazi dictatorship, Mann wrote political essays and delivered radio speeches to his compatriots about the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust, solidifying his legacy as a voice for democracy.</p>

          <p>India's central bank delivered a larger-than-expected rate cut, lowering its benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra attributed the move to softening inflation and slower growth amid global challenges. While the decision follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI highlighted growth concerns amid tariff threats and revised its inflation outlook downward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite fears that artificial intelligence (AI) could automate jobs and cut wages, new research by PwC suggests AI actually makes people "more valuable, not less." The report found that jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations, including those that are the most automatable. Wages of workers with AI skills are on average 56% higher compared to workers without these skills. The report challenges common myths about AI's impact, such as its effect on productivity, wages, job numbers, inequality, skills, and automation.</p>

A leading criminologist attributes the increase to resource issues caused by cuts to police forces. Former officers describe the overwhelming amount of evidence they handle, making it unsurprising that items are lost or damaged.</p>
