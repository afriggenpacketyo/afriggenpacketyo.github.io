          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that federal immigration agents have taken into custody the family of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attempted murder in the fire attack on demonstrators in Colorado. Authorities are investigating whether Soliman's family had knowledge of or supported the attack. Soliman, an Egyptian national, entered the U.S. legally in August 2022 on a tourist visa and applied for asylum the following month, though his visa expired in February 2023. The investigation is ongoing, and the family is being processed by ICE.</p>

          <p>Five aid workers were killed in an attack on a United Nations convoy in Sudan's Darfur region, preventing essential food deliveries to families facing starvation. UNICEF and the World Food Programme condemned the attack, which occurred near the town of Koma, and called for an immediate investigation. The convoy, consisting of 15 trucks, was attempting to reach el-Fasher city, a stronghold of the Sudanese military, and had traveled over 1,800 kilometers from Port Sudan. The RSF and Sudan's military-led government are trading blame for the attack amidst the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Sudan. </p>

          <p>The Dutch government collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his far-right party from the governing coalition due to a dispute over migration policies. Wilders pushed for stricter asylum measures, leading to the end of the uneasy coalition that had been in place for less than a year. Former coalition partners have accused Wilders of engineering the crisis, while Wilders intends to become prime minister in the next elections. The collapse has had minimal economic impact so far, and the ministers will remain in a caretaker capacity until new elections are held, likely in the autumn.</p>

The ruling did not address the merits of California's lawsuit, which challenges Trump's authority to impose tariffs without input from Congress. Three separate US appeals courts may simultaneously consider the legality of Trump's tariffs. California argues that any federal court can hear the case because it raises constitutional objections to Trump's use of tariff powers.</p>
