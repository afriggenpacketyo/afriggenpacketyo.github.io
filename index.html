            <p>Scotland is under an extreme wildfire warning as unseasonably dry weather persists, with temperatures exceeding April averages. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is actively battling ongoing wildfires and urging the public to exercise caution. Multiple fires have been reported across the country, including a significant blaze on the Isle of Arran, prompting safety warnings for hillwalkers. However, a shift to more typical April conditions is expected on Sunday, bringing rain showers and lower temperatures, offering potential relief from the heightened fire risk. </p>

            <p>Beijing experienced severe weather conditions, including sandstorms and high winds, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closure of public parks. Wind speeds reached up to 148 kph (92 mph), felling trees and causing damage to homes across the capital. The city's two major international airports, Beijing Capital and Daxing, were significantly impacted, and tourist attractions like the Forbidden City and Universal Studios were temporarily closed. China has been working to combat the impact of sandstorms originating from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts, which can severely reduce visibility and cause discomfort.</p>

            <p>The United States and Iran have initiated talks in Muscat, Oman, to discuss Iran's nuclear program, marking the highest level of engagement since President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the previous nuclear agreement in 2018. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi expressed the country's desire for a "fair agreement" based on equal footing. The meetings are expected to focus on establishing a framework for negotiations, with Iran seeking sanctions relief in exchange for limiting its nuclear program, while the U.S. aims to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>

The move aims to address concerns about CoStar's aggressive investment in its residential marketplace business, Homes.com, which is draining profits from its core business.

A portion of Vietnam's rising exports to the U.S. may be Chinese products that were rerouted to evade higher tariff rates. The U.S. is considering imposing higher tariff rates on Vietnam due to its trade surplus, which may be partly attributed to this rerouting.</p>

            <p>The core debate surrounding President Trump's tariff war revolves around the balance between preserving American jobs and ensuring access to affordable goods for consumers. While tariffs could potentially protect jobs in specific industries by discouraging imports, U.S. consumers would likely bear the cost through higher prices. Regions with high exposure to import competition from China have suffered manufacturing job losses, but other Americans have benefited from more affordable goods.</p>

This action aligns with Project Esther, a plan from the Heritage Foundation advocating for a crackdown on groups critical of Israel, which some see as a Christian nationalist project. Critics argue that these measures stifle free speech, undermine constitutional protections, and could ultimately stoke antisemitism by making Jews the face of authoritarian crackdowns.</p>

            <p>Biotechnology company Colossal Biosciences announced they had "de-extincted" the dire wolf, creating three pups using gene editing with gray wolf DNA. However, experts at the La Brea Tar Pits, home to thousands of dire wolf fossils, are skeptical, stating the pups are genetically engineered gray wolves with dire wolf traits. The company defends its claim, citing the International Union for Conservation of Nature's definition of de-extinction, while emphasizing their conservation efforts and hopes to inspire more people to pursue careers in science.</p>

The directive aims to increase American timber production by 25%, streamline forest management, and reduce wildfire risks.

The order has stirred tensions between the state and the president, who has previously blamed California's wildfires on the state government's land management policies.</p>

            <p>A new study has found that crows possess geometric intuition, being able to distinguish between regular and irregular four-sided shapes. This marks the first time this ability has been demonstrated in a species other than humans. Researchers tested carrion crows by having them identify the outlier in a group of shapes, showing they had a sense of right angles, parallel lines, and symmetry. The findings suggest that human geometric abilities may build on precursor capabilities more present in the animal kingdom than previously thought.</p>

The White House is considering ways to help farmers, potentially through a mitigation effort similar to the aid provided during the first Trump administration's trade dispute with China. However, farmers emphasize that they prefer markets over government aid and that the subsidies are only a short-term fix for the longer-term damage caused by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A three-year legal saga over the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with health problems and mental disabilities, concluded with a jury finding five former corrections officers not liable. Givens was found dead in his cell at Marion Correctional Treatment Center in 2022, and his sister sued for $15 million, alleging the officers participated in a savage beating. The defense argued Givens had a seizure and fell, causing the injuries. The case raised broader questions about conditions at the facility and led to an FBI investigation and media coverage of other inmates hospitalized for hypothermia.</p>
