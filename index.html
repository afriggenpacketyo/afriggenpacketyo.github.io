            <h2>IDF Inquiry Reveals Failures in Killing of Gaza Medics</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 16:27:44 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An IDF inquiry into the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month found a series of "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, claiming that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The incident occurred in a "hostile and dangerous combat zone" with "poor night visibility," leading the commander to misidentify the vehicles as ambulances. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed, and another commanding officer will be reprimanded.</p>

            <p>Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of violating the one-day Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin, with both sides reporting overnight attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that his forces recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults, while Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Ukrainian forces launched attacks in the Donetsk region and sent 48 drones into Russian territory. Despite the mutual accusations, Zelenskyy noted a decrease in air raid sirens, while President Trump expressed hope for a deal between the two countries this week.</p>

            <p>Downtown Los Angeles experienced a destructive act of vandalism as numerous trees were chainsawed along South Grand Street and other areas, drawing condemnation on social media. The Los Angeles Police Department and the city’s Urban Forestry Division have yet to comment, but social media images show trees severed at the base or several feet above the pavement. The felled trees, many of which appeared to be drought-resistant Indian Laurel Figs, provided benefits such as stormwater runoff capture, air purification, and cooling in the urban environment.</p>

            <p>Leicester City faces relegation after a calamitous season marked by managerial changes, internal struggles, and a lack of goals.

Concerns have been raised over the standard and intensity of training, and tensions have emerged between the manager and players.

The White House has stated it cannot force the Salvadoran government to release Abrego Garcia, despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return.

            <p>The Supreme Court issued a temporary halt to the removal of alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. Solicitor General John Sauer argued that the detainee plaintiffs lack standing to seek an injunction, as the government has paused their deportations. Sauer implored the justices to limit the order to only AEA removals, not any removals of Venezuelan alleged gang members. The Court's decision came after the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants.</p>

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start.

Goolsbee expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook but acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs. Sectors affected by Trump's tariffs, particularly the auto industry, are most likely to heavily stock up on inventory now before import levies on goods from other countries potentially rise further.</p>
