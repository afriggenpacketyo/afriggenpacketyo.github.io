          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage, known as Ship 36, exploded at the company's Starbase facility in Texas during preparations for an engine test firing, resulting in a major setback for the Super Heavy-Starship program. The explosion occurred while the Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and methane fuel, causing significant damage to the test site infrastructure and likely delaying the next test flight. SpaceX confirmed the incident, stating that all personnel were safe and accounted for, and that they are working to secure the site; the company has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. NASA is relying on this rocket for lunar landings, and the accident will make the schedule even more difficult to meet. Optimism score is set accordingly.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long drug smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found in early April while under construction, ran beneath the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and was designed to exit near a commercial warehouse in San Diego. The underground passageway was equipped with lighting, electrical wiring, ventilation, and a track system for transporting contraband. Authorities found the entrance in a house in Tijuana, recently concealed with fresh tile, and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use, with over 95 tunnels having been decommissioned in the San Diego area since 1993. The acting chief patrol agent emphasized the importance of disrupting narcotics smuggling tunnels to protect American lives.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully achieved controlled nuclear reactions between hydrogen and lithium in a compact device, marking a breakthrough in neutron generation technology. This portable neutron gun uses an electromagnetic technique to collide hydrogen protons with lithium atoms, creating nuclear fusion and producing a beam of fast neutrons. The device generates 10 billion neutrons per second, each carrying 3 million electron volts of energy, similar to particles emitted during an atomic bomb explosion. Neutrons' neutrality allows them to penetrate materials, making the gun useful for scientific, industrial, and defense applications.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick has strengthened into an "extremely dangerous" Category 4 storm as it approaches Mexico's Pacific coast, prompting warnings of life-threatening floods and swells. A hurricane warning is in effect for a 500km stretch of coast from Acapulco to Puerto √Ångel, with residents in Guerrero and Oaxaca advised to seek shelter. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum urged people to stay indoors and heed official communications, while around 2,000 shelters have been set up across the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. This is expected to be the first hurricane to make landfall in Mexico this season, and comes after Hurricane Otis caused significant devastation in Acapulco in October 2023.</p>

          <p>An Israeli hospital in Beer Sheba sustained a direct hit from an Iranian missile, causing extensive damage and injuries. Separate Iranian strikes also targeted a high-rise in Tel Aviv, with hospitals reporting wounded individuals. This development occurred as President Trump considered direct U.S. involvement in Israel's efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. Simultaneously, Israel attacked Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, prompting evacuations and claims of no radiation danger. The conflict has intensified, with both sides exchanging airstrikes and missiles, resulting in numerous casualties and widespread destruction.</p>

Despite conditions such as an $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel operations and a golden share issued to the U.S. government, Hashimoto believes the deal is efficient and profitable for both companies. Under the national security agreement, the U.S. president has the right to approve key management decisions, including facility closures. Nippon Steel aims to increase its global capacity to 100 million tons and expand into overseas markets to compensate for declining domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster to reveal remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in central London. Discovered in 2021, the frescoes depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area during Roman times. The team believes the building may have been home to a wealthy family or a hotel for rich travelers, and the art was created by skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire. The discovery sheds light on the expansion of Roman London and the city's rich history.</p>

The Cook Islands responded by saying it would address the issue urgently, while New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is currently on an official visit to China.

Drawing parallels with past interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, he emphasizes that regime destruction does not guarantee successful regime change. A defeated Iran could lead to civic instability and prolonged conflict, as there is no clear successor government and the country remains a large, proud, and well-armed state. Caution is advised, as history demonstrates that regime change for revolutionary regimes is a particularly messy business.</p>

          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the current owner of the L.A. Dodgers, for a valuation of $10 billion. Jeanie Buss will retain the title of governor, representing the team in league matters, with the sale shattering the record for the largest sports team sale in history. Walter also owns the Professional Women's Hockey League, the Los Angeles Sparks, and has interests in Chelsea and the Cadillac Formula 1 racing team. This sale follows the Lakers' recent acquisition of Luka Donƒçiƒá, further solidifying their position in the NBA.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, urged the U.S. to "look at the whole picture" regarding tariffs and trade ties, stating that the trade relationship is "generally balanced." Xie criticized the "unreasonably high" tariffs on Chinese imports and argued that the U.S. goods deficit would persist due to export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms. He suggested that the U.S. should ease restrictions on exports of competitive products like semiconductors to reduce the deficit. Recent talks have produced a framework to implement a trade consensus, including reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, signaling potential progress in easing trade tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments by altering their products to fit different harmonized system codes. This legal practice involves changing an item's materials or dimensions to qualify for lower tariff rates. Companies are tweaking products to meet specific tariff classifications, such as adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry or adding fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. This strategy is most easily implemented in sectors like fast-moving consumer goods and garments, though challenges exist in heavily-regulated industries. (not investment advice)</p>
