          <p>Former President Trump has issued a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to agree to a U.S.-backed peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The proposal, endorsed by Israel, calls for the release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. The plan also involves establishing a "technocratic" Palestinian committee and a temporary Arab-backed security force. Trump warned that if the agreement is not reached, "all HELL" will break out against Hamas.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich in Oregon, a crucial piece of evidence was accidentally destroyed before police could examine it. A minivan, believed to be the primary crime scene, was located at a metal scrapyard but was crushed into scrap just a week before detectives arrived. The suspect in the case is Dr. Steven Milner, a former veterinarian who allegedly stalked the victim after having an affair with the victim's wife. The loss of the vehicle represents a significant setback for the prosecution's forensic case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a Hawaii law that significantly restricts where individuals with concealed carry permits can bring handguns. The law prohibits firearms on private property open to the public, such as stores and restaurants, unless the owner gives express permission. This case is the latest major Second Amendment dispute to reach the high court since its landmark 2022 decision that expanded gun rights. The Trump administration had urged the court to take up the case, arguing the law functions as a near-total ban on public carry.</p>

          <p>A cultural analysis of Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," suggests she is openly embracing her long-held ambition for fame and success. The article argues that after years of cultivating a more relatable persona, Swift is now unapologetically acknowledging the hard work and desire that have fueled her career. This shift is framed as particularly significant in the current cultural climate, challenging traditional expectations for female artists. The album's final track concludes with the line, "I wouldn’t have it any other way."</p>

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs appeared in court Friday for his sentencing hearing, where he is expected to address the judge directly. A key development was the withdrawal of a victim impact statement from a former assistant, who prosecutors said bowed out due to a "bullying" letter from the defense. In a letter submitted to the court, Combs apologized for his conduct and stated that he has been working to reform himself while in prison. Several of his children and a pastor are also expected to speak on his behalf.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a strong condemnation of Mexico's recent anti-dumping investigations into Chinese goods, vowing to "take all necessary measures" to protect its companies. Beijing noted that Mexico has launched 11 such probes this year, a significant increase from last year. The statement also criticized the United States, suggesting that Mexico is being coerced into taking a tougher trade stance against China. China urged Mexico to adhere to WTO rules and resist protectionist pressures.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has removed ICEBlock and other similar applications from its App Store. These apps allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Attorney General Pam Bondi had demanded the removal, and Apple cited information from law enforcement about safety risks as the reason for its decision. The move came after reports that a gunman who attacked an ICE facility had searched for such apps prior to the incident.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that he is wary of cutting interest rates too quickly amid conflicting economic signals. In an interview, he noted that the central bank is in a "sticky spot," with a recent uptick in inflation occurring at the same time as a deterioration in payroll job numbers. Goolsbee expressed concern about pressures on both sides of the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and low unemployment, suggesting a gradual approach to any future rate reductions is prudent.

          <p>Munich Airport experienced significant disruptions on Thursday evening after sightings of unauthorized drones forced a temporary halt to all air traffic. The closure resulted in the cancellation of more than 30 flights, affecting approximately 3,000 passengers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Grocers across the U.S., including major chains like Walmart and Kroger, are increasingly adopting electronic shelf labels to replace traditional paper price tags. This technology allows retailers to update prices across a store in minutes using a mobile app, a process that previously took days. While companies tout the efficiency gains, some lawmakers have raised concerns that digital tags could pave the way for "dynamic pricing," where costs could surge during peak demand. However, retailers and industry experts currently deny any plans for such a strategy.</p>
