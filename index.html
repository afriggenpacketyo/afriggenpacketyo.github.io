          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House for critical discussions aimed at ending the war with Russia. Sitting alongside European leaders, Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his personal efforts to stop the conflict, while Trump indicated that security guarantees for Ukraine, with U.S. involvement, would be discussed later in the day. Trump expressed a desire to end the war, which he believes the world is tired of, but remained noncommittal on the timeline or the future of U.S. support if a deal is not reached. The meeting's context is heightened by a recent, contentious Oval Office encounter and Trump's prior summit with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:31:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend dubbed "job hugging" has emerged, replacing the recent era of job-hopping as workers increasingly cling to their current roles amid economic uncertainty. The national quits rate has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting decreased worker confidence in finding new employment. This stagnation is driven by a cooling labor market, higher interest rates slowing business expansion, and a decline in the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers. While providing stability, experts warn that this trend could lead to wage stagnation and make it harder for new graduates to enter the workforce.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, restoring the quorum necessary for legislative business and allowing Republicans to resume their controversial mid-decade redistricting effort. Democrats stated their return is a strategic move to build a legal case against what they call a discriminatory map, which could give the GOP up to five new U.S. House seats. The move comes as part of a larger national battle over congressional maps, with Democratic-led states like California proposing their own redistricting plans to counteract potential Republican gains ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated the group's agreement to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators, which is based on a two-stage U.S. framework. The deal would involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages, followed by negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently insisted on the release of all hostages at once. The development occurs amidst intense Israeli strikes on Gaza City and large-scale protests in Tel Aviv demanding the government secure a deal to bring all hostages home.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its defamation lawsuit against the conservative media outlet Newsmax for $67 million, resolving claims that the network broadcasted false allegations of election fraud in 2020. This settlement follows a larger $787 million agreement between Dominion and Fox News for similar claims. Newsmax, which was sued for $1.6 billion, will pay the amount in three installments while maintaining that its coverage was fair and criticizing the judge for what it claims would have been an unfair trial. The case was scheduled to proceed this fall in Delaware, where a judge had previously found that Dominion's complaint was reasonably inferred.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-time leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled for a change of plea hearing and is expected to plead guilty to sweeping U.S. drug trafficking charges. Prosecutors have accused the 77-year-old of overseeing a vast criminal enterprise that flooded the U.S. with illicit drugs and involved ordering murders and torture. This development follows a decision by federal prosecutors not to seek the death penalty and comes after Zambada's arrest in Texas last year. His plea is a significant event in the ongoing U.S. efforts to dismantle the cartel's leadership, which has recently been plagued by violent internal conflict.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:01:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage depends on individual circumstances, including age, equity, income needs, and long-term goals. While homeowners can qualify at 62, waiting until the early 70s is often recommended, as older borrowers can typically access a larger portion of their home's equity. A reverse mortgage can provide tax-free income and eliminate monthly mortgage payments for retirees on a fixed income, but it also reduces the home's equity, potentially affecting inheritances. Homeowners should carefully weigh their health, plans to age in place, and other retirement income sources before committing to this complex financial product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is successfully reaching its target demographic, particularly those facing barriers to healthcare. A study published in JAMA Network Open found that nearly a third of people using the OTC pill, Opill, had previously used no method of contraception at all. The data showed that users of the prescription-free pill were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and live in rural areas. The most cited reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment, highlighting the impact of increased accessibility on contraceptive use.</p>

The outbreak primarily affected children, with two unvaccinated children tragically dying from the highly contagious virus.

The Department of Education's proposed rule aims to halt forgiveness for individuals working for organizations deemed to be "undermining national security and American values through illegal means." Critics and advocates express concern that the vague language could be used to exclude any nonprofit the administration disapproves of, creating a political litmus test for a bipartisan program designed to encourage public service.

          <p>Cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW as part of its spinoff from parent company Comcast's NBC Universal. The new name, which stands for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to establish a separate identity for the channel as it becomes part of a new independent business called Versant. The spinoff will also include CNBC and entertainment networks like USA and E!, all of which will drop the iconic NBC peacock logo. MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler stated the decision allows the brand to set its own course and assert its independence while committing to its core mission.</p>

          <p>Several European heads of government have traveled to Washington to meet with President Trump and President Zelenskyy, aiming to prevent what they fear could be a capitulation to Russia in peace negotiations. Their primary concern is President Trump's recent strategic shift following his meeting with Vladimir Putin, where he reportedly dropped demands for a ceasefire as a precondition for talks and indicated no new sanctions would be imposed on Russia. The European leaders seek to emphasize that any peace deal must involve robust, tangible security guarantees not just for Ukraine, but for the entire European continent, and cannot be achieved by simply ceding territory.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared the ongoing strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal and ordered them to immediately return to their duties. The ruling comes after the union defied a previous back-to-work order, extending a work stoppage that has disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak season. The union and the airline remain far apart on issues of pay and compensation for unpaid work. The board's decision escalates the labor dispute, with uncertainty remaining about the consequences if the union continues to defy the federal tribunal's order.</p>

          <p>Germany's Football Federation (DFB) has launched investigations into two separate incidents of racist abuse that occurred during German Cup matches over the weekend. In one match, Schalke's Christopher Antwi-Adjei confronted fans, leading to a temporary suspension of play, and was subsequently booed by home supporters. In another fixture, a Kaiserslautern player was reportedly insulted by the crowd, with the perpetrator being quickly identified and removed. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has condemned the incidents and called on the DFB to take appropriate measures to punish those responsible, reiterating that there is no place for racism in football.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Zelenskyy meets with U.S. officials, analysis of international support shows that while the United States is the largest single donor, European countries combined have committed more aid since Russia's 2022 invasion. According to the Kiel Institute, European nations have provided $165.7 billion compared to the U.S. total of $130.6 billion through June 2025. This data contradicts some claims that Europe's contributions are lagging significantly behind America's. The aid from both sides consists of a mix of grants and loans, although the U.S. has provided a higher proportion of its financial aid as direct grants.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to U.S. patients paying in cash, less than half of its current list price of nearly $1,350. The move aims to increase access for uninsured or underinsured patients and comes amid significant political pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs. The discounted price will be available through various platforms, including the drug's website and partnerships like GoodRx. This strategy is also seen as an effort to steer patients toward the branded medication and away from potentially unsafe compounded copycats that gained popularity during previous shortages.</p>

This will be the first election since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, a move widely seen as an attempt to create a facade of legitimacy amid an ongoing and brutal civil war. The poll faces significant challenges, as large parts of the country are controlled by opposition forces who have dismissed the election as a sham. Key political parties, including Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, have been banned from participating, raising further doubts about the vote's credibility.</p>

          <p>Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power are partnering to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) grid by 2030. Under the agreement, TVA will purchase up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power from the Hermes 2 reactor to help power Google's regional data centers. This collaboration marks a significant step for advanced nuclear energy, as it is the first U.S. power purchase agreement for such a reactor, with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risk of construction. The project aims to demonstrate the viability of smaller, more affordable nuclear plants to meet the growing energy demands of technologies like artificial intelligence.</p>
