          <p>Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, stated that the company isn't currently observing indications of an impending recession in the U.S., even as President Trump's tariffs are impacting oil demand expectations. Wirth noted that while growth might be slowing, Chevron is prepared but not altering capital spending plans. The International Monetary Fund recently lowered the U.S. growth forecast, citing trade tensions, and Wirth acknowledged potential macroeconomic effects from the tariffs but doesn't foresee a major direct impact on Chevron's business.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly reduced its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, attributing the revision primarily to the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, stated that these tariffs are a major negative shock to growth and have increased the probability of a U.S. recession to 40%. The report also noted that weakening consumer confidence and consumption indicators contributed to the downward revision, and the IMF has also raised its inflation forecast for the U.S. to 3%.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 mark for the first time since March, fueled by investors seeking refuge from turbulent stock markets and a weakening U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency's recent decoupling from risk assets and positive inflows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to its resurgence. However, analysts caution that light trading volumes suggest the need for a significant catalyst, such as Federal Reserve easing or tariff deals, to break above the $93,000 resistance level.

          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that Donald Trump's attacks on public media, including NPR and PBS, are a predictable move to control the political narrative and undermine fact-based reporting. She notes that Trump's actions align with an authoritarian playbook, including disparaging journalists and tightly controlling access to newsmakers. While NPR and PBS are not perfect, they are a critical part of the news ecosystem necessary for democratic self-governance, especially as media ownership becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of corporations and billionaires.</p>

          <p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, one of the greatest Romantic painters, is being celebrated 250 years after his birth, recognized for his mastery of light, color, and atmosphere. Turner's travels through Europe, particularly his fascination with Venice and the Rhine River, inspired his increasingly abstract and mystical landscape paintings. Today, he is considered a pioneer of modernism, a forerunner of abstract art, and a key figure in Rhine Romanticism.</p>
