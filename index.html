          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, was forced to return to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas after flames and smoke were observed coming from its left engine shortly after takeoff. The flight, carrying 153 passengers and six crew members, landed safely without any reported injuries. While initial reports suggested an engine fire, a subsequent inspection by American Airlines maintenance teams found no evidence of a fire. The aircraft, an Airbus A321, has been taken out of service for further evaluation, and the FAA will conduct an investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Richard Gerald Jordan, 79, Mississippi's longest-serving death row inmate, was executed by lethal injection for the 1976 kidnapping and murder of Edwina Marter.

He apologized to the victim's family in his final statement, expressing gratitude for a humane process and asking for forgiveness. Jordan's execution marked Mississippi's first in three years and occurred amid an uptick in capital punishment in the U.S., sparking renewed debate about the ethics and efficacy of the death penalty.</p>

Chronic fuel shortages persist, with long lines at gas stations, and government permission is required to visit heavily damaged areas.

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly called for the cancellation of Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial, labeling it a "witch hunt." Trump expressed his unwavering support for the Israeli Prime Minister, emphasizing their shared experiences battling Iran. Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in three separate cases, allegations he denies, claiming they are politically motivated. The trial, which began in May 2020, has faced numerous delays, and Trump suggested a pardon for Netanyahu, describing him as a "great hero."</p>

The test measures signs of a healthy or defective reaction in the womb lining, which is being piloted to help over 1,000 patients. In some women with a history of miscarriage, the womb lining doesn't react properly, failing to transform into a supportive environment for the embryo.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gas prices in California are anticipated to increase in July due to a state sales tax hike and stricter regulations on refineries aimed at promoting lower-carbon fuels. The combined effect of these changes could raise gas prices by nearly 70 cents per gallon. While oil supply currently outweighs demand, resulting in slightly cheaper prices compared to 2024, California consumers will not experience this relief. The state's gas and diesel excise tax will increase, and amendments to the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program will further incentivize lower-carbon fuel production, adding to the cost for motorists.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans relying on federal food subsidies are bracing for potential cuts as Congress considers President Trump's budget bill. The bill proposes significant reductions to programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), impacting low-income households, older Americans, families with children, and people with disabilities. While Trump promised to lower the cost of living, including grocery prices, prices for common groceries have actually increased. The proposed cuts have sparked debate within the Republican Party, with some fearing the political consequences of reducing support for essential social welfare programs.</p>
