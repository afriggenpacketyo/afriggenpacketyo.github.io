          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will formally recognize a Palestinian state, with the decision to be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. This move comes amid growing international frustration with the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The announcement was strongly condemned by Israel and the United States, who argue it rewards terrorism and undermines peace efforts, while it was praised by the Palestinian Authority and other nations.</p>

He admitted to drawing a swastika on a ballot paper next to the name of a candidate from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Born described his action as a "serious mistake" and a "momentary lapse," while the state parliament president called the act a criminal offense and filed a complaint with police.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that she used to subsist on a tight budget of $40 for three days when she was starting her career, an experience that taught her the value of financial security. A financial expert commented on her story, advising that modern freelancers and artists should focus on building a system to absorb income volatility rather than relying on extreme rationing. The expert recommended a "bucketing strategy," allocating income by percentages to essentials, savings, and discretionary spending.</p>

Additionally, an unapproved external load of moose antlers was strapped to a wing strut, which degraded the plane's performance and led to the pilot losing control.</p>

          <p>This article describes the current food distribution system in Gaza, run by the U.S. and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), as a horrifying failure. With traditional aid agencies barred, Palestinians must risk their lives at a few militarized distribution points, where Israeli forces have reportedly killed over 1,000 people seeking food. The aid provided is critically insufficient, forcing desperate civilians to choose between starvation and the real possibility of being shot, creating what the article calls a death trap.</p>

          <p>Following a "South Park" season premiere that heavily satirized President Donald Trump, co-creator Trey Parker issued a mock-serious apology during a panel at Comic-Con. The episode prompted a White House spokesperson to describe the long-running show as "fourth-rate" and irrelevant. The controversial episode depicted the president in various compromising situations and took aim at his history of lawsuits against media outlets, including the show's parent company, Paramount.</p>

While the two sides found some common ground on climate change cooperation, the meeting underscored a growing strategic divergence and friction over key geopolitical and economic issues.</p>

Slater, who went missing in June after a night out, died from skull fractures and brain trauma after falling down a remote ravine. The inquest heard that he had consumed drugs and alcohol and was attempting a 14-hour walk back to his accommodation, with contributing factors to his fall likely being a lack of suitable clothing and mountain training.</p>
