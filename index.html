          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter, with a 1.3% year-on-year increase, missing estimates due to global trade tensions. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and lower exports. Extreme weather events also negatively impacted mining, tourism, and shipping industries. The Reserve Bank of Australia previously cut rates to a two-year low in May, anticipating a gradual recovery in GDP driven by consumption and public demand.

          <p>A man accused of writing letters threatening to assassinate President Trump was framed, according to investigators. Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant, was initially arrested, but prosecutors now claim the letters were written by Demetric Deshawn Scott. Scott admitted to writing the letters to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying in a robbery case. Morales-Reyes, who doesn't speak fluent English, had handwriting that differed from the letters. This article highlights a case of alleged witness intimidation and the potential for wrongful accusations. The situation underscores the complexities of the legal system and the importance of thorough investigation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to perform abortions in emergency situations. The guidance, issued in 2022, stated that under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), doctors must perform abortions if necessary to stabilize patients. The Trump administration argues that the guidance does not reflect its policy. Abortion rights groups have criticized the decision, while the administration says it will continue to enforce EMTALA to protect individuals seeking emergency treatment.
