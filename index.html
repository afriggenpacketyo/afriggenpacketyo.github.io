          <p>Irish-language rap group Kneecap delivered a politically charged performance at the Glastonbury Festival, drawing a massive crowd despite recent controversy. One member, Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, is facing a terrorism charge, which the band addressed on stage with chants of "Free Mo Chara." The trio also voiced strong support for Palestine and criticized UK political figures who had called for their performance to be canceled. Their set highlighted the ongoing debate around free speech, political expression in music, and the band's contentious use of Irish republican symbolism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to resume enriching uranium for a potential nuclear bomb in "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi said caused severe but not total damage, contradicting claims that the program was "obliterated." The situation is further complicated by Iran's decision to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. Despite the tensions, Grossi emphasized that a long-lasting solution must ultimately be diplomatic.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul, 28, controlled the fight against a largely passive Chavez, who rarely threw punches for most of the contest. The victory, with scores of 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92, continues Paul's winning streak against aging fighters and fuels debate about his legitimacy in professional boxing. Following the win, Paul called out current champions, expressing his ambition to contend for a world title in the near future.</p>

It recounts the investigation, from Blaze's disappearance to the discovery of his body and the forensic evidence linking Woodward, a member of a neo-Nazi group, to the crime. The case, which took six years to go to trial, resulted in Woodward's conviction for first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement.

          <p>France is making a significant financial bet on satellite company Eutelsat, hoping to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. A recent state-led investment has made France the largest shareholder, positioning Eutelsat as a strategic asset for Europe's technological sovereignty. However, industry experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, pointing to the massive disparity in the number of satellites and launch capabilities. Eutelsat's current constellation is less than a tenth the size of Starlink's, suggesting its immediate success may be limited to specialized security and enterprise markets rather than the mass consumer market.</p>

          <p>The first half of the year has been marked by significant market volatility driven by political tensions, setting a precarious stage for the next six months.

Analysts warn that high policy uncertainty and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment could lead to increased equity volatility. Meanwhile, the UK's Labour government faces plummeting approval ratings on its first anniversary, grappling with economic challenges and foreign policy pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite its proximity to Xiamen, it remains a symbol of Taipei's governance, which touts it as a deterrent against the People's Liberation Army.

The move is highly controversial due to the long-term danger mines pose to civilians, but the nations argue it is a necessary deterrent.

Violators could face fines up to â‚¬700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not apply to the terraces of bars and restaurants.

His complaints were initially dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, who accused Hulme of witchcraft, and police were slow to act.

The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat health alert for large parts of England, warning of likely impacts across the health service until Tuesday. A less severe yellow alert is in place for other regions. Health officials are urging the public to stay hydrated, avoid direct sun during peak hours, and check on vulnerable individuals. The current conditions are part of a trend that could see temperatures peak in the mid-30s on Monday.</p>

          <p>Police in Somerset are assessing comments made by rap groups Bob Vylan and Kneecap during their Glastonbury Festival performances to determine if any criminal offenses were committed. Bob Vylan led chants calling for "death" to the Israeli military, prompting condemnation from the UK government and the BBC, which broadcast the set live but will not make it available on-demand. Kneecap's set also featured politically charged statements, adding to the controversy surrounding the festival's inclusion of the artists. The incidents have sparked a wider debate about the limits of artistic expression and hate speech.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. While the events are celebratory, organizers have adopted a more defiant and protest-oriented tone this year in response to a challenging political climate and legislative efforts targeting LGBTQ+ rights. The theme for New York's march is "Rise Up: Pride in Protest." The festivities also face headwinds from reduced corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader pullback from diversity and inclusion initiatives by some American companies.</p>

          <p>Civil servants in China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent local austerity measures that can be even stricter than central government regulations. An official in Sichuan province reported that his department head implemented a dine-out ban in May, reflecting a phenomenon known as "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control. This shift in lifestyle, even if temporary, is a direct response to the ever-changing and often severe anti-corruption and austerity campaigns being enforced at the local level across the country, creating a culture of caution among officials.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's large domestic spending and tax cut package, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," narrowly passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate late Saturday night. The motion to proceed passed 51-49 after hours of negotiations and last-minute vote changes from several Republican holdouts who had concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit. The successful vote, which avoided the need for a tie-breaker from Vice President JD Vance, moves the controversial 940-page bill closer to a final vote. However, its passage remains uncertain as it faces opposition and a narrow majority in the House. (not investment advice)</p>

Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for areas south of Highway 138, with warnings for areas to the north.

          <p>As a heatwave continues in the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," a phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Hard, dark surfaces like buildings and roads absorb and store the sun's heat, releasing it slowly and raising temperatures, especially at night. This effect can make city centers 4-6C warmer on average during heatwaves. With climate change making extreme heat more frequent and intense, the growing urban populations are particularly vulnerable to its dangerous impacts, such as dehydration and poor air quality.</p>

The rocket lifted off from Tanegashima Island, placing a government satellite into orbit to observe greenhouse gas levels and monitor climate change. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has had a 98 percent success rate since 2001. It is now being replaced by the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket, as Japan aims to become more competitive in the global satellite-launch market dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major celebration of human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly spurred by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial "Child Protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban by organizing the event through the city council. The peaceful, vibrant march was seen by many as a powerful demonstration of solidarity against the government's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>
