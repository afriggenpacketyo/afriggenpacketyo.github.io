          <p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, recently sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-established plan to sell up to six million shares. This transaction comes as his personal net worth has surged to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The sale coincides with Nvidia's historic achievement of becoming the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the booming demand for its AI-powering chips. Huang still retains over 858 million shares in the company through various holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for 12 days in the Australian outback. She vanished on June 29 near Beacon, a remote town north of Perth, after her vehicle was found abandoned. An extensive search was conducted, and Wilga was ultimately found by a passing motorist on a regional road. She was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and hunger with minor injuries, and was subsequently airlifted to a hospital in Perth for medical treatment and recovery. Police confirmed she was safe and well after the ordeal.</p>

          <p>London's Gatwick Airport marked a milestone by welcoming its first-ever all-electric flight. The aircraft, a two-seater Pipistrel Velis Electro, landed at the airport as part of a 17-day tour around France. The plane is commercially approved for pilot training and other operations, representing a step forward in sustainable aviation. The event aligns with Gatwick's broader decarbonization strategy, which includes a £250 million program to achieve net-zero emissions and transition its entire 300-vehicle fleet to electric by 2030, demonstrating a commitment to a more sustainable future for air travel.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Cairo to deepen ties with Egypt, pledging to encourage more Chinese companies to invest in the country. This move is part of China's broader strategy to expand its influence in the Middle East through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese investment is already prominent in major Egyptian infrastructure projects, including Africa's tallest skyscraper and the modernization of the country's electrical grid. The discussions with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi focused on enhancing collaboration in trade, manufacturing, renewable energy, and technology, reinforcing a centuries-old connection.</p>

          <p>Six months after the Palisades fire devastated the area, small businesses in Malibu are still struggling to recover, even during what should be their peak summer season. Eateries, surf shops, and souvenir stores along Pacific Coast Highway report that business is down significantly, with some seeing 25-33% less revenue compared to last year. The five-month closure of the highway to nonresidents isolated these businesses from their customer base of tourists and beachgoers. While the road has reopened, the slow return of customers and the changed landscape continue to pose significant financial challenges for the local economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary piece addresses the recent culture war backlash against the new “Superman” movie, which some critics have labeled “superwoke” for its focus on the character being an immigrant. The author argues that this criticism is overblown, as Superman’s origin has always been an immigrant story, created by children of Jewish immigrants. The article contends that the film's core themes are about kindness and the hero's choices, shaped by his upbringing in America's heartland, rather than radical politics. It suggests the controversy ignores the character's long history and the film's actual narrative focus on assimilation and values.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad has found that fuel to the plane's engines was abruptly cut off seconds after takeoff. Data from the flight recorder showed that both fuel-control switches moved from the "run" to the "cut-off" position, causing a total loss of engine thrust. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they cut the fuel, with the other denying having done so. The Boeing 787 crashed less than 40 seconds after becoming airborne, plummeting into a nearby building.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained during a U.S. immigration raid at a cannabis farm in Southern California. The United Farm Workers labor union confirmed the death, stating the worker was injured as a result of the enforcement action where approximately 200 undocumented migrants were arrested. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed the individual was not being pursued by law enforcement when he climbed onto a greenhouse roof and fell 30 feet. The incident, part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, has sparked protests and clashes with federal agents.</p>

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is carefully managing its relationship with the Trump administration as it aims for the French presidency in 2027. While ideologically aligned on issues like nationalism and anti-immigration, the party is wary of close association with President Trump, who is largely unpopular with French voters. The National Rally must also consider the negative economic impact of potential U.S. tariffs on its blue-collar voter base. This has led to a more distant relationship compared to other European populist leaders, as the party seeks to moderate its image to attract mainstream support.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota limiting the number of immigrant students in schools has ignited a national debate. Prien suggested a cap of 30-40% could be a "conceivable model" to aid integration, but the idea has faced sharp criticism from educators, students, and researchers. Opponents argue that such a policy would be discriminatory, impractical to implement, and stigmatize children, while proponents believe it could lead to better academic outcomes. The controversy highlights the broader challenges within Germany's education system, which struggles with performance issues across all student demographics.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' losing streak reached seven games following an 8-7 defeat to the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers' offense, which had been struggling, finally came alive to score seven runs, but it wasn't enough to overcome an early deficit created by a poor start from pitcher Dustin May. Despite a late-game rally that brought them within one run, the Dodgers failed to complete the comeback, stranding runners in the final innings. The loss marks the team's longest skid since 2017 and further shrinks their lead in the division.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that Israel's announced plan to forcibly move Palestinians in Rafah into a contained camp constitutes a crime against humanity. The author contends that while the world decries the demise of international law, it has never truly protected Palestinians, citing decades of unenforced UN resolutions and continued Western support for Israel. The piece suggests that the dehumanization of Palestinians since 1948 has enabled the current atrocities. Ultimately, the author places hope not in failed legal institutions but in the enduring resilience and humanity of the Palestinian people to survive and seek accountability.</p>
