          <p>The Israeli military announced it was mobilizing troops for a major advance into Gaza, aiming to seize more land and displace civilians, which was followed by reports of automatic gunfire heard in central Gaza. This mobilization occurred hours after intense Israeli bombardment overnight, causing some civilians to flee westward. These developments take place as mediators seek to broker a new temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, who have been at war since October 7, 2023. Despite the immense toll of Israelâ€™s military campaign, the fighting has failed to decisively defeat Hamas or secure the release of all hostages, while the United Nations warns of widespread hunger among Gazaâ€™s two million Palestinians due to a blockade.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for the first round of its presidential election, which will determine whether the pro-European government led by Donald Tusk can advance its reform plans, currently blocked by President Andrzej Duda. Tusk is backing Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, while Duda supports Karol Nawrocki, head of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance. The election's outcome will significantly impact the government's ability to implement promised changes, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing abortion legislation. Disappointment over the lack of progress has led to discontent, making the election a crucial test for Tusk's coalition.</p>

          <p>Australia has condemned a Russian-controlled court's sentencing of an Australian citizen to 13 years in a penal colony for fighting with Ukrainian forces. Foreign Minister Penny Wong called the verdict a "sham trial" and insisted that Oscar Jenkins, as a member of Ukraine's regular armed forces, should be treated as a prisoner of war under international law. Australia is working with Ukraine and the Red Cross to ensure Jenkins' welfare and seek his release, emphasizing that Russia is obligated to treat him humanely according to international humanitarian law.

          <p>Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura's testimony is central to the federal sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution case against Sean "Diddy" Combs.

Prosecutors aim to prove Combs ran a criminal enterprise, while his attorneys concede abuse but deny sex trafficking. The trial hinges on whether prosecutors can demonstrate force, fraud, or coercion beyond domestic violence, with Ventura's account of control, blackmail, and the involvement of Combs's associates being critical to the case.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo sarin attack on Tokyo's subway, dozens of abused and malnourished children were rescued from the cult's compound. These children, separated from their parents and ruthlessly indoctrinated, were largely forgotten amidst the focus on the perpetrators. Mitsuo Hosaka, a child welfare worker, took charge of 53 of these children, providing them with a safe space and helping them reintegrate into society. The children had endured abuse, brainwashing, and isolation within the cult, but gradually began to regain their childlike selves through nourishment, play, and trust in caregivers.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, as part of a bill to fund President Donald Trump's agenda, are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for health insurance. An analysis estimates that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While some Republicans argue the cuts will only eliminate fraud and waste, individuals and families who depend on Medicaid fear they will lose access to essential healthcare services, forcing them to choose between healthcare and basic necessities. Work requirements for Medicaid recipients are also a point of concern, potentially jeopardizing care for those in recovery from substance use disorder.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's earlier announcement to shut down seven vehicle plants and reduce its global workforce by 20,000 jobs due to a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal year 2024. The plants under consideration are the Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant, which manufactures commercial vehicles, together accounting for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The final decision hinges on discussions with labor unions, parts suppliers, and local municipalities, while Nissan has already confirmed closures of overseas plants in India and Argentina.</p>
