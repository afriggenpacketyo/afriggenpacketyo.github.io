        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>S&P Global Ratings has significantly worsened its forecast for China's real estate sector, projecting an 8% decline in new home sales for 2025, far steeper than its previous estimate. The report attributes the prolonged slump to persistently fragile homebuyer sentiment and suggests that Beijing's policy support has been less aggressive than in previous downturns. With the market having already halved in value since 2021, analysts now expect the decline to continue into 2026, pushing back any hopes of a swift recovery for the critical sector.

          <p>Following the UK's decision to lift a ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors, the country's largest investment platform, Hargreaves Lansdowne, has issued a strong warning. The firm stated that Bitcoin is not considered a legitimate asset class and should not be relied upon to meet financial goals, citing its lack of intrinsic value and the impossibility of analyzing its performance assumptions. This cautious stance contrasts with other financial institutions like Morgan Stanley that are embracing digital assets, highlighting the ongoing deep division within the financial industry regarding cryptocurrency's role.

          <p>Ferrari's stock suffered its worst trading day in history, with shares plummeting over 15% after the luxury automaker announced disappointing full-year guidance and scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions. During its Capital Markets Day, the company adjusted its 2030 model lineup target to only 20% fully electric vehicles, down from a previous goal of 40%, citing a client-centric approach and evolving market conditions. The financial forecasts fell short of analyst expectations, raising concerns about the company's future growth and operating leverage, despite plans to launch its first EV in 2026.

          <p>The American trucking industry is urging Congress to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act to address a dramatic spike in online cargo theft, which has surged 1,500% since 2020. Industry experts report that sophisticated fraudsters, often based in Eastern Europe, are digitally hijacking shipments, costing the industry an estimated $19 million per day and leading to higher insurance rates. Without a dedicated federal law enforcement task force, criminals are able to steal entire truckloads of goods with little risk of prosecution, which ultimately impacts supply chains and increases consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Dina Boluarte, citing her government's perceived inability to control a severe crime wave gripping the nation. The move gained momentum after a recent shooting at a concert in Lima intensified public outrage over rising homicides and extortion. Lawmakers will now proceed with a trial, where a vote of 87 out of 130 members would be required to remove Boluarte from office, plunging the country into further political instability just two years after her predecessor was impeached.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to Steven Gerrard's recent comments that their 'golden generation' of players failed to win trophies due to being "egotistical losers." Speaking on his podcast, Rooney disagreed with the assessment, stating that while the team had big characters, their failure was not due to a poor attitude or lack of effort. He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different social dynamic and a better relationship with the media, but emphasized that his era of players worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line."</p>

          <p>Russian forces have launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine's capital, targeting critical infrastructure with ballistic missiles and drones. The assault caused power outages on the left bank of Kyiv and disruptions to the water supply, according to the city's mayor. At least nine people were injured in the capital, while officials reported that a seven-year-old child was killed in a related attack in the Zaporizhzhia region. The strikes are seen as part of a renewed Russian campaign against Ukraine's energy sites as the country heads into another winter.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing government shutdown, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has threatened to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick while being required to work without pay. Duffy described the absent employees as "problem children" responsible for a significant portion of nationwide flight delays and stated that those who do not show up for their essential duties will not receive backpay once the government reopens. The threat comes as major airports continue to experience significant disruptions due to staffing shortages, escalating the pressure on lawmakers to resolve the budget impasse.</p>

Although the reason for the flight cancellation was not immediately clear, Bray expressed suspicion that it was not a coincidence, highlighting the intense political climate and personal risks faced by academics.</p>

          <p>The victory of staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi in Japan's LDP leadership race signals a potential ideological shift away from the centrist pragmatism of recent administrations. As prime minister in waiting, her nationalist and protectionist-leaning economic policies could reshape Japan's domestic and foreign strategy. Takaichi is expected to favor state-led industrial investment, particularly in defense and technology, to reduce reliance on China. This could alter Japan's economic relationships in Asia, with investment and aid becoming more closely tied to geopolitical alignment and strategic cooperation, marking a departure from previous diplomatic approaches.</p>

After the disappointing reception of its predecessor, the development team, spanning four studios, has focused on learning from past mistakes by reintroducing a single-player campaign and incorporating fan feedback from early playtests. With a budget reportedly in the hundreds of millions, the game's success will depend on its ability to attract and retain a large player base in a highly competitive market.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at stabilizing the California FAIR Plan, the state's property insurer of last resort, which faced massive losses from recent wildfires. One key bill allows the state to issue bonds on behalf of the plan to cover catastrophic claims, while another increases legislative oversight by adding lawmakers to its governing committee. These reforms are designed to enhance the plan's financial resilience and transparency as climate-fueled fires make it increasingly difficult for homeowners in high-risk areas to obtain traditional insurance coverage.</p>
