          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples who feel like they are constantly arguing should start a "relationship bank account." This involves making "deposits" through actions that prioritize the other person's happiness, creating a sense of security and trust. A positive balance in this account helps couples handle conflicts more effectively, while a negative balance can lead to escalated fights. By identifying what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated, couples can intentionally make deposits and improve their overall relationship dynamic, leading to less frequent and less intense arguments. The key is to ensure that deposits outweigh withdrawals, fostering a healthier and more enjoyable partnership.</p>

          <p>During a hearing, Representative Betty McCollum questioned Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about the cost and resource allocation of military deployments to Los Angeles amidst ongoing immigration protests.

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing its fifth day of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, with the U.S. military activating Marines to support National Guard troops. Tensions escalated as protesters blocked freeways, set self-driving cars on fire, and clashed with law enforcement, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. California is suing the Trump administration over deploying the National Guard without consulting Governor Newsom, who called the move illegal. The protests were triggered by ICE raids in heavily Latino areas, leading to numerous arrests and widespread unrest as demonstrators decry the administration's immigration policies. The situation remains tense as authorities attempt to manage the ongoing demonstrations.</p>

          <p>CoreCivic, the largest private prison operator in the U.S., faces a lawsuit after an inmate, Matthew Vogel, was allegedly killed by his cellmate a day before his scheduled release. Vogel's family claims that cost-cutting and understaffing at the South Central Correctional Facility in Tennessee, operated by CoreCivic, contributed to the incident. The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has reestablished the use of private prison systems by federal agencies, potentially benefiting companies like CoreCivic. Audits have shown that CoreCivic prisons have higher turnover rates and staffing deficiencies compared to state-run facilities, raising concerns about inmate safety and security. Tennessee lawmakers have proposed legislation to reduce inmate populations in private prisons with high death rates, indicating increasing scrutiny of these facilities.</p>

          <p>UK companies are reducing hiring and not replacing departing workers, leading to a decrease in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest in nearly four years. This slowdown is partly attributed to an increase in National Insurance contributions paid by employers and a rise in the minimum wage, which have increased employment costs. While average wages have slowed to 5.2%, they remain above the inflation rate of 3.5%.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has stated that the government will not provide a blank check for the Sizewell C nuclear project, despite committing Â£14.2 billion to the development. He emphasized the project's potential to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade and enhance the country's energy security. The investment aims to kickstart the construction of a new nuclear plant, but the project faces opposition due to its potential cost and environmental impact. The prime minister said the plant would "bring down bills for millions of people across the country".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his government's revised policy on winter fuel payments, arguing that an improved economy has made it possible to extend the payment to more pensioners. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The Labour government had previously withdrawn the payments from all but the poorest pensioners to address the UK's financial challenges. Starmer attributed the policy shift to better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and new trade deals.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to comments they made regarding Gaza. Both ministers will be banned from entering the UK, and any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that Smotrich and Ben-Gvir had "incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights". The decision reflects growing pressure to take action against the Israeli government for its operations in Gaza and the West Bank. Israel has responded by calling the sanctions outrageous.</p>

Trump had announced Sajet's firing, citing her support for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

          <p>The debate over the two-child benefit cap in the UK intensifies, with recent estimates suggesting that scrapping the policy could lift up to 470,000 children out of poverty. The policy, implemented in 2017, limits the amount of universal credit low-income families can claim for more than two children. Prime Minister Starmer has hinted at a possible shift in the Labour government's stance, expressing a willingness to consider options for reducing child poverty. Scrapping the cap could provide eligible families with an additional Â£3,513 per year in universal credit per child, but the estimated cost to the government ranges from Â£2 billion to Â£3.5 billion.
