          <h2>Los Angeles DA Withdraws Resentencing Motion for Menendez Brothers</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is withdrawing the previous DA's motion to resentence Lyle and Erik Menendez for the murder of their parents.  Hochman cites the brothers' continued denial of responsibility and fabrication of self-defense claims.  He points to premeditation and the brothers' multiple conflicting accounts of the event.  The brothers' resentencing hearing is still scheduled for March 20 and 21, and they are pursuing other avenues for release, including a habeas corpus petition and a clemency request.</p>

          <h2>Ukraine Aid May Resume Following Saudi Arabia Meeting</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggests that the Trump administration may reinstate military and intelligence support for Ukraine if Ukrainian leaders demonstrate commitment to a peace process during a meeting in Saudi Arabia.  The initial suspension of aid was due to perceived lack of Ukrainian commitment to negotiations.  The meeting involves high-level Ukrainian officials and aims to understand Ukraine's position and willingness to make concessions.  A mineral deal is also under discussion, but is not the primary focus of the talks.  President Trump has softened his stance towards Ukraine in recent days.</p>
