          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 10:27:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explicitly stated that offshore wind energy has no future in the United States under the Trump administration, attributing this stance to the technology's high expense and insufficient reliability. This declaration provides the clearest indication yet of the administration's intention to effectively shut down the burgeoning U.S. offshore wind industry. Burgum's department is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of five offshore wind farms already under construction, some of which had previously faced stop-work orders. Industry executives are concerned that these aggressive policies targeting renewable energy could precipitate a significant power crunch and subsequently drive up electricity prices for consumers across the nation.</p>

          <p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield decreased to 4% as investors analyzed new inflation data and a rise in jobless claims, complicating the interest rate outlook. August's consumer price index saw a 0.4% monthly increase, doubling the prior month, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.9%. Despite this, a significant jump in weekly jobless claims strengthens expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut next week, with markets pricing in a high probability for a quarter-point reduction. This article highlights the tension between elevated inflation and a weakening labor market, presenting a complex challenge for monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New estimates suggest Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% to 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, potentially boosting average monthly retirement benefits by around $54. This projected increase, based on recent government inflation data, would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment that went into effect in 2025. The official COLA announcement from the Social Security Administration is typically made in October, following the inclusion of third-quarter inflation data.

          <p>The FBI has recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle, believed to be the weapon used in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities describe the attack as "targeted" and the suspect as "college-aged," with a manhunt ongoing and "good video footage" obtained. President Trump announced a posthumous Medal of Freedom for Kirk and attributed the violence to the "radical Left," while other political figures condemned the act and called for unity.

          <p>U.S. inflation accelerated in August, with the consumer price index rising 2.9% year-over-year, marking the fastest annual pace since January. Economists attribute this surge primarily to increased prices for core commodities, like clothing and household furnishings, significantly influenced by President Trump's tariff policies. Grocery prices also saw a notable rise, while disinflation among services has stalled, offering little counterbalance. The Federal Reserve faces a dilemma, potentially cutting rates to support a weakening job market, which could risk further entrenching inflation. This article provides a detailed breakdown of the persistent inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ireland's national broadcaster, RTÉ, has explicitly stated it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel's involvement proceeds, citing the "ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza." This firm stance aligns with similar threats from Slovenia and Spain, and is part of ongoing consultations within the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). RTÉ previously raised concerns about Israel's inclusion and the plight of journalists in Gaza. This article highlights the increasing politicization of cultural events due to international conflicts, reflecting a growing global tension impacting non-political spheres.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the importance of saving for future expenses and financial emergencies, strongly recommending savings accounts as a secure option. While the national average savings interest rate is a modest 0.39%, high-yield savings accounts offer significantly better returns, ranging from 4.15% to 4.35% for September 2025. Online banks are particularly noted for providing these higher rates due to their lower overhead costs, often accompanied by minimal deposit requirements and no monthly fees. This article encourages consumers to proactively compare different options to maximize their savings growth and enhance personal financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand has lifted a decades-long ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term Myanmar refugees residing in border camps. This significant policy shift comes in response to substantial cuts in humanitarian aid from the United States, which was previously the largest funder of food assistance, coupled with an influx of new refugees from Myanmar's civil war. The move aims to foster self-sufficiency among the refugees and stimulate the local economy, though concerns persist regarding their limited work skills and suitability for available jobs.

          <p>A Goldman Sachs survey reveals that ultra-wealthy family offices are increasing their allocation to public equities to 31% while reducing private equity investments to 21%. This shift reflects a "pro-risk asset mix" despite ongoing concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation, with tariffs expected to remain high. U.S. family offices, in particular, show a higher allocation to private equity than international peers, often investing opportunistically during market dislocations. The article also notes strong interest in AI investments through public equities and ETFs, and a growing use of physical gold and cryptocurrency as hedges against political instability.

          <p>U.S. median household income increased slightly to $83,730 in 2024, a 1.3% rise from the previous year, which economists consider "economically meaningful" despite not being statistically significant. However, the article highlights persistent disparities, with top earners seeing faster growth and Black households experiencing a decline in earnings. The gender wage gap also widened for full-time workers. An economist suggests that President Trump's policies, including tariffs and deportations, have contributed to a softening labor market and inflationary pressures.

          <p>CNN has recruited veteran California political reporter Elex Michaelson to lead a new two-hour live late-night newscast based in Los Angeles, set to launch in mid-October. The program aims to capitalize on West Coast prime-time viewership and the rising national profiles of California political figures like Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. Michaelson's appointment marks CNN's first L.A.-based show since 2010 and follows a previous attempt to move a Washington-based anchor to the late-night slot, which was seen as a demotion. This article signals CNN's strategic move to broaden its appeal and cover West Coast politics more extensively.</p>
