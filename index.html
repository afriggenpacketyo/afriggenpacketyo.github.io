          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has alleged that FBI agents reviewing Jeffrey Epstein's case files were told to "flag" any records mentioning Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin questioned the rationale behind this directive and the decision to withhold documents from the public, despite prior promises of a full release. The review, which involved around 1,000 personnel, has been criticized by the senator as haphazard. The FBI has declined to comment on the allegations, which add to the political pressure surrounding the handling of the Epstein investigation and its potential connections to prominent figures.</p>

          <p>The price of Ether surged following President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act, which establishes the first major U.S. law for cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin's price remained steady, Ether advanced nearly 20% for the week, with ETFs tracking the digital currency seeing record inflows. Analysts suggest this signals a potential shift in market leadership from Bitcoin to Ether, bolstered by the new regulatory clarity and increased investor confidence. The legislation is viewed as a symbolic and practical victory for the crypto industry, providing a stable legal foundation for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's dominance in the rare earth minerals market relies partly on sourcing materials from neighboring Myanmar, where ramped-up production is causing severe environmental problems downstream in Thailand. These minerals are essential for modern technology, but the mining operations are leading to pollution and ecological damage that crosses international borders. The situation highlights the hidden environmental costs associated with the global tech supply chain and the regional consequences of unchecked resource extraction. This article explores the issue from the perspective of those affected in Thailand.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States, specifically targeting stablecoins. The bipartisan legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear legal definitions for stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce volatility. Proponents argue the law will foster innovation and solidify America's leadership in digital finance, allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. The act is seen as a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation revealed that TikTok's platform makes extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos readily accessible to underage users, in violation of its own community guidelines. By creating an account for a hypothetical 15-year-old, researchers found that interacting with a few such videos prompted the algorithm to recommend more harmful content, including pro-anorexia messages and diets well below healthy caloric intakes. While TikTok states it works to remove such content and provide support resources, critics argue the platform's systems are failing to protect vulnerable young users from potentially dangerous material promoting disordered eating and negative body image.</p>

However, the downturn was partially offset by a significant 12.5% increase in visitors from Mexico during the same period.

          <p>A multi-vehicle crash on an interstate in San Antonio has left four people dead and sixteen others injured. According to police, the incident occurred when a speeding stolen Camaro struck a trailer being towed by a bus, causing the bus driver to lose control. The bus then hit a guardrail and was subsequently struck by a tractor-trailer, causing it to roll over and eject several passengers. Police Chief William McManus stated that the occupants of the stolen Camaro fled the scene on foot without rendering aid and have not yet been identified or located.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account would currently earn more interest on a $20,000 deposit. While money market accounts offer slightly higher variable rates at present, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return over a set term. Calculations show that a money market account would yield more if current rates hold, but this is unlikely given potential future rate cuts. Therefore, the article suggests that a long-term CD might be the safer and ultimately more lucrative option for savers prioritizing guaranteed returns over liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from The Wall Street Journal has renewed focus on the long-standing relationship between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, detailing a "bawdy" message in a 2003 birthday book for Epstein. This article provides context, outlining their frequent socializing in New York and Palm Beach from the late 1980s until a reported falling-out in 2004 over a real estate deal. While Trump has denied the authenticity of the birthday book message, it adds another layer to their well-documented friendship, which included Trump's 2002 praise of Epstein as a "terrific guy" who liked women "on the younger side."</p>

          <p>Shares of Texas Roadhouse have recently underperformed the market, partly due to concerns over accelerating beef inflation, a key cost for the steakhouse chain. Beef prices rose about 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, putting pressure on the company's operating margins. Despite this, some analysts remain optimistic, raising their price targets and citing the company's strong traffic trends and continued market share gains in the full-service dining sector. The long-term outlook is viewed as positive, even though short-term commodity price challenges are expected to persist until cattle inventories rebuild. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, Powell has indicated that the Fed is holding rates steady due to inflation risks exacerbated by the administration's tariff policies.

Her new book argues that the story of their murder was Tudor propaganda. While the claim has been met with skepticism from some historians, Langley asserts that her research shifts the burden of proof to those who maintain the traditional account.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has imposed a new 93.5% anti-dumping duty on certain graphite imports from China, a critical material for electric vehicle batteries.

The move targets China's dominance in the global graphite market, where it accounts for about 75% of production. While the tariffs are expected to increase battery production costs for automakers, some analysts believe the overall impact on consumer EV prices will be limited.

Critics, including Democratic senators and aid organizations, have condemned the move as a waste of taxpayer money and an abdication of U.S. leadership in global health.
