          <p>During a Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, a fan fell from the right-field bleachers onto the warning track, prompting an immediate response from trainers and police. The incident occurred shortly after an RBI double by the Pirates' Andrew McCutchen, leading to a roughly 10-minute delay as players offered prayers and knelt in concern. The fan was carted off the field on a backboard, and their condition was not immediately disclosed. Another fan assisted the injured individual immediately after the fall. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans might have to "do with less" due to the ongoing trade war with China, marking a shift from his previous assurances of minimal disruption. He suggested that while shelves would remain stocked, consumers might have fewer choices or pay slightly more for goods. Trump maintained that China would suffer more, emphasizing that the U.S. doesn't need many of the imported goods, portraying the trade war as a necessary step to rectify unfair trade practices. Trump said that he will speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping soon about the trade war.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is working to return approximately 500 firearms recovered from the aftermath of the Palisades Fire, which burned over 23,000 acres earlier in the year. The LAPD is asking individuals who believe they lost a firearm in the fire to contact the department’s Gun Recovery Unit by email. Many of the guns sustained severe fire damage, making them difficult to identify. The Palisades Fire, along with the Eaton Fire, caused significant damage and economic losses, estimated at over $250 billion, and resulted in 28 deaths and the destruction of over 16,000 structures.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared divided during arguments regarding the creation of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma, which could become the nation's first religious charter school. Justices Alito and Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to the school's argument that excluding it from the charter system is discriminatory, while liberal justices expressed concerns about weakening the separation of church and state. A ruling in favor of the school could impact laws in numerous states and the federal charter school program, potentially allowing public funds to flow directly to religious schools for religious activities.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert in China, Qi Xiangdong, cautioned against over-reliance on artificial intelligence for decision-making, citing potential security vulnerabilities. He noted that hackers could exploit AI systems or manipulate data to influence outcomes, and erroneous information could contaminate AI learning environments. This warning comes amidst growing enthusiasm for China's AI chatbot, DeepSeek, which has garnered widespread support from both the public and government agencies. Beijing has hailed DeepSeek as a success in the face of Western sanctions limiting China's access to high-tech chips.</p>

          <p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has indicated that certification for China's C919 passenger plane will not be granted in 2025, potentially delaying its entry into the European market. EASA's executive director, Florian Guillermet, stated that certification is expected within three to six years, requiring more time to prove the aircraft's reliability and safety. Despite this setback, analysts anticipate that the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) will continue its efforts to expand the C919's presence in overseas markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it has already transported over 1 million passengers on domestic routes since its first commercial flight in May 2023.</p>

Apple is now required to allow developers to bypass its in-app payment tool without incurring commissions, potentially impacting the App Store's multibillion-dollar revenue.

          <p>Ukraine and the US have signed a deal pushed by President Donald Trump that will give the US preferential access to Ukrainian mineral resources and fund investment in Ukraine’s reconstruction. The accord establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine. After fraught negotiations, which almost collapsed at the last minute, the agreement is central to Kyiv’s efforts to mend ties with Trump and the White House, which frayed after he took office in January.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement that allows the U.S. to share in future revenues from Ukraine's mineral reserves, aiming to fund the country's rebuilding after its conflict with Russia.

          <p>Alibaba's cloud computing unit has unveiled its Qwen3 family of AI models, featuring eight enhanced models ranging from 600 million to 235 billion parameters. Analysts suggest that these models demonstrate Chinese companies have significantly closed the technology gap with US firms. Despite US export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, innovation is expected to continue, with growing availability of alternative AI chips from domestic suppliers like Huawei Technologies and Cambricon Technologies.</p>

          <p>Hospitality workers in Las Vegas are still awaiting the fulfillment of President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, which constitute a significant portion of their income. Despite two bills working their way through Congress, no legislation has yet been enacted. Union leaders are calling for real action rather than promises, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests revenue from tariffs could fund the plan. Workers like Sebastian Espinoza emphasize that eliminating federal taxes on tips would provide much-needed financial relief amidst rising inflation.</p>

          <p>A report indicating that the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter of 2025 has underscored the economic risks associated with President Trump's aggressive trade policies. The contraction, coupled with a decline in stock prices, has raised concerns about the potential for an extended slowdown or recession. While Trump maintains that his trade deals will revitalize manufacturing, the first-quarter figures have intensified political pressure and raised questions about his economic competence. Some advisors acknowledge the timing of tariff announcements may have been a mistake, leading to uncertainty among businesses and consumers.</p>

Officials emphasize that feeding and approaching wildlife is illegal and advise maintaining a safe distance. Mule deer also tend to gather near vegetation near roads, especially at dawn and dusk, necessitating careful driving within the park.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a sharp slowdown in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate. This decline is attributed to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The slowdown has fueled concerns that Trump's trade measures could disrupt the U.S. economy and increase the likelihood of a recession. However, some economists believe the figures may be skewed due to the surge in imports, and demand from consumers and businesses remains resilient.</p>
