          <p>At least 37 people have been killed and about 50 wounded in southern Syria following clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and the Druze community in the city of Sweida. The violence, which included the deaths of two children, reportedly erupted after a series of kidnappings, highlighting the fragile security situation in the country. This recent fighting is the deadliest since similar clashes in April and May, forcing the closure of a major highway and the postponement of school exams. The new government has struggled to maintain order and protect minority rights since the overthrow of Bashar Assad's regime.</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by strengthening its defense ties with the Philippines while managing its crucial trade relationship with China. As part of a broader maritime cooperation program, Australia has donated equipment and plans to double its investment in related initiatives to A$11.5 million by 2029. This move reflects an expanding strategic partnership as the two nations approach their 80th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2026. Analysts note that both countries are motivated to enhance their alliance, which includes cooperation on marine protection, operational training, and maritime law, amid regional tensions.</p>

          <h2>Technology and Engineering Fields Become Top Priority for Chinese Students</h2>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly prioritizing technology-focused majors like information technology and vehicle engineering. This trend marks a departure from two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were popular, reflecting China's economic boom and entry into the WTO. Now, amid intensified tech competition with the United States, the state-driven system is funneling students into engineering disciplines. This strategic focus aims to bolster China's industrial development and secure its position in future technological advancements, reshaping the country's academic landscape and workforce.</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have climbed to their highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 people in 2024-25. In addition to prosecutions, TfL issued over 13,000 penalty fare notices on the Tube and a record number on the London Overground. TfL states that fare evasion costs Londoners vital investment and has committed to reducing the evasion rate to 1.5% by 2030. The transport body spent nearly £14.2 million on cracking down on Tube fare dodging last year, employing over 500 uniformed officers to tackle the issue.</p>

          <p>Emergency crews in Kerr County, Texas, have suspended search operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flash floods due to a new flood threat. Heavy weekend rains have caused the San Saba and Guadalupe rivers to rise again, prompting new evacuations and rescue operations in several counties. At least 161 people remain missing from the initial disaster, which killed over 100 people, including dozens of children at a summer camp. Authorities have issued urgent warnings for residents to avoid the river corridors, describing the situation as dangerous and life-threatening.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory is marking a major milestone, celebrating 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation, the longest such record in the UK and Ireland. Since July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded temperature and air pressure, creating an invaluable climate dataset. This tradition continues today, with a human observer still logging data by hand, providing a unique contrast to modern automated stations. The records have captured significant meteorological events, from major storms to the first observations of noctilucent clouds, and have contributed to the development of meteorology, including the invention of the four-cup anemometer.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following an announcement of plans to sell U.S. weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This move comes as Ukraine faces intense air assaults from Russia and the Trump administration considers sending more defensive weapons, including Patriot missiles. Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are also meeting with Rutte, promoting a legislative package that would impose heavy tariffs on countries supporting Russia's economy. The plan aims to provide faster military aid to Ukraine by transferring existing weapons from European allies, who would then purchase replacements from the U.S.</p>

The SBU stated the agents were killed after resisting arrest and had been surveilling the colonel to learn his daily routines. This event occurs amidst the ongoing war, where Russia launched another 60 drones into Ukraine overnight.

The country is warming at a rate of 0.25C per decade, leading to more hot days, fewer frosts, and wetter winters.

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some conservative leaders globally, is facing a significant political challenge at home. While his playbook of targeting liberal values has been effective for years, a new opposition figure, Peter Magyar, has emerged from Orban's own circle. Magyar is gaining traction by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of hospitals and schools. This shift in opposition strategy, moving from the liberal left to the center-right, combined with economic stagnation, suggests Orban's long-standing power may be weakening ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

This defense comes despite the U.S. having a trade surplus with Brazil, a point raised by critics.

          <p>A Senate committee report has blamed the U.S. Secret Service for a "cascade of preventable failures" leading to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last summer. The report from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee highlights a lack of structured communication as a primary contributor to the security breakdown. Key information about a suspicious person was not effectively relayed to Trump's security detail in time. The report also found that a countersniper team had an obstructed view and that the agency had denied resources to the detail, contradicting previous testimony from the former director.</p>
