          <p>A Los Angeles judge has set a hearing for May 13 and 14 to determine if Lyle and Erik Menendez are eligible for release after being imprisoned for over three decades for the shotgun murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1990. The hearing follows years of legal battles and renewed interest in the case due to recent Netflix shows and social media campaigns that highlight the brothers' claims of sexual assault by their father, which they argue should have been considered a mitigating factor at trial. District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes resentencing, while a report on the brothers' prison conduct is under review by Governor Gavin Newsom. The brothers maintain they acted in self-defense, a claim Hochman disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, which is the constitutional right to challenge the legality of detention in court. This consideration arises amid pending civil cases challenging the administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants. Miller indicated that President Trump's decision hinges on whether courts block the administration's deportation efforts. The use of the word "invasion" by Miller reflects the administration's argument that the U.S. faces an "invasion" of undocumented migrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York is set to lower the minimum hiring age for prison guards from 21 to 18 in response to a correction officer shortage exacerbated by the firing of over 2,000 guards who participated in a strike protesting poor working conditions. The measure, approved by state lawmakers, includes restrictions on younger guards, such as prohibiting them from carrying firearms or transporting inmates unsupervised. The strike followed the high-profile fatal beating of Robert Brooks at an upstate New York prison, leading to charges against multiple individuals. The state corrections commissioner has also been directed to begin releasing some inmates early due to the shortage of guards.</p>

          <p>Several USAID employees who spoke to reporters after receiving notices of termination from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are now facing internal investigations for unauthorized media engagement. The employees received emails accusing them of engaging with the press without authorization, potentially leading to disciplinary action. The American Foreign Service Association has condemned the inquiries as intimidation, asserting that federal employees retain constitutional rights. This situation follows drastic personnel cuts at USAID overseen by Elon Musk's DOGE, which has faced challenges in executing terminations and has prompted concerns about stifling criticism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that GLP-1 medications, commonly used for weight loss and diabetes, may also help heavy drinkers reduce their alcohol consumption by nearly 70%. The study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity, found that these drugs, like semaglutide and liraglutide, were more effective than nalmefene, a drug specifically approved for reducing alcohol intake. Researchers believe that GLP-1 drugs may affect brain chemicals tied to pleasure and fullness, thus reducing cravings for alcohol. Participants in the study also experienced an average weight loss of 17 pounds over four months, though the study lacked a control group and relied on self-reported drinking habits.</p>

          <p>Speculation arose about a potential summit between Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, and Vladimir Putin to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, reminiscent of the Yalta Conference. However, the meeting did not occur, with Xi and Putin meeting in Moscow while Trump was absent. In a joint statement, Xi and Putin pledged to enhance cooperation and counter what they view as Washington's attempts at 'dual containment' of their countries. Analysts suggest there is little prospect for meaningful cooperation between the US, China, and Russia in addressing global challenges, such as the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a highly contagious liver infection, with cases remaining unusually high in 2025. The virus is spread through the oral-fecal route, often affecting unhoused individuals and travelers to areas with poor sanitation, though recent cases have occurred in people without these risk factors. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea, and yellowed skin and eyes, with severe symptoms more common in older adults and those with weakened immune systems. The best way to prevent infection is through vaccination, and officials emphasize the need to reassess prevention efforts.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the Tyre Nichols case, where despite video evidence of a savage beating by Memphis police officers, three of the officers were acquitted on serious charges. The author argues that this outcome reveals the limitations of police reform efforts and the difficulty of securing murder convictions against officers. The changing political climate and rising violent crime have further stalled the movement toward broader reform, both locally and nationally. The author concludes that the failure to secure murder convictions and bring greater accountability means that Nichols will not be the last to suffer an unjust death.</p>

          <p>Cities are using local laws to challenge the establishment of immigrant detention centers, citing concerns over conditions and community impact. In Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested during a protest outside an ICE facility, highlighting the city's opposition to the center. Similarly, in Leavenworth, Kansas, the city is arguing that CoreCivic needs to follow a formal process before reopening a former prison as a detention center. Advocates raise concerns about overcrowding and inhumane conditions in ICE detention centers, emphasizing the need for proper oversight and humane treatment of detainees.</p>

          <p>Fifteen states, largely Democratic, are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to fast-track energy projects, claiming the administration is bypassing environmental protection laws. The lawsuit challenges President Trump's executive order declaring a "national energy emergency" and alleges that agencies are circumventing required reviews under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The states argue that this improper permitting process will cause significant harm to natural resources and the people who rely on them. The White House defends the executive order, asserting the president's authority to determine what constitutes a national emergency.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. have plunged in April following the imposition of steep tariffs, leading U.S. retailers to cancel orders. The tariffs, which reached up to 145%, have significantly increased the cost of importing goods from China. Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries have surged by the same amount, demonstrating how President Trump's tariffs are already upending trade patterns. President Trump suggested the levies on China could come down to 80%, but even this lower rate would still make importing goods from China prohibitively expensive for many U.S.-based businesses.</p>

This baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, is higher than the effective tariff rate prior to the second Trump administration.
