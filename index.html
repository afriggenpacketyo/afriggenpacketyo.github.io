          <p>The Trump administration is rapidly resettling white Afrikaners from South Africa as refugees, citing racial persecution, a move that contrasts sharply with the near-shutdown of other refugee admissions. Government officials are planning a welcome event at Dulles Airport for the arriving Afrikaners, a white minority group claiming job discrimination and safety concerns. South Africa disputes the refugee status claims, calling the U.S. actions politically motivated and not meeting international legal standards. The resettlement is funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, raising concerns about prioritization over other refugees awaiting processing for years.</p>

          <p>A five-year-old grizzly bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058, died in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park after being hit by a vehicle, mirroring the death of his famous mother, Grizzly No. 399, last year. Park rangers discovered the bear's body near Highway 26, noting he may have been dead for several days. The National Park Service is reminding visitors to drive cautiously, be vigilant, and avoid distractions, as wildlife is often near roadways and can unexpectedly cross the road. Between 2009 and 2023, 49 grizzly bears died due to vehicle collisions, highlighting the dangers wildlife faces near park roads.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly pushing for tax hikes on individuals making $2.5 million or more to help pass his "big, beautiful bill" by Memorial Day. This move aims to offset potential revenue losses from politically popular tax cuts, such as eliminating taxes on tips. However, many conservatives have historically opposed any tax increases. Trump acknowledged the political challenges but indicated he would be okay with Republicans raising taxes on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers.</p>

          <p>New tariffs imposed on Chinese imports are posing an existential threat to immigrant-run businesses in historic Chinatowns across the United States. Shop owners, already struggling since the pandemic's onset, face rising costs and declining demand, exacerbating their financial difficulties. The tariffs impact a wide range of goods, from herbal medicines to jewelry and antiques, forcing businesses to raise prices or seek alternative, more expensive suppliers. These challenges add to existing pressures, such as gentrification and anti-Asian sentiment, further shrinking economic opportunities for working-class Asian immigrants.</p>

          <p>Despite calls from some liberals, focusing on climate change may not be the best strategy for Democrats to win back voters who supported Trump. Polls indicate that climate change ranks low among voters' priorities, including young voters, with the economy and jobs being more pressing concerns. While Democrats have emphasized climate action, it hasn't translated into increased voter support, and voters already recognize the party's commitment to the issue. Prioritizing climate change risks alienating voters more concerned with cost of living and economic issues, potentially undermining Democrats' credibility on these bread-and-butter topics.</p>

For those with mixed debt, debt relief experts can negotiate settlements or enroll individuals in debt management plans. Bankruptcy is a last resort.

Executives from various social media companies have struggled to define the industry's market, highlighting the evolving and complex nature of social networking.

          <p>After receiving his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, Warriors player Draymond Green expressed his frustration with what he perceived as an "agenda" to portray him as an "angry Black man". He stated that he is a successful, educated Black man with a great family, and is great at basketball and great at what he does. Green's comments followed a game where he was involved in an incident with Naz Reid, and a fan was ejected for directing a racial slur at Green. Teammate Jimmy Butler agreed that Green's reputation often leads to calls going against him.</p>

The current district attorney opposes resentencing, reversing the previous district attorney's position. The defense argues the brothers won't receive a fair hearing due to the current prosecutor's bias and mistreatment of the Menendez family. California's attorney general is siding with the current district attorney, making a recusal unlikely. A final hearing is scheduled for June 13, influencing whether the governor grants the brothers clemency.</p>
