          <p>Meta is heavily investing in AI, particularly its Llama models, but investors are keen to see a return on these significant expenditures, especially given potential impacts from President Trump's tariff policies. Analysts are closely watching Meta's LlamaCon event and upcoming earnings report for signs that AI investments are translating into tangible business benefits. While Meta is expected to maintain its $60-$65 billion capex guidance for AI infrastructure, tariffs could introduce upward cost revisions and impact the timing of spending. Meta needs to demonstrate that Llama can generate revenue, differentiating it from Google's more direct monetization approach.</p>

          <p>A letter written by Titanic first-class passenger Archibald Gracie just days before the ship sank sold for $399,000 at auction. In the letter, Gracie prophetically wrote, "It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her." Gracie survived the sinking and later wrote a detailed account of the disaster. The letter, postmarked from Queenstown, Ireland, is considered a rare and significant historical artifact, offering a personal glimpse into the thoughts of a passenger just before the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) training programs, designed to prepare students for jobs in the burgeoning EV industry, face uncertainty due to policy shifts under President Trump. His administration's efforts to roll back EV incentives and regulations threaten to dampen demand for electric vehicles, potentially jeopardizing investments in training programs and the economic prospects of states like Kansas. Despite the federal policy changes, some local leaders and community colleges remain optimistic about the long-term viability of the EV industry and the value of the skills being taught.</p>
