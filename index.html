          <h2>Walmart CFO Warns of Potential Price Hikes Due to Tariffs Despite Earnings Beat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey indicated that consumers may soon see price increases due to tariffs, despite the company's efforts to maintain everyday low prices. The retailer beat quarterly earnings estimates, posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, but acknowledged that the magnitude of tariff increases is too significant for retailers and suppliers to absorb. While Walmart expects net sales to increase, it declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy, but it is unlikely they will be able to absorb all of the costs. </p>

          <p>The UK economy has demonstrated surprising resilience, exceeding expectations with a growth rate of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, according to an article by Faisal Islam. This performance challenges earlier predictions of a recession, though millions of families and small businesses still face cost-of-living pressures. The impact of potential interest rate cuts and relative political stability may be more significant than initially thought, with real incomes rising and businesses accommodating increased National Insurance contributions through profit margin adjustments. While a slowdown is anticipated in the current quarter, the initial growth figures have shifted the perception of the UK economy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals a growing shortage of affordable homes for middle-income families, with only about 1 in 5 listed homes being affordable for households earning $75,000 annually. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach, particularly in cities with zoning restrictions that hinder new construction. The lack of affordable homes is driving up prices further, as buyers compete for limited properties, however some cities are showing improvements in affordable listings, signaling a potential shift. Innovative housing solutions and policy changes could help alleviate the affordability crunch. </p>

          <p>During a speech in Saudi Arabia, President Trump denounced Western intervention and nation-building, eliciting applause from the audience. He criticized past American policies in the Middle East, particularly the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, and urged the region to chart its own course. Trump expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and to reach a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and he met with the new leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist. The remarks sparked varied reactions, with some viewing it as a positive shift away from interventionism and others expressing concern about the potential impact on human rights. </p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changing economic conditions and policy uncertainties. He suggested the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, citing the potential for more frequent and persistent supply shocks. While Powell did not directly address President Trump's tariffs, he noted they could slow growth and boost inflation, creating a difficult balancing act for the Fed.

          <p>Bella Culley, an 18-year-old from Billingham, UK, could spend up to nine months in a Georgian prison while authorities investigate her on suspicion of drug offenses. Culley was arrested in Tbilisi and charged with importing large quantities of narcotics, and the prosecution has requested 55 days to gather evidence before trial, which could be extended. During a pre-trial hearing, Culley informed the court that she is pregnant, and her lawyer stated that police are seeking to determine the source of the narcotics and whether she intended to distribute them. The British consular service is providing support to Culley's family. </p>

          <p>Mali's military government has banned all political parties and political organizations, sparking concerns about the country's democratic future. The move follows an increasing number of pro-democracy activists being kidnapped and a delayed election, originally planned for February 2024. Analysts warn that this is a dramatic setback for democracy in Mali, which has a long history of elected government. While it remains uncertain whether this is a short-term measure or a permanent shift, there is hope that Malians will eventually reject the complete shutdown of democratic expression. </p>

          <p>Walmart has announced plans to raise prices as early as this month in response to increasing costs resulting from tariffs on imports imposed by President Trump. Despite efforts to keep prices low, the magnitude of the tariffs, even at reduced levels, makes it impossible for Walmart to absorb all the pressure. The company is preparing to adjust its purchasing strategies if shoppers resist higher prices, but uncertainty surrounding trade policy has led Walmart to withhold guidance on sales and profit expectations for the next three months. </p>

While Walmart will try to mitigate the impact on consumers, the retailer has withdrawn its quarterly profit outlook due to global economic uncertainty.

While Reeves acknowledged the ongoing cost of living crisis, she emphasized that the numbers indicate progress, though Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was "a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks". </p>

The union representing the workers argues that the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining and that the company should focus on more important issues, such as improving working conditions. Starbucks maintains that the new rules will make its green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers as it tries to establish a warmer, more welcoming feeling in its stores, and that the strike is having a limited impact on its operations. </p>
