          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining current foreign students by revoking its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited "pro-terrorist conduct" and accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, while Harvard called the action unlawful and retaliatory, threatening serious harm to the university's community and academic mission. This decision follows previous actions, including freezing federal grants, due to concerns about antisemitism and ideological issues on campus, impacting over 27% of Harvard's student body. The university is working to provide guidance and support to its international students and scholars.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has warned about the ballooning U.S. deficit, suggesting investors should be wary of the government bond market. He believes the deficit is unsustainable and exceeds what the market can bear, estimating it at about 6.5% of GDP. Rising financing costs, increased spending, and declining tax receipts have pushed the national debt past $36 trillion, with interest payments now a significant government expense. Dalio is not optimistic about politicians resolving these issues due to partisan divisions that lead to increased spending and deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed the No Tax on Tips Act, which would eliminate federal taxes on service and hospitality workers' tips, but critics argue this policy primarily benefits businesses and could cost the government billions in tax revenue. They contend that the real issue is the subminimum wage for tipped workers, which incentivizes businesses to lower base wages and rely on tips. Eliminating the subminimum wage and raising the minimum wage would be more effective solutions, as many tipped workers already earn so little they are exempt from income taxes. A higher minimum wage for all workers would provide more financial stability and reduce poverty among tipped employees.</p>

          <p>A White House report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blames a crisis of chronic illness in children on ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive prescription drug use. The report criticizes corporate influence in policymaking and insufficient investment in understanding disease causes and prevention. While echoing many of Kennedy's views, including concerns about vaccine safety and environmental toxins, the report also acknowledges the benefits of vaccines in protecting children from infectious diseases.

          <p>Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict an above-average number of storms during the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season, with 13 to 19 named storms expected. Of those, 6 are expected to become hurricanes, and 3 to 5 are forecast to be major hurricanes. Climate change contributes to the increased frequency and intensity of storms, with abnormally warm ocean temperatures and a warmer atmosphere capable of holding more moisture. Residents in coastal and inland areas are urged to prepare for potential flooding, storm surge, and wind damage.</p>

The order bars the government from arresting or incarcerating the plaintiffs and similarly situated students, from transferring any of them outside the jurisdiction of their residence, from imposing any adverse legal effect on students and from reversing the reinstatement of the legal status until the case is resolved. Students can still be arrested for violent crimes. White said the government’s actions “wreaked havoc not only on the lives of Plaintiffs here but on similarly situated F-1 nonimmigrants across the United States and continues do so.”</p>

The document echoes talking points Health Secretary Robert F.

Experts note that testosterone is important for women's mood, energy, and bone health, but research is limited. Although there are currently no Health Canada approved testosterone medications for women in Canada and no federally approved testosterone drugs for women in the U.S., Jacobson said healthcare providers can repurpose and prescribe testosterone medications that are approved for men at much lower doses.</p>

In a tie, the court split 4 to 4 over the Oklahoma plan, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recusing herself from the case, and the decision provided no reasoning.The question is likely to come before the court again in the coming years, giving the justices the opportunity to weigh in again in a more definitive way.</p>
