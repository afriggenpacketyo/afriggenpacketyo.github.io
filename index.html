          <h2>National Weather Service Faces Staffing Shortages at Start of Hurricane Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 09:20:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Weather Service is entering hurricane season with significant staffing gaps due to budget cuts and hiring freezes. Meteorologists are concerned that these shortages could impact the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts, potentially endangering communities. Several forecast offices are critically understaffed, leading to limited hours and suspended weather balloon launches. The agency is trying to redistribute staff, but experts worry about burnout and the potential for errors during periods of intense storm activity, as the agency is currently operating with approximately 10% less staff than before the cuts. Optimism regarding the agency's capacity to perform effectively is tempered by the challenges posed by resource constraints.</p>

          <p>At least 27 Palestinians were killed and 161 wounded while attempting to access food at a Gaza distribution center run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reported the incident, marking the third day of deadly violence near GHF hubs, which the UN has accused of weaponizing aid. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots after identifying suspects deviating from designated routes. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called the situation "unconscionable" and demanded an investigation, raising concerns about the militarized nature of aid distribution and the potential for war crimes.</p>

This "NATO first" policy will focus on immediate threats to Europe but also addresses Indo-Pacific security through the AUKUS partnership. The U.K. aims to increase defense spending to 3% of GDP by 2030 and take a leadership role within NATO, particularly given questions about U.S. reliability.</p>

The OECD attributes the slowdown primarily to the Trump administration's tariffs, which have increased the effective tariff rate to 15.4%. These tariffs are expected to cause inflation to spike, reaching 3.9% by the end of 2025, as costs are passed onto consumers.
