        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Donald Trump's description of Vladimir Putin as "absolutely crazy" after a large Russian aerial assault on Ukraine, the Kremlin responded by suggesting Trump was experiencing "emotional overload." Trump's comments came after Russia's extensive drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, resulting in numerous casualties. Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, stated that Ukraine's allies had removed range limits on supplied arms, potentially allowing Ukraine to strike military positions within Russia. The German Chancellor's announcement is in response to the Russian attacks over the weekend, which have intensified since the start of the war.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commemorated Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery, delivering remarks that included a veiled critique of the previous administration's policies. Speaking at the Tomb of the Unknowns, Trump honored fallen soldiers while also touching on political themes, referencing border security and his efforts to "fix" the nation. He also highlighted upcoming events like the military parade for America's 250th birthday, the 2026 World Cup, and the 2028 Olympics. The president's remarks followed earlier social media posts where he both commemorated the holiday and criticized political opponents.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic discusses the recent shooting in Washington, D.C., where two Israeli Embassy aides were murdered, allegedly by an individual affiliated with a socialist group. The authors argue that this incident is symptomatic of a broader issue of rising anti-Semitism and political violence in America, fueled by extremist ideologies. They criticize elite institutions for indulging identity politics and failing to uphold civic norms, arguing that the denial of Jewish legitimacy has become increasingly normalized. The article calls for a reaffirmation that no political grievance justifies murder and for a defense of civic order.</p>

          <p>Spain has called for a European arms embargo on Israel amid escalating violence in Gaza, but the effectiveness of such a measure hinges on action from key weapons exporters. The United States and Germany are the primary suppliers of arms to Israel, accounting for a significant portion of its military imports. While some EU nations have reduced or suspended arms exports, a comprehensive embargo would require the involvement of the U.S. and Germany, which is unlikely given their long-standing support for Israel's security. The article explores the complexities of arms supply and the political considerations influencing international policy.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are expressing hope for a swift resolution to the trade war with the U.S. after President Trump delayed the imposition of 50% tariffs until July 9. The delay followed a call between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to fast-track negotiations. Despite the delay, uncertainty remains for businesses, and existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place. The EU is considering further retaliatory tariffs targeting a wide range of U.S. goods if a deal is not reached.</p>

This decision allows Ukraine to defend itself by attacking military positions within Russia, marking a significant shift in policy. The Kremlin responded that lifting range restrictions would be "quite dangerous" and hinder efforts for a political settlement. Germany has been a major provider of military aid to Ukraine, though the provision of Taurus long-range cruise missiles remains under consideration.</p>
