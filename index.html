          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 17:21:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary trial of the experimental gene therapy AMT-130 has demonstrated a remarkable 75% reduction in Huntington's disease progression over three years for patients receiving a high dose. Developed by University College London, this one-time treatment works by using a harmless virus to deliver genetic instructions that turn off harmful proteins in the brain. While these early results are highly encouraging, with one patient even returning to work, larger studies are still required. The treatment offers significant hope as the first designed to actively slow the disease rather than just manage symptoms, though FDA approval is years away.</p>

          <p>Emergency services are responding to a serious explosion and large blaze at the ESP Smile printing business warehouse in Swindon, England. Police, ambulance crews, and ten fire engines established a large cordon and evacuated nearby buildings on the Groundwell Industrial Estate after the incident, which occurred around 19:30 BST. Local residents reported feeling their homes shake, and a power cut impacted 77 properties, which was due to a safety concern on the network. A fire investigation officer is at the scene, with inquiries into the cause set to begin once it is safe to do so.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is reportedly expected to face criminal indictment in federal court in Virginia within days, according to MSNBC. This development follows the resignation of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who reportedly opposed filing charges against Comey, and the subsequent appointment of Lindsey Halligan, an interim U.S. Attorney who has represented Donald Trump. The potential charges are believed to include lying to Congress during his September 2020 testimony about authorizing an information leak to The Wall Street Journal, with the five-year statute of limitations expiring next Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is projected to move northwestward, with steady strengthening anticipated over the coming days due to favorable environmental conditions. As of the National Hurricane Center's update, Humberto is located about 550 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands, moving at 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, extending outward up to 45 miles. While it is one of two systems swirling in the western Atlantic, currently there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect. However, some downstream impacts could potentially affect parts of the Southeast U.S. coast from Florida up to North Carolina.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, which killed one detainee and injured two others, has sparked sharply divided political reactions across the U.S. Republicans, including Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, swiftly blamed the 'radical left' and 'anti-ICE rhetoric,' framing it as an attack on law enforcement. Conversely, Democrats focused on the victims, pushing for gun control and rejecting anti-immigrant sentiment, criticizing officials for politicizing the event and overlooking the detainees' identities.

          <p>A shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas resulted in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others, with the gunman dying from a self-inflicted wound. Law enforcement officials recovered unused ammunition casings at the scene inscribed with 'ANTI-ICE' messages, prompting FBI Director Kash Patel to post a photo and suggest an ideological motive behind the attack. This incident is the latest in a string of attacks on ICE facilities, occurring as the agency intensifies efforts for mass deportations. Officials, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz, condemned politically motivated violence, urging an end to divisive rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump violated the Inspector General Act by firing eight government watchdogs without notifying Congress or providing specific reasons for their removal. Despite this, the judge declined to reinstate the officials, arguing they failed to show irreparable harm and that Trump could legally remove them again within 30 days by complying with federal law. The inspectors general, tasked with investigating fraud and waste across eight agencies, were informed of their firings via email citing 'changing priorities.'

          <p>Donald Trump's recently appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to ask a grand jury to indict former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress.

Halligan, who has no prior criminal prosecution experience and was Trump's former personal attorney, is proceeding with the grand jury presentation before the statute of limitations expires next week.

          <p>Lawyers representing the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, 32, who died after riding Universal Orlando Resort's Stardust Racers roller coaster, assert his spinal disability played no role in his death. They believe he suffered fatal blunt force trauma from repeatedly hitting his head on a restraint during the ride's downward thrusts, causing him to be unconscious for most of it. The family's attorneys dispute Universal's claim that 'internal findings' showed the ride functioned normally, arguing that proper function doesn't rule out safety issues. The medical examiner ruled the death an accident due to multiple blunt impact injuries, and the coaster remains closed for review.</p>

          <p>This article outlines critical mistakes borrowers often make when trying to pay off debt, emphasizing that good intentions alone are insufficient. Key pitfalls include only making minimum payments, which prolongs debt and increases interest costs, and taking on new debt while repaying old balances, which can quickly erase progress. It also advises against draining emergency funds, ignoring available professional help like credit counseling or balance transfers, and failing to adjust spending habits. The article stresses the importance of acting promptly, as delaying action allows interest to compound rapidly and makes debt more expensive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the fall respiratory season approaches, confusion surrounds recommendations for children's flu and COVID-19 vaccinations due to shifting guidance. While the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) consistently advise flu shots for children 6 months and older, advice for COVID-19 vaccines varies significantly. The CDC suggests parents discuss benefits with a provider for healthy children, but the AAP strongly recommends shots for ages 6 months to 2 years. This article notes other medical groups and state alliances also have differing recommendations, partly influenced by recent changes to the CDC's advisory committee.</p>

          <p>Two e-commerce entrepreneurs, Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), are accused by the SEC of running a $112 million Ponzi scheme. They acquired well-known bankrupt brands like RadioShack and Pier 1 Imports, allegedly making false claims to investors about the companies' profitability and strong cash flow. The SEC claims that none of the portfolio companies generated profits, and returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors or inter-company transfers. The suit alleges $16 million of investments was also allocated for their personal use. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's political thriller, 'One Battle After Another,' is reviewed as an invigorating adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 'Vineland,' reimagining its themes of rebellion and societal struggle. The article praises Teyana Taylor's powerful performance as revolutionary leader Perfidia Beverly Hills, contrasting it with Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of her 'pathetic' lover, Bob. The film, which reorients the story around race, explores the relentless, multi-faceted fight against oppression and highlights the impersonal nature of state violence. It ultimately suggests that the fight for liberation is a continuous, collective effort, with others always taking over from the fallen.</p>

          <p>This article explores various structured approaches to efficiently pay off multiple debts, a challenge exacerbated by high interest rates and inflation. It details the 'debt snowball' method, which prioritizes paying off the smallest balance first for psychological motivation, and the 'debt avalanche' method, which targets the highest interest rate debt to save money. Other strategies include using balance transfer credit cards with 0% introductory APRs, consolidating debts with a loan, implementing a debt management plan through credit counseling, or considering debt settlement for severe hardship. Consistency is highlighted as the most important factor in any debt payoff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve initiating interest rate cuts, homeowners are comparing the costs of $100,000 home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). This article analyzes how both options have become cheaper than earlier this year. HELOCs, with their variable rates, are better positioned to benefit from future cuts, though they also carry the risk of rate increases, making budgeting difficult. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing stability but missing out on further reductions unless refinanced. Homeowners are advised to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each product, considering long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>YouTube, owned by Alphabet, announced it will reinstate accounts of creators previously banned for violating COVID-19 and election misinformation policies that are no longer in effect. This move, communicated in response to a House Judiciary Committee subpoena, reflects the company's commitment to free expression and acknowledges the significant reach of conservative voices. It's part of a broader trend of tech companies rolling back content moderation policies after facing pressure from Donald Trump and conservatives who argued their voices were unlawfully stifled.

          <p>Ukraine has significantly ramped up its domestic drone production, now manufacturing millions annually, to both defend its front lines and conduct long-range strikes deep inside Russia. This article highlights companies like Fire Point, which produces drones capable of striking targets up to 3,000 kilometers away, focusing on Russian oil and gas infrastructure. Ukrainian military strategists believe targeting Russia's economic assets, rather than just casualties, is key to ending the war, as Russia 'doesn't care about people's lives' but losing money is painful. This self-reliant approach has led to a measurable impact on Russian oil exports and domestic fuel shortages.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas aims to incentivize companies to hire Americans, but economists predict mixed results. While some U.S. technology workers might see short-term job gains, many experts warn the policy could slow long-term economic growth by restricting access to skilled labor. Research suggests H-1B workers often help firms expand and create additional jobs, rather than displacing native-born workers. The White House, however, dismisses these studies, asserting the fee protects Americans from 'cheap, foreign labor' and addresses program abuse. (not investment advice)</p>
