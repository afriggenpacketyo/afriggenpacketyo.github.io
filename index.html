        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced it will not defend a federal grant program for colleges with large Hispanic student populations, deeming it unconstitutional. Citing the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against affirmative action, the department argues the program provides an unfair advantage based on ethnicity. This decision follows a lawsuit by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, which claimed the program's 25% Hispanic enrollment threshold is discriminatory. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities has moved to intervene, arguing the grants are essential for redressing funding disparities and are constitutionally sound.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal grant funding from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. These policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ruling specifically protects Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants, which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars for the affected municipalities. This decision marks a significant setback for the administration's broader effort to compel local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration enforcement, a campaign that has included numerous legal challenges against cities and states across the country.</p>

          <p>Newly released transcripts from an interview with Ghislaine Maxwell reveal she told U.S. officials she never witnessed inappropriate behavior from Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. Speaking from prison, the convicted sex-trafficker also claimed that a rumored Jeffrey Epstein "client list" does not exist and called allegations against Prince Andrew "mind-blowingly not conceivable." Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence, is seeking a presidential pardon. The 300 pages of transcripts also include her denial of introducing Prince Andrew to Epstein and her assertion that a famous photograph of the prince with accuser Virginia Giuffre is fake.</p>

Prosecutors argue she was the matriarch who orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot to resolve a bitter custody dispute involving her daughter, Wendi Adelson. Three other individuals, including Adelson's son Charlie, have already been convicted and sentenced for their roles in the scheme. Key evidence against Donna Adelson includes a 2023 attempt to flee to Vietnam, a country without a U.S. extradition treaty, which prosecutors describe as a clear sign of guilt.</p>

          <p>Despite not being China's newest or most powerful weapon, the DF-31 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remains a cornerstone of the nation's nuclear deterrent. A recent full-range test, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated the missile's capability to reach the U.S. mainland, reinforcing China's credible second-strike nuclear capability.

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted for the 31st time since December, sending lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption is contained and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma buildup in a lower chamber is forcing periodic, high-pressure releases through narrow vents, creating the dramatic fountains. While the current eruption's duration is uncertain, it follows historical patterns of episodic activity, and researchers continue to monitor the volcano for changes using seismic and ground-deformation sensors.</p>

The legislation aims to redraw the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, a move prompted by former President Trump to bolster Republican chances in the 2026 midterm elections. The bill's passage follows a weeks-long standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum.

This aggressive satirical approach comes as the show's parent company, Paramount, navigates a politically sensitive environment following a merger deal that requires its news division to address perceived bias. Despite this pressure, creators Matt and Trey Parker are leveraging a new billion-dollar streaming deal with Paramount+, which appears to have insulated them from corporate interference. The show's success suggests that for Paramount, the business of a hit franchise currently trumps political considerations.</p>

          <h2>California Governor's Social Media Strategy Against Trump Recalls Earlier 'Resistance' Tactics</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office has adopted a satirical social media strategy, using one of its official accounts to mimic and mock Donald Trump's online persona. This approach is part of Newsom's broader counter-offensive against Republican political maneuvers, such as Texas's recent redistricting efforts. The article argues that this tactic is a throwback to the 2017-era "resistance" comedy, which ultimately proved ineffective at politically damaging Trump. While Newsom's policy responses are seen as necessary, the commentary suggests that parodying Trump only reinforces his dominance of the political narrative, rather than creating a distinct and compelling alternative for Democrats.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent choice of attire for a meeting with President Trump at the White House has been interpreted as a deliberate act of "wardrobe diplomacy." After being criticized for wearing a casual Henley shirt during a contentious previous visit, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black canvas blazer and collared shirt. This subtle change was seen as a signal of a more serious, diplomatic approach, moving away from his bunker-chic wartime look. The shift in clothing appeared to improve the meeting's tone, illustrating how even seemingly minor details can send powerful political messages in high-stakes international relations.</p>

          <p>Some businesses across the U.S. are bringing back "recession specials," a marketing trend reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, as a potential sign of deteriorating consumer sentiment. Establishments from New York to San Francisco are offering discounted meals and themed events that explicitly reference economic anxiety and inflation. This trend aligns with recent data from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which has fallen due to concerns over trade policy and expectations of a broader economic slowdown. The revival of these promotions suggests businesses are reacting to consumers' growing concerns about their financial stability and future income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of devastating storms like Hurricane Ian, Florida is grappling with how to rebuild for a more resilient future. Some residents are relocating to inland, purpose-built communities like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with storm-proof features and survived Ian with minimal damage. Others, particularly in lower-income areas with deep community roots, are relying on city programs and nonprofits to rebuild their homes to be stronger and more elevated. However, these efforts face significant challenges as federal funding for mitigation measures declines, forcing a greater reliance on local and private initiatives to protect against increasingly severe weather.</p>

          <p>Public schools across El Salvador are now enforcing strict new disciplinary rules, including mandatory military-style haircuts for boys and daily inspections of uniforms. The order comes from the new education minister, a high-ranking military officer appointed by President Nayib Bukele, who defends the measures as necessary for restoring classroom order. Some teachers' unions have condemned the move as a "regrettable militarization" of education, expressing concern about potential abuses of power. The policy is part of President Bukele's broader, and often authoritarian, approach to imposing order, which has been popular for reducing gang violence but criticized for eroding civil liberties.</p>

Many people end up retiring earlier than planned due to health or employment issues rather than financial readiness.
