        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the G7 summit in Canada, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba championed the established global economic order that promotes reduced trade barriers. Ishiba's defense comes amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral approach to trade, which have strained the group's ability to address global challenges. Trump reiterated his dissatisfaction with Russia's expulsion from the group and even suggested including China. The G7 leaders collectively called for de-escalation in the Middle East while supporting Israel's security, but no detailed joint statement is expected at the summit's end. </p>

          <p>According to Goldman Sachs analysts, China's private enterprises are experiencing a resurgence as regulatory restrictions are being relaxed, which will allow non-state firms to pursue technological advancements and international expansion. The private sector's renewed vigor is evident in investment patterns, including increased capital expenditure, overseas expansion plans, R&D spending, and fundraising activities. The report emphasizes that the rebound's sustainability depends on predictable policies, macro stimulus to combat disinflation, and stable US-China relations. China's private sector contributes significantly to the country's GDP, urban employment, and tax revenue, but receives a disproportionately small share of bank loans.</p>

          <p>A Russian strike on Kyiv has resulted in at least 15 fatalities and numerous injuries, marking one of the most intense bombardments on the capital since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukrainian officials reported that a total of 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched at the country, while Russia claims to have intercepted 147 Ukrainian drones overnight. The strikes on Kyiv lasted over nine hours, forcing residents to seek shelter underground, with a ballistic missile hitting a nine-story apartment building. Rescue teams are currently working to free people trapped under the rubble, as Russia has intensified its air attacks against Ukrainian cities in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>Following last week's plane crash in India that claimed the lives of at least 270 people, investigators are examining the aircraft's black boxes to determine the cause of the disaster. The Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 241 people on board and 29 on the ground. Experts from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, along with assistance from the U.K., the U.S., and Boeing officials, are involved in the probe. The black boxes, containing cockpit conversations and flight data, are crucial for piecing together the sequence of events and understanding the factors that led to the crash. </p>

Trump's departure followed French President Emmanuel Macron's comments about a ceasefire offer, which Trump refuted. The G7 economies also addressed Trump's tariff policies and support for Ukraine, while Trump reiterated his view that Russia's expulsion from the group in 2014 was a mistake.</p>

The order also addresses aerospace products but does not include the expected removal of charges on steel imports, with further negotiations planned.

The government has accepted all of Casey's recommendations; however, the report itself emphasizes that many of the highlighted problems have been known for years, yet action has been lacking. The report underscores the need to see victims as children who have experienced sexual assault, rather than dismissing them as "wayward teenagers."</p>

          <p>Fans attending a Club World Cup match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, have described the conditions as "dangerous" due to high heat, lack of water access, and tightly packed crowds. Supporters reported having to dispose of full water bottles before entering, long lines for water, and people in distress inside the venue. The Rose Bowl typically allows sealed water bottles, but this was not the case for this event, leading to increased frustration among attendees. The stadium's policies may change depending on the event, and FIFA's directives appear to be taking precedence.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome uses interceptor missiles to protect against incoming rockets. Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, argues that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's size and the different types of missiles that would be used. He compares the difference in scale to "the difference between a kayak and a battleship."</p>

Despite facing challenges from an oppressive government and US sanctions, Iran had been experiencing steady progress due to the efforts of its people. The election of President Masoud Pezeshkian aimed to repair Iran's social contract, and there were signs of economic recovery and improved regional relations. However, the attacks have disrupted these positive trends and undermined the aspirations of the Iranian people, who are now caught in a war they did not want.</p>

          <p>President Trump's comments on the Israel-Iran conflict have been ambiguous, ranging from supporting Israel's strikes to distancing himself from them. His options include escalating the conflict by supporting Netanyahu's pressure, maintaining a middle ground by reiterating that the US is not involved in Israel's attacks, or pulling back and listening to MAGA voices who reject traditional support for Israel. The article notes the influence of domestic support and the pressure from various political factions on Trump's decision-making process. The situation has been further complicated by the abandonment of planned talks between Trump's envoy and Iranian officials.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani pitched in a major league game for the first time since August 2023, allowing one run in one inning, and drove in two runs in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-3 win over the San Diego Padres. Ohtani's fastball reached 100 miles per hour during his outing at Dodger Stadium. At the plate, Ohtani went 2-for-4 with a walk and two strikeouts, contributing a run-scoring double and an RBI single. The Dodgers had six of their 10 hits in the fourth inning, and six relievers limited the Padres to four hits over eight innings.</p>
