            <p>Multiple news outlets are covering Katy Perry's brief space flight as part of an all-female crew, with headlines playing on her song lyrics. The Financial Times notes the celebrity space venture but focuses on risky corporate borrowers facing challenges in the bond market. The Daily Mail criticizes the space flight as a step back for women and highlights the ongoing bin strikes in Birmingham, where union workers rejected a deal to end the dispute. Other papers focus on Chinese investment in British infrastructure and betting offences related to the timing of the 2024 general election.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing $2.2 billion in federal funds to Harvard University after the institution refused to comply with demands to overhaul its policies on antisemitism, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated that the university would not surrender its independence or constitutional rights. The administration's demands included leadership reforms, a halt to DEI policies, and an audit of viewpoint diversity among students and faculty. This action has sparked both support for Harvard's stance on academic freedom and criticism over the handling of antisemitism on college campuses.</p>

            <p>Senior advisors close to President Trump privately warned that proposed tariffs could devastate global financial markets and harm the U.S. economy. Internal disagreements arose before the announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs, with some officials predicting serious economic instability. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cautioned against broad tariffs, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned of global disaster. Despite these warnings, the administration initially proceeded with the tariffs, leading to market volatility and prompting a temporary pause on some tariffs after criticism from CEOs and market analysts.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration told a federal judge that it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported, despite court orders to do so. This claim came hours after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele stated he would not voluntarily return Garcia. The administration maintains that it cannot forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign nation. The married father of three was deported to El Salvador due to an administrative error.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in an antitrust trial, defending his company against allegations of operating a social media monopoly. The FTC alleges Meta unfairly dominated the market through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, seeking to break up the company by forcing a spinoff. Zuckerberg argued that there is plenty of competition in social media from apps like TikTok, X, and YouTube. He also stated he wanted to buy Instagram because of its camera technology, not its social network.</p>

            <p>This article, accompanied by a cartoon, questions why many world leaders are remaining silent on the situation in Gaza. It suggests that the issue might be perceived as too difficult or sensitive to address, prompting leaders to avoid taking a public stance. The cartoon serves as a visual commentary on the perceived lack of vocal opposition or concern from international figures regarding the ongoing conflict and its humanitarian implications.</p>

            <p>A third federal judge has temporarily blocked some deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, preventing the Trump administration from removing noncitizens in Colorado who are subject to the Act. This order will remain in effect for two weeks, with a hearing set to consider extending it.

            <p>Research indicates a significant drop in the number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's subsidized theaters, decreasing by almost a third in the last decade. Funding cuts, rising costs, and a shift in audience tastes are contributing factors. Some venues are co-producing more shows to spread costs, resulting in larger-scale productions. However, smaller shows and opportunities for emerging artists are being squeezed out, leading to concerns about the future of British theater.</p>

            <p>A CNBC survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring supply chains back to the US. Most companies surveyed believe reshoring would significantly increase costs and instead plan to relocate supply chains to lower-tariff countries. The survey also revealed concerns about consumer demand, raw material prices, and the administration's inconsistent strategy. A majority of respondents felt that the Trump administration was "bullying corporate America," leading to widespread order cancellations and expectations of reduced consumer spending.
