            <p>A coalition of small U.S. businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, contesting the legality of recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit, submitted to the U.S. Court of International Trade, argues that Trump's claim of trade deficits constituting a national emergency is an overreach of executive power, violating Congress's authority to levy tariffs. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses, claims the tariffs are devastating small enterprises and lack justification, even affecting countries without trade deficits with the U.S. The lawsuit seeks to declare the tariffs illegal and reaffirm the principle of no taxation without representation.</p>

Zuckerberg acknowledged Facebook's struggles with mobile users before acquiring Instagram. Meta defends its acquisitions, stating that Instagram and WhatsApp have thrived under its ownership and that its services are free, thus not indicative of monopoly power.</p>

El Salvador's President Bukele insists he lacks the power to return Garcia, creating a legal and diplomatic standoff. This defiance raises concerns about the administration's willingness to disregard court rulings and the potential consequences for both citizens and non-citizens.</p>

This effort closely resembles the Bush v. Gore case, as the Republican justices are attempting to selectively toss out ballots in Democratic counties. A federal judge has issued a temporary order preventing the certification of the election results until the case is fully litigated in federal court. The legal violation identified in Bush v. Gore was that the Florida Supreme Court ordered just three counties — counties that tended to favor Democrats — to recount their ballots, a problem exacerbated by the fact that each of these three counties used different procedures to conduct this recount.</p>
