          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is 'actively looking at' suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail the constitutional right to challenge detention in court. Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing that the United States faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants 'invading' the country. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus and that unilateral suspensions by the President are unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The US and China are set to resume trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since the US imposed tariffs on China in January. Both sides have signaled a willingness to break the deadlock, although neither wants to appear to be backing down. Tariffs have hurt both countries, impacting factory output in China and contributing to economic uncertainty in the US. The timing is also key for Beijing as it coincides with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, demonstrating China's alternative global leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs based on national security concerns.

Tariffs could harm the aerospace industry, which relies on a global supply chain despite producing a significant trade surplus. Companies like Boeing, RTX, and GE Aerospace have expressed concerns about the potential impact on suppliers and increased costs.</p>
