          <p>Gregg Wallace has publicly defended himself against allegations of inappropriate behavior, stating that while he acknowledges some comments may have been insensitive, he denies the claims of groping. Wallace, who stepped down from presenting MasterChef following the allegations, expressed feeling "under attack" and contemplated suicide due to the immense pressure and social media abuse. He admitted to putting a sock over his private parts and opening his dressing room door shouting "hooray", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place. An internal inquiry by MasterChef's production company, Banijay, was launched to investigate the historical allegations. Wallace was recently diagnosed with autism and says he accepts he was "very slow to wake up" to a changing work environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has seemingly shifted his rhetoric on Gaza, advocating for increased aid to the region during a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Trump emphasized the suffering of people in Gaza and the need for food and medicine, while noting that Netanyahu "felt well" about the push to get more aid into Gaza. This message contrasts with Trump's previous aggressive stance, where he warned Hamas of consequences if hostages were not released. Concerns remain in Israel regarding aid potentially reaching Hamas instead of civilians. </p>

          <p>A massive explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port near Bandar Abbas, Iran, has resulted in at least four deaths and 500 injuries. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, caused significant damage to nearby buildings and triggered a large fire at the container terminal. Initial reports suggest the explosion was caused by flammable materials stored in unsealed containers, but one analyst firm said it believed the affected containers had contained solid fuel for Iranian missiles. President Pezeshkian has expressed sympathy for the victims and announced a government investigation.</p>

          <p>According to a conscious parenting coach who has studied over 200 children, the phrase "You're okay" can be detrimental to a child's emotional development. This phrase can teach children to doubt their own emotions, invalidate their experiences, short-circuit emotional processing, and condition them to believe they must suppress their feelings to remain accepted. Over time, this can reshape their nervous system to expect disconnection, making it harder to trust, regulate and feel safe being fully themselves. The coach suggests validating their feelings by helping the child to identify, name and regulate their emotions.</p>

          <p>The death of Virginia Giuffre leaves several questions unanswered regarding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Giuffre was a prominent accuser of Epstein and his associates, including Prince Andrew, revealing the trafficking and sexual assault of young women. The photo of her and Prince Andrew, taken in London in 2001, became emblematic of the royal's entanglement with Epstein and was central to his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019. The origins of the picture remain uncertain. Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison in the US and Prince Andrew has stepped down from all public duties.</p>

The report highlights the US's dependence on China for essential components in its military equipment, despite political rhetoric to the contrary. China has imposed export controls on several critical minerals, impacting the manufacturing of military equipment across all branches of the US armed forces.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights the impact of breastfeeding difficulties on mothers' mental health, with many reporting feelings of failure and guilt. The UK has one of the lowest rates of exclusive breastfeeding, with women who find it smooth going are portrayed as the default, and before you have a baby there’s a kind of institutional omertà in the health service and among some antenatal course leaders about all the ways in which it can go wrong. The author argues for decoupling breastfeeding from the cult of perfect motherhood and providing better support for mothers, regardless of their feeding choices.</p>
