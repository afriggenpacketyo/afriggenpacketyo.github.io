            <p>St. John's College and the U.S. Naval Academy held their 41st annual Annapolis Cup croquet match, a tradition that began in the early 1980s after a challenge between a St. John's student and the Commandant of the Naval Academy. Thousands of attendees, many in fancy dress, watched as the Navy team secured a victory in the final match, leading to a jubilant celebration. Despite the loss, St. John's students gathered to sing Palestrina's "Sicut Cervus," reflecting the unique spirit of the event, where the unpredictable, bumpy lawn adds to the challenge and charm.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States have commenced talks in Oman regarding Iran's nuclear program, marking the highest-level meeting between the two nations since 2018, when the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi expressed the country's desire for a "fair agreement," while the U.S. delegation is led by Steve Witkoff. The talks aim to de-escalate regional tensions and potentially secure prisoner exchanges, with both sides seeking a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief; however, significant disagreements remain on the scope and terms of any potential agreement.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A bill approved by the Tennessee Senate would allow public schools to check the citizenship or legal immigration status of every student, potentially denying enrollment or requiring tuition for undocumented children. This move is being criticized as unconstitutional, violating the 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, which prohibits states from denying students a free public education based on immigration status. While proponents claim the bill is fiscally responsible, critics argue it's a disingenuous attack on undocumented children, masking a deeper issue of regressive tax policies. The bill faced significant opposition, with many senators expressing disagreement and quoting Bible verses about compassion for children.</p>

            <p>Despite warnings from economists and business leaders about the potential for recession and inflation, much of right-wing media has either applauded President Trump's tariffs or avoided criticizing him directly. While financial markets experienced significant drops, some commentators downplayed the economic risks, emphasizing the importance of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Some outlets focused on positive aspects, such as reported tariff revenue, while others acknowledged potential negative consequences but remained supportive of Trump's overall agenda. The article highlights the challenge to right-wing media, which often acts as a cheerleader for Trump and his policies, when those policies cause economic disruption.</p>

            <p>Personal finance columnist Liz Weston addresses a reader's question about credit card debt and estate planning, clarifying that credit card debt does not simply vanish upon death, instead becoming the responsibility of the deceased's estate. Creditors can pursue claims against property transferred through transfer-on-death designations, even outside of probate. Weston advises consulting with an estate planning attorney to explore alternative solutions and suggests paying off the debt if possible, or discussing bankruptcy options if not. She also clarifies rules around Social Security spousal and survivor benefits.</p>

            <p>China has called on Britain to join it in defending international trade as Beijing seeks to bolster support against Donald Trump's tariffs. Chinese Vice-Minister for Commerce Ling Ji emphasized the importance of multilateralism in the face of unilateralism and protectionism during a meeting with Britain's Trade Minister, Douglas Alexander. Alexander reportedly indicated Britain's willingness to collaborate with China on free trade and market opening to address current challenges. The discussions coincided with China's announcement of increased duties on U.S. goods.</p>

            <p>The article draws parallels between Donald Trump's tariff policies and Liz Truss's economic policies in the UK, suggesting both leaders triggered market instability and increased borrowing costs. While the US is less vulnerable than the UK to capital flight, Trump's actions have led to a falling dollar and rising Treasury bond yields, potentially creating a 'moron premium' for American investors. The article questions whether Trump intentionally caused market pain to demonstrate America's commitment to economic decoupling from China, but warns that breaking complex systems can lead to unintended consequences. It also examines potential geopolitical strategies behind Trump's actions and the potential for a fractured Western alliance.</p>

            <p>The article argues that Congress should reclaim its constitutional power to levy tariffs from President Trump, who has been acting under a dubious interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. It asserts that Trump's erratic tariff policies create instability and uncertainty in the global economy, invite corruption, and undermine the rule of law. The author urges citizens to pressure their representatives to cancel Trump's tariffs and clarify that he lacks the power to impose new ones, emphasizing that the American project is incompatible with aggregating extreme power in any individual.</p>

The capital allocation committee will explore options for funding Homes.com without relying on cash flow from the core business, potentially leading to a spinoff or sale of part of the business.

            <p>The article discusses growing concerns among investors about a potential exodus of assets from the U.S. due to aggressive and constantly changing trade policies. The sell-off in financial markets, coupled with a declining dollar and falling Treasury prices, is fueling fears that Trump's policies are doing long-term damage to the financial standing of the U.S. Some analysts suggest a rotation out of U.S. assets has already begun, with the dollar losing its structural attractiveness as the world's global reserve currency. This could have real economic impacts, including discrimination against companies with significant foreign sales and potential anti-American sentiment.</p>

The first ten days of April have been particularly sunny, with many areas already exceeding 80% of their average monthly sunshine. Hay fever sufferers will continue to experience high pollen levels, mainly due to Birch and Ash tree pollen, although levels are expected to decrease by Wednesday as the weather becomes more unsettled.</p>

            <p>The article explores how China may be using Vietnam to evade higher U.S. tariffs. Foreign direct investment in Vietnam has increased as firms seek to manage risks stemming from production in China. However, a portion of Vietnam's rising exports to the U.S. may be Chinese products that were rerouted to evade higher tariff rates, particularly after the escalation of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018. This rerouting has become a concern for the United States, potentially leading to heightened tariff rates on goods imported from Vietnam.</p>

            <p>The article examines the debate at the core of Donald Trump's tariff war: the trade-off between preserving American jobs and providing affordable goods to consumers. While tariffs could potentially protect jobs in specific industries by discouraging imports, U.S. consumers would likely bear the cost through higher prices. The article cites a Pennsylvania State University economist who found that regions with higher exposure to import competition from China suffered manufacturing job losses, but also benefited from more affordable goods.</p>
