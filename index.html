          <p>This article explores the life and legacy of Malcolm X, highlighting his advocacy for Black self-confidence and resistance against oppression 'by any means necessary'. Born in 1925, his early life was marred by racism and violence, leading to his involvement with the Nation of Islam. Later in life, a pilgrimage to Mecca transformed his views, prompting him to advocate for alliances among oppressed people of color. Despite his assassination in 1965, Malcolm X's message continues to resonate, particularly in hip-hop culture and discussions about racial injustice.</p>

Higher rates tend to push up the value of the U.S. dollar, but the currency slid, which suggested investors may be turning against the United States in general.</p>
