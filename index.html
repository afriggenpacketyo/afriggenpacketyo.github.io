        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is expected to announce its new iPhone 17 models, and analysts predict a potential price increase despite CEO Tim Cook's successful efforts to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs. While smartphones have largely been shielded, rising component costs and global trends may lead Apple to raise prices, possibly by eliminating lower-storage entry-level models to effectively increase the starting price. The company has absorbed some tariff costs but may now pass them on to consumers, though any announcement is likely to focus on new features rather than trade policy.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced plans to eliminate all state-mandated childhood vaccines for school and daycare attendance. Dr. Ladapo described the mandates as an immoral infringement on parental rights, comparing them to "slavery," and stated the health department will work with the legislature to repeal them. The move, which would make Florida the first state to take such broad action, has been criticized by opponents as a "public health disaster" that could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and polio.</p>

          <p>Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring gathered on Capitol Hill to share emotional testimony and demand the public release of Department of Justice files related to his case. They directly challenged President Trump's characterization of the issue as a "hoax," urging him and lawmakers to support a bipartisan effort to compel the documents' release. The push, led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, aims to uncover why Epstein was protected for so long and who else was involved. House leadership has so far resisted the move, favoring a committee-led review process.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, Britain's deputy prime minister and housing secretary, has admitted to underpaying stamp duty on a flat she purchased, attributing the error to incorrect initial legal advice. The issue relates to the sale of her stake in a family home in Greater Manchester, which was partly held in a trust for her disabled son, a detail that complicated the tax assessment. Rayner has referred herself for investigation by the prime minister's standards adviser and contacted tax authorities to settle the outstanding amount, while facing calls from the opposition to be sacked.</p>

          <h2>Global Analysis of Satellite Data Reveals Rapid Freshwater Depletion and Expanding Arid Regions</h2>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of over two decades of satellite data indicates that humanity is rapidly depleting underground freshwater reserves, leading to the expansion of "mega-drying" regions across the globe. Researchers attribute this alarming trend to climate change and the widespread overpumping of groundwater for agriculture and urban use, which now contributes more to sea-level rise than melting glaciers. The study warns that this unsustainable water loss threatens food production, economic growth, and global stability, with nearly three-fourths of the world's population living in countries that are losing water.</p>

          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers in 2025 is projected to be $1,976, though actual payments vary widely based on earnings history and the age at which benefits are claimed. While the maximum possible benefit can reach $5,108 for high earners who delay until age 70, many retirees find the standard payment insufficient to cover all living expenses. The article outlines several strategies to boost retirement income, such as purchasing annuities for a guaranteed stream of payments, utilizing a reverse mortgage, or delaying Social Security claims to receive larger monthly checks.

The investment is part of a broader trend by the administration to take a more active role in the private sector, including stakes in other tech and materials companies.

Prosecutors used the cutting-edge technique to link Heuermann and his family members to hairs found on the remains of multiple victims. The defense has challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is unlicensed in the state, but the decision marks a significant victory for the prosecution and sets a precedent for future cases.</p>

          <h2>German Defense Commissioner Advocates for Mandatory National Service for Men and Women</h2>

          <p>As Germany debates reintroducing a form of military service, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, Henning Otte, has called for a mandatory year of service for all men and women. He suggests this service could be fulfilled not only in the military but also in emergency services or cultural and volunteer organizations. This proposal goes beyond the current government draft, which only requires young men to complete a questionnaire about voluntary military service. Otte argues that the changed security situation in Europe necessitates a new discussion about compulsory service, which Germany abolished in 2011.</p>

          <p>Speaking in Beijing, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Russia will achieve all its objectives in Ukraine by military force if a negotiated settlement is not reached. He reiterated demands that Ukraine abandon its NATO aspirations and repeated claims of discrimination against ethnic Russians. Putin dismissed the idea of an imminent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling it potentially pointless without prior preparation. His comments came after attending a military parade with leaders from China and North Korea, a gathering President Trump characterized as a conspiracy against the United States.</p>

          <p>When considering where to deposit a significant sum like $50,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD), the "best" rate is not always the highest one. Currently, short-term CDs of one year or less offer higher interest rates, with top 6-month CDs yielding around 4.45%. However, longer-term CDs, such as a 2-year CD at 4.10%, can generate substantially more total interest due to the extended compounding period. Savers must decide whether their priority is securing the highest possible rate for a short duration or maximizing their overall earnings over a longer, more predictable term.

Wise, a former FBI agent, was charged with multiple felonies after being recorded urging rioters to "Kill 'em!" in reference to police officers. His case was dismissed following President Trump's sweeping pardons for those involved in the insurrection. In a letter to the Attorney General, the senators called the hiring a "slap in the face to law enforcement" and a politicization of the department, demanding details about his role and security clearance.</p>

The student observes classmates using tools like ChatGPT to instantly generate homework answers and essay annotations, which erodes the learning process and the shared experience of academic challenge. This widespread outsourcing of thinking has removed the urgency from deadlines and diminished critical skills like discipline and grit. The author argues that schools must adapt by shifting assessments toward tasks that AI cannot easily complete, such as oral exams and personalized projects, to foster genuine intellectual growth and integrity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a federal judge's decision that found the deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement duties in Los Angeles to be illegal. The judge ruled that the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that generally prohibits using the military for domestic policing, and barred the troops from making arrests or performing crowd control. The ruling noted that the President's actions raised concerns about the creation of "a national police force with the President as its chief." The appeal comes as the administration considers similar deployments in other U.S. cities to address what it claims is rampant crime.</p>

He announced the Met will implement a more stringent process to ensure only the most serious cases involving a clear risk of harm are pursued. The arrest for anti-transgender posts has sparked a fierce debate over free speech and the appropriate role of law enforcement in moderating online discourse.</p>

Islam notes a potential tension between the Treasury and the government's official forecaster, the OBR, over the assessment of her economic policies. The chancellor aims to be seen as a reformer, but she faces difficult choices on spending and taxes, with bond markets closely watching her every move over the next critical 12 weeks.

The lawsuit claims that Army officials were aware of reservist Robert Card's deteriorating mental health, paranoia, and access to firearms but failed to act on numerous warnings, including a text from a fellow soldier predicting he would "do a mass shooting." The suit argues the Army broke its promise to Card's family to remove his weapons and misled local law enforcement, thereby preventing intervention before he killed 18 people in October 2023.</p>
