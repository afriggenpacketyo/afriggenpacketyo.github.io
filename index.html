          <p>Jay Wynne, a former BBC Weather presenter known for his regular forecasts on the BBC News at Ten, has died at the age of 56 following a long-term illness. Wynne joined the BBC in 2000 and was praised by colleagues and his family for his gentle clarity, dry sense of humor, and engaging presentation style. Before his career in meteorology, he worked on a North Sea oil rig and taught English in Japan. Colleagues remembered him as a "lovely bloke and brilliant broadcaster" who blazed a trail for greater diversity in weather forecasting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution supporting a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine that explicitly excludes Hamas from future governance. The declaration, backed by France and Saudi Arabia, demands Hamas release all hostages, end its rule in Gaza, and transfer its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. This move, which passed with 142 votes in favor, is seen as a significant diplomatic step that directly condemns Hamas while laying groundwork for a sovereign Palestinian state. The vote precedes a summit where several nations are expected to formally recognize Palestine, increasing pressure on Israel.</p>

The visit coincides with a new UK aid package for Ukraine and highlights his ongoing commitment through the Invictus Games Foundation. This trip marks his first to the Ukrainian capital and serves as a high-profile gesture of solidarity with the nation's efforts to cope with the devastating human cost of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, dozens of Republican lawmakers have co-sponsored a House resolution to honor his life and condemn political violence. Led by Rep. Cory Mills, the resolution celebrates Kirk's work with Turning Point USA and reaffirms support for First Amendment rights to peaceful assembly. The measure calls the shooting a "horrific political assassination" and extends condolences to his family, while also recognizing the efforts of first responders. This legislative action reflects the significant impact of the event within conservative political circles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, to address what he described as a "deeply troubled" city. The move follows a similar federalization of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and Trump stated that both the state's governor and the city's mayor were supportive of the plan. This decision marks an expansion of the administration's strategy to use federal forces in cities, a policy that has faced legal challenges and opposition elsewhere. The president indicated he was inspired to act after a conversation with a business executive about safety concerns in the city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has begun using the term "monkeypox" again, reversing its 2022 adoption of "mpox," a name change led by the World Health Organization to reduce stigma. The original name was deemed problematic due to its inaccurate association with monkeys and its use as a racist and homophobic slur during the global outbreak. Public health experts have expressed bafflement at the reversion, suggesting it is a politically motivated move by the Trump administration that could create confusion and reintroduce stigmatizing language. The Department of Health and Human Services has not provided a clear explanation for the change.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is managing a delicate political balance following President Trump's federal takeover of the city's police force to address crime. While crime rates have reportedly dropped, Bowser has offered subtle pushback against the presence of federal agents, contrasting with her more confrontational stance during Trump's first term. This strategic cooperation has drawn criticism from some local officials who view it as appeasement to an authoritarian move.

This shift in consumer sentiment indicates a tougher operating environment for foreign brands in the country.

          <p>A U.S. citizen in Los Angeles is part of a major lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging he was racially profiled and wrongfully detained by federal immigration agents. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, challenges indiscriminate raids that have instilled fear in Southern California communities. A recent Supreme Court decision lifted restrictions on these operations, allowing agents to stop individuals based on appearances, a move critics warn legalizes racial profiling. The plaintiff's experience highlights the human impact of the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics and the ongoing legal battles over civil liberties.</p>

          <p>China's liquid-fueled DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) may possess enhanced readiness capabilities that rival solid-fuel missiles. According to a defense expert, technological advances in its rocket nozzles suggest improvements in fuel storage, potentially allowing the missile to be stored fully fueled in a silo and "ready to launch any time." This would overcome the traditional disadvantage of liquid-fuel rockets, which typically require lengthy fueling procedures before launch. Such an upgrade would significantly increase the immediacy and strategic threat of this component of China's nuclear arsenal.</p>

According to Travis King, CEO of investment platform Realm, this strategy helps families diversify their portfolios and gain the benefits of direct real estate ownership without intensive management requirements. While institutional investors have long had significant real estate allocations, family offices are now catching up, with a focus on opportunities in sectors like office space.

          <p>Four decades after the original, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" reunites the fictional heavy-metal band for one last show, exploring themes of obsolescence and nostalgia. The film finds the band members in absurd post-rock careers before they are brought back together by the death of their former manager. While the sequel may not have the groundbreaking impact of the 1984 classic, it retains the vital deadpan comedy of its main characters. The movie serves as an in-joke for an era where rock and roll itself often feels like a legacy act, complete with cameos from real-life music legends.</p>

          <p>For individuals in their 70s with around $500,000 in savings, financial planning should shift from aggressive growth to risk minimization and ensuring long-term stability. Key steps include conducting a full financial review to understand monthly needs, consolidating accounts to simplify management, and potentially working with a fee-only fiduciary planner. Instead of aiming for rapid growth, the focus should be on creating a sustainable income stream from existing assets. A conservatively invested portfolio of this size could reasonably supplement income for many years, making retirement achievable with careful planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent UN report reveals that ongoing conflict and insecurity have forced the closure of nearly 15,000 schools across West and Central Africa, disrupting the education of over three million children. The situation is particularly severe in Nigeria, where the Boko Haram insurgency has pushed many children out of the education system permanently, with fears of boys being recruited as child soldiers. Insecurity from kidnapping and banditry causes families to keep their children home, especially daughters. Despite some government interventions, the long-term damage to the region's educational infrastructure is profound.</p>

Qatar, a key mediator in the Gaza conflict, had requested the emergency meeting, arguing the attack undermines peace efforts.

The movie contrasts this with a rival boy band of demons who feed on obsessive worship for destructive purposes. Filled with catchy music and inside jokes for K-pop enthusiasts, the film celebrates the positive, creative energy of fan communities while also acknowledging the potentially parasitic nature of the artist-fan relationship.</p>
