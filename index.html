          <p>Authorities in Washington state are searching for Travis Decker, a 32-year-old father, after his three young daughters were found dead.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated that reaching a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping is proving "extremely hard" amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. This statement comes after White House suggestions of potential talks between the two leaders this week, following stalled trade discussions. The two nations have traded blame for violating a prior agreement, with the U.S. criticizing China's rare earth export restrictions and China condemning U.S. technology access limitations and visa revocations for Chinese students. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed concerns over the Trump administration's "negative measures" to the U.S. Ambassador David Perdue.</p>

          <p>The chancellor has announced a partial U-turn on winter fuel payments, ensuring more people will receive the allowance this winter. The payment, which helps cover energy costs during the coldest months, was previously limited to those on pension credit, a policy criticized for disproportionately affecting lower-income pensioners. While details are pending the autumn Budget, the means test will be increased to broaden eligibility, however, the pensions minister clarified that the payment will not return to being universally distributed to all pensioners, as the government aims to avoid paying millionaires. This adjustment seeks to balance fiscal responsibility with support for vulnerable pensioners.</p>

          <p>Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the "Global Fact-Checking Network" (GFCN), claiming to combat fake news, but experts and established fact-checking sites criticize it as a Kremlin-aligned propaganda tool. The GFCN was co-founded by TASS, Russia's state-run news agency, and ANPO "Dialog Regions," both known for their close ties to the Kremlin, and both have faced sanctions and suspensions for spreading disinformation. Independent fact-checking relies on transparency and verifiable sourcing, but DW's review of GFCN articles revealed consistent problems with sourcing and methodology, including false figures and misleading claims. Observers say the GFCN's name is an attempt to mimic the legitimate International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to blur the line between journalism and propaganda.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History stumbled upon a new understanding of the Oort Cloud while preparing a planetarium show called "Encounters in the Milky Way." During a test run of a scene depicting the Oort Cloud, they noticed a spiral shape within the inner section, resembling a bar with two waving arms, similar to the Milky Way galaxy. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell. The researchers published their findings in The Astrophysical Journal, noting the difficulty of confirming the shape through observations but suggesting that further study of distant comet orbits could provide clues.</p>

While some Conservative figures acknowledged the importance of the funding, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized Labour's promises, and Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper urged the chancellor to deliver on the promises.

Despite a previous agreement on May 8 to reduce tariffs on metals to zero, the UK government was uncertain about receiving special treatment until the announcement. However, the exemption is contingent on finalizing the deal by July 9, creating uncertainty for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The UK also agreed to cut tariffs on some US beef products and ethanol, which has raised concerns about potential impacts on domestic steelmakers and the UK ethanol market.</p>

          <p>A congressional watchdog alleges that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has assembled a "rogues' gallery of extremists" to promote Donald Trump's crackdown on non-government organizations (NGOs). The House's Delivering on Government Efficiency (Doge) subcommittee, chaired by Greene, is holding a hearing to expose the use of federal funds by NGOs to advance "radical" agendas. The Congressional Integrity Project (CIP) condemns the hearing as "political theater" and hypocrisy, noting the substantial federal funding received by Republican allies and right-wing groups. The CIP criticizes Greene's witnesses as extremists and conspiracy theorists, highlighting their controversial statements and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

Barber, a social activist and director of Yale Divinity School's center for public theology, led a rally outside the Supreme Court before the protest. He condemned the Republican-controlled House for passing the bill and warned of its potential impact on Medicaid and health insurance access. Barber compared Senator Joni Ernst's rhetoric to justifications used by slaveowners, vowing to make Moral Mondays a regular feature of dissent against Trump's policies.</p>

The rules would set zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers, distributors, and installers, beginning in 2027 and increasing to 90% by 2036.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study reveals that over 90% of popular freshwater fish in Southern California carry human-infecting parasites, specifically trematodes, posing a risk to consumers who eat freshly caught fish. The parasites, including Haplorchis pumilio and Centrocestus formosanus, can cause gastrointestinal problems, weight loss, and lethargy, with rare cases leading to strokes or heart attacks. Researchers believe the parasites were introduced via the Malaysian trumpet snail and have identified them in various lakes and reservoirs across Southern California. To protect themselves, consumers are advised to thoroughly cook freshwater fish or eat previously frozen fish to kill any potential parasites.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that emotions persist due to a sustained signal in the brain following an experience, creating a broader state that influences subsequent events. Researchers recreated emotional responses in a lab using air puffs to the cornea, observing two distinct phases of brain activity: an initial sensory input spike and a later, sustained activity in emotion-related circuits. The study, published in the journal Science, found that this sustained response strengthens with repeated stimuli and can be blocked by ketamine, an anesthetic. While some experts question whether this lingering signal is specific to emotion, the research highlights the role of persistent brain signals in altering brain states.</p>
