          <p>Former President Donald Trump declared he has fired Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, citing alleged mortgage document fraud. Cook, appointed in 2022, has stated she will not resign, asserting Trump lacks the legal authority for her removal and threatening legal action. This dramatic move follows months of Trump's public criticism of the central bank's interest rate policies, setting up a potential legal battle over the Fed's independence. The dispute highlights the ongoing tension between political leadership and the central bank's monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>China plans to expand its national carbon market to include major industrial sectors by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, according to new guidelines. This initiative will also introduce absolute limits on emissions, a more stringent approach than the current intensity-based caps. The accelerated expansion aims to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market and demonstrate the government's commitment to achieving its climate targets. This significant policy shift is expected to spur demand within the market and contribute to a more aggressive emissions reduction pathway for the world's largest carbon polluter.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has labeled illegal immigration a "scourge," detailing his party's plans to detain and deport individuals entering the UK unlawfully. The proposals include leaving the European Court of Human Rights, repealing the Human Rights Act, and disapplying international treaties like the Refugee Convention to facilitate removals. Farage emphasized prioritizing the British people, while critics from Labour and the Tories dismissed the plans as lacking substance or being recycled ideas. The stance comes as nearly 28,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year, intensifying pressure on the government.</p>

          <p>China Evergrande Group has been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, concluding its dramatic rise and fall as the world's most indebted developer. Its collapse, triggered by Beijing's "three-red-line" policy, ignited a widespread and prolonged property crisis that continues to impact China's economic growth. While the peak default wave is believed to be over, the sector faces consolidation around state-backed developers as homebuyers favor safer options. The unwinding of Evergrande's massive debt and unfinished projects leaves a complex legacy, with uncertain prospects for creditors and homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK food price inflation has reached 4.2% this month, its highest in 18 months, primarily due to significant increases in the cost of chocolate, butter, and eggs. Poor cocoa harvests, exacerbated by climate change and crop disease, are cited for the rise in chocolate prices, while demand and labor costs impact butter and eggs. This uptick contributes to overall UK inflation, which stands at 3.8%, and signals a need for households to reassess budgets.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump warned China of "200% tariffs" if it curbs exports of rare-earth magnets, threatening the fragile trade truce between the two economic giants. Trump emphasized the US reliance on these magnets for manufacturing, citing their importance in industries like automotive and electronics. This statement underscores the critical leverage China holds, controlling about 90% of the global supply of rare-earth magnets. While a Chinese expert suggested Trump's remarks were a bluff to advance trade talks, the threat signals potential renewed trade tensions ahead of a temporary truce expiration.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung successfully navigated a potentially tense Oval Office meeting with former President Donald Trump by employing flattery and finding common ground on North Korea. Despite initial concerns sparked by a critical Truth Social post from Trump, Lee praised Trump's rapport with Kim Jong Un and asked him to be a "peacemaker." While economic and defense issues were largely sidestepped publicly, the meeting resulted in significant US-South Korea deals. Lee's diplomatic approach aimed to ensure a positive relationship, avoiding the confrontational encounters seen with other foreign leaders.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in China have conducted a successful pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the feasibility of xenotransplantation for respiratory organs. The genetically altered pig lung maintained viability and functionality for 216 hours in a brain-dead human recipient without infection or rejection. This achievement marks a significant step forward, addressing the "distinct challenges" of lung xenotransplantation, such as the high risk of infection due to direct air contact. While substantial further tests are required, this study highlights progress in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies, offering potential solutions to the global organ shortage crisis.</p>

          <p>A group of current and former FEMA officials has issued a warning to Congress, stating that the Trump administration's drastic cuts and leadership changes risk undoing decades of reforms implemented since Hurricane Katrina. The "Katrina Declaration" alleges that Mr. Trump's appointees lack qualifications and criticizes the termination of grants for disaster preparedness, including the BRIC program. While the administration defends its reforms as necessary to combat inefficiency, critics argue these actions "hinder the swift execution of our mission." The upheaval highlights a contentious debate over the agency's future and its ability to respond to natural disasters.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge has ruled that the state's Republican-controlled legislature must redraw its congressional boundaries for the 2026 elections. Judge Dianna Gibson declared the current map, drawn in 2021, unlawful, as it circumvented a voter-established commission designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The map divided Salt Lake County, a Democratic stronghold, among four districts, all of which subsequently elected Republicans. This ruling creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim House majority and emphasizes the ongoing national debate over fair electoral maps and voter representation.</p>
