          <p>Davey Johnson, a celebrated figure in Major League Baseball, has passed away at the age of 82. Johnson was a four-time All-Star infielder and a two-time World Series champion with the Baltimore Orioles during his playing career. He is most famously remembered for managing the 1986 New York Mets to a World Series title, and his .588 winning percentage remains the best in Mets franchise history. He was remembered fondly by former colleagues for his positive disposition and storytelling.</p>

          <p>A massive tourism project at Mount Sinai, a site sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is drawing significant backlash in Egypt. The development includes luxury hotels and shopping areas at the UNESCO World Heritage site, threatening its pristine landscape and spiritual character. The local Jebeleya Bedouin tribe reports their homes and camps have been demolished with little compensation to make way for the project. There are also deep concerns from the Greek Orthodox Church about the future of the historic St. Catherine's Monastery.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has initiated a new immigration enforcement surge in Massachusetts called "Patriot 2.0." The operation, expected to last several weeks, will focus on arresting and deporting immigrants, particularly those who have been released from local jails despite ICE requests to hold them. A DHS spokesperson stated the operation targets criminals and criticized Boston's sanctuary city policies. This move signals a continued crackdown on immigration under the Trump administration, following similar actions in other cities.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report into the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon has determined that a connecting cable between the two cabins snapped. The tragic incident, which resulted in 16 deaths and 21 injuries, occurred when the railway car derailed and crashed into a building. According to the report, the cable had passed a routine visual inspection on the morning of the accident with no anomalies detected. Two separate investigations, one by transportation authorities and another by prosecutors, are underway to determine the exact cause of the failure.</p>

          <p>Both Ukraine and Russia are heavily utilizing decoy military equipment to mislead each other on the battlefield. Ukrainian forces have successfully used full-scale models, such as plywood M777 howitzers, to trick Russian drones into wasting expensive ammunition on worthless targets. To be effective, these decoy positions are made to look realistic with details like wheel ruts and ammunition crates. Russia employs similar tactics, using imitation drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and make them expend valuable missiles.</p>

          <p>A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect for more than 25 million people across the U.S. Northeast, from Maryland to Maine. The storm system is expected to bring strong, potentially damaging wind gusts as its primary threat. Forecasters have also warned of the possibility of isolated large hail and a few brief tornadoes, particularly in northern New England. Additionally, slow-moving storms with torrential rain could lead to localized flash flooding in urban and poor-drainage areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to Chicago has been met with deeply divided reactions across the city. In some neighborhoods, residents weary of violent crime welcome the intervention, with one telling the BBC, "I can't wait till they get here." However, community leaders and activists on the South Side argue that troops are not the answer and that sustained funding for violence prevention programs is what is needed. The city's Latino communities also fear the troops could be used for immigration raids.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the tournament quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia. Despite the lopsided score, the performance was uncharacteristically sloppy, particularly in the first half when England struggled to execute their typically dominant driving maul. While the team's defense remained strong, keeping Australia scoreless after the interval, the untidy aspects of their play may offer encouragement to stronger opponents in the upcoming knockout stages.</p>

This approach includes media deals with major local broadcasters like Brazil's Globo and encouraging teams to engage directly with fans in their assigned markets.

Despite dominating possession, England struggled to create clear chances against the world's 174th-ranked team, relying on an own goal and a set-piece header to secure the win. The article suggests that under new coach Thomas Tuchel, the team has arguably regressed, lacking creativity and momentum ahead of more challenging fixtures.</p>
