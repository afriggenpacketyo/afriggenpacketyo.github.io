          <h2>French Open Official Defends Night Session Scheduling Amid Criticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 09:48:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, addressed criticism regarding the tournament's night session scheduling, which has predominantly featured men's singles matches. Since 2023, no women's singles match has been scheduled during the primetime slot, raising questions about promoting the women's game. Mauresmo justified the choices by suggesting that women's matches tend to be shorter, potentially going "really fast" due to being best-of-three sets. She also noted that the tournament aims to avoid late finishes by limiting night sessions to a single match, citing the success of a recent match between Gael Monfils and Jack Draper that ended at 11:45 PM local time as a measure of the schedule's success.

          <p>Nathan Laatsch, an IT specialist with the Defense Intelligence Agency, has been charged with attempting to provide classified information to a foreign government. The FBI initiated an investigation after receiving a tip that Laatsch offered to provide classified information because he disagreed with the current administration's values. Laatsch allegedly transcribed classified information into a notepad and hid it in his socks, later attempting to deliver the information via thumb drive to an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign emissary. Laatsch, who worked in the agency's Insider Threat Division, reportedly sought citizenship in the unnamed foreign country, expressing pessimism about the future of the United States. The investigation highlights concerns among intelligence officials about individuals exploiting disarray within the intel community to sell classified information.

          <p>An Alaskan man, Kell Morris, survived after being pinned face-down by a 700-pound boulder in a creek, thanks to his wife, Jo Roop, who held his head above water for three hours. The Seward Fire Department used air bags, ropes, and brute force to lift the boulder and pull him to safety. A volunteer with Seward Helicopter Tours transported firefighters to the scene, significantly reducing travel time. Morris was airlifted to a local hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

          <p>The United States Court of International Trade unanimously ruled against President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs, asserting that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited tariff authority. The court emphasized that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce. The ruling cited the "major-questions doctrine," requiring Congress to clearly authorize the executive branch for decisions of vast economic and political significance. The decision imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the IEEPA tariffs, though the administration has appealed the decision, the court ruling upholds the separation of powers and the rule of law.

The CDC still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children and all adults. The agency has not yet updated its immunization schedule to reflect the exclusion of pregnant women, as several pages of agency guidance still recommend vaccination due to their higher risk of severe disease.

The trend of skills-based hiring is increasing, with companies like JP Morgan Chase and Walmart prioritizing work experience over credentials.

          <p>President Donald Trump accused China of "totally violating" its preliminary trade agreement with the United States, suggesting potential retaliatory action. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer echoed Trump's concerns, stating that China is "slow rolling their compliance" with the temporary trade deal. The U.S. and China had previously agreed to a 90-day suspension on most tariffs imposed on each other's imports. Trump expressed frustration, claiming that China had stabilized its economy due to the deal but has now reneged on its commitments.
