          <p>Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Brickworks, two Australian investment firms, have announced a merger valued at A$14 billion ($9 billion), leading to a surge in their stock prices. The merger aims to create a new, larger company listed in Sydney, consolidating holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit. According to Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow, the deal simplifies the structure, adds scale, and enhances the company's investment profile. This move unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers but criticized for suppressing shareholder value and corporate transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has countered accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, asserting instead that the U.S. is undermining the deal's terms. Tensions have risen after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, as well as announcing visa revocations for Chinese students. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that these actions "seriously undermine" the Geneva agreement and vowed to take measures to protect China's interests. The U.S. government has continued to provoke new economic and trade frictions, increasing uncertainty in bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people and numerous injuries, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses claim that gunfire came from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli military denies its forces were involved. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reported delivering aid without incident and dismissed reports of mass casualties as false. Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have faltered, with both sides trading blame for the lack of progress.</p>

          <p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, anticipates that Nicolás Maduro will respond to U.S. restrictions on Chevron's operations by intensifying internal repression. Machado, who is in hiding, says the economic situation in Venezuela is unsustainable and irreversible. The economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean projects the Venezuelan economy will contract this year. She also claims that Maduro's allies lack the capacity to support the regime financially, and that recent legislative elections were a defeat for Maduro due to low voter turnout.</p>

The Competition and Markets Authority supports collaboration where possible in the challenging financial situation for the sector. Some universities are already delivering courses in collaboration, benefiting students, and increased clarity is needed to prevent isolated decisions about course closures.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing controversy over a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, sparking criticism from the U.S. and local political groups. The government asserts that compensation will be paid in most cases and that the law aims to increase black ownership of land. The law would only apply in rare circumstances for land needed for "public interest," such as land reform or accessing natural resources. Compensation rules are set to change, with owners likely to receive less money based on "just-and-equitable" compensation rather than "market value."</p>

Veterans advocates view this as censorship by the Trump administration. The article warned that cancelled contracts, layoffs and a planned staff reduction of 80,000 employees in the nation’s largest integrated healthcare system jeopardizes the health of a million veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
