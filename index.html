          <p>One of the two eaglets, Sunny, born to the famed bald eagle parents Jackie and Shadow in Big Bear, California, successfully took its first flight from the nest. The eaglet was seen perched on a branch before jumping off and flying away, marking a significant milestone in its development. While Sunny has left the nest, her sister Gizmo remains behind, with expectations that she will follow suit soon. The eaglets, now nearly 13 weeks old, are expected to remain in the area for a few months before venturing off on their own in the fall. The event has been eagerly anticipated by viewers of the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam, making it a joyous occasion for wildlife enthusiasts. The successful flight of Sunny represents a positive step in the life cycle of these majestic birds.</p>

          <p>British newspapers are leading with coverage of the government's Strategic Defence Review, highlighting a £2 billion investment in drones and the adoption of tactics from the war in Ukraine. The review also includes plans for 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and the possibility of a military "gap year" for over-18s. While some experts warn of potential tax increases to fund the increased spending, the Prime Minister has ruled out national service in favor of a paid military year for school-leavers. Several papers also feature the renewed search for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal in 2007, with German police searching multiple sites near the prime suspect's former home.</p>

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball, has died at the age of 89; he was a recipient of the People's Honor Award. Nagashima was a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, leading them to nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973. Known for his charismatic personality, Nagashima's popularity transcended sports, and he became a household name during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. His retirement in 1974 was a major news event, and his farewell speech remains a part of Japan's popular lexicon, marking the end of an era for baseball fans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a reversal from the administration's earlier announcement to resume collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. The pause provides older borrowers with defaulted student loans more time to address their debt and avoid reductions in their Social Security checks. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are currently in default and at risk of having their benefits reduced.</p>
