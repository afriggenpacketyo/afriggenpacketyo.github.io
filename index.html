          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced a national investigation into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The inquiry will urgently examine the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex, aiming to provide families with the truth and accountability they deserve. The investigation is set to commence this summer and is expected to deliver its findings by December 2025. This inquiry reflects the government's commitment to improving the quality and safety of maternity services across the country.</p>

          <p>An adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ali Shamkhani, stated that recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities would not halt Tehran's nuclear program. Shamkhani asserted that even if the facilities were completely destroyed, the enriched materials, local expertise, and political will would remain. He added that Iran retains the right to legitimate defense and hinted at future surprises, suggesting the country would continue to pursue its nuclear ambitions despite external pressures. This statement underscores the ongoing tensions in the region and Iran's determination to maintain its nuclear capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications has found a correlation between rising temperatures and an increased risk of sleep apnea. The study, which analyzed sleep data from over 125,000 people across 41 countries, revealed that the likelihood of experiencing sleep apnea problems increases by almost 50% when temperatures reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Severe cases of sleep apnea, where breathing stops more than 30 times per hour, also saw a 40% increase, with researchers suggesting that limited access to air conditioning in certain regions may exacerbate the issue. The findings underscore the broader impacts of climate change on public health, extending beyond immediate environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley expressed his shock and frustration regarding a planned protest in London in support of Palestine Action, describing the group as an "organised extremist criminal group." The protest is backed by 35 groups, including pro-Palestinian organisations and the Stop the War Coalition, and comes after Palestine Action activists broke into RAF Brize Norton. While acknowledging the right to protest, Sir Mark stated that actions supporting the group go beyond legitimate protest, but the Met has no legal power to prevent the protest until the group is proscribed.

The survey, conducted by the Forsa institute, found that 64% of respondents were in favor of the initiative, driven by concerns over the unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy. Support for a European deterrent was consistent across various demographic and political lines, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz signaling his intent to discuss the strategy with the United Kingdom and France.

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran is weighing its response, with its foreign minister condemning the strikes as a violation of international law. The U.S. military operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved multiple aircraft and precision-guided weapons targeting key nuclear sites. Republicans largely backed Trump's move, while Democrats expressed concerns about the lack of congressional approval. The administration is assessing the effectiveness of the strikes, and the potential for Iranian retaliation remains an open question.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to reshape the civil service by making it easier to fire federal workers, particularly those in "policy-influencing" positions. A proposed rule would allow the administration to move tens of thousands of civil servants into a new category of employees who would serve at the pleasure of the president. Critics warn that this politicizes the civil service and could undermine the expertise and independence of government employees. Concerns are also raised about the potential for political interference in data collection and reporting.</p>

          <p>As this year's NATO summit approaches, Europe is facing uncertainty about its alliance with the U.S., given an increasingly aggressive Russia and a potentially disengaged United States. The summit will focus on defense spending, with pressure on European members to increase their contributions to meet new targets. With the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East, Europe is realizing the need to step up its own security and defense commitments. The summit is about Europeans staying together, and the future of NATO as we've known it for the last 75 years is finished.</p>

While the administration claims GuantÃ¡namo is used for temporary transit and staging for removal, critics argue it is a tactic to frighten migrants into self-deportation.

          <p>There are indications that this year may be particularly active for ticks, as emergency care visits related to tick bites have increased since 2019. Ticks can transmit various disease-causing agents, making it crucial to take preventive measures, including frequent tick checks and using insect repellents. Risks vary by region, with Lyme disease being most common in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, while ehrlichiosis and spotted fever are more prevalent in the South. Prompt removal of ticks and awareness of local risks are essential for staying safe.</p>

Concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and weakening international demand for U.S. assets are expected to regain focus once the immediate crisis-driven demand fades. While fears of Iran retaliating, potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, initially boosted the dollar, analysts caution that the situation is more complex, with Iran having asymmetric capabilities to impact the region.
