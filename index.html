        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doordash recently revealed its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, signaling an expansion into restaurant management services. Despite this strategic move, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, leading to a slight dip in share value. Total orders saw an 18% increase year-over-year, aligning with analyst predictions, while net income significantly improved compared to the previous year. Doordash also highlighted growth in grocery delivery, especially in perishables, but acknowledged potential risks associated with its increasing international presence, such as geopolitical and currency fluctuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's conservative party, unexpectedly failed to secure a majority in the parliamentary vote for chancellor, a setback after winning the federal elections. Despite his coalition holding sufficient seats, a number of MPs dissented, leading to the unprecedented failure. The Bundestag now has a two-week window to elect Merz or another candidate, and while the Social Democrat SPD insists on coalition commitment, some suspect internal dissent. This failure undermines Merz's image as a stabilizing force and has drawn criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany party, as Germany's government handover faces uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Russia accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on Moscow, just days before a planned ceasefire coinciding with the WWII parade. Moscow's airports briefly shut down in response to the drone barrage, though no casualties were reported, and Ukraine has not commented on the situation. President Putin has called for a three-day ceasefire, but Ukraine seeks a longer truce with a halt to missile and drone strikes on civilian targets. Ukraine's foreign ministry urged foreign states to abstain from participating in the Moscow parade, deeming it disrespectful to Ukrainian soldiers who fought against Nazism.</p>

          <p>King Charles III unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, depicting the monarch in his coronation regalia. The portrait was much more positively received than his previous official portrait, which drew criticism for its predominantly red hues. Alongside the King's portrait, a second official portrait of Queen Camilla, painted by Paul Benney, was also revealed, showcasing the Queen in her coronation dress. Coronation portraits have been a traditional part of the crowning of a monarch for centuries, and these new portraits continue that tradition.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted that restricting winter fuel payments negatively affected Labour's support in recent local elections, with many voters expressing dissatisfaction. Despite this, he defended the move as necessary to invest in public services amidst economic challenges. Labour Welsh First Minister Baroness Eluned Morgan has urged the UK government to reconsider the policy, but Streeting maintained that a formal review is not underway. Former cabinet minister Louise Haigh criticized the cuts as a key reason voters feel Labour does not understand their priorities, calling for an economic reset.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by high demand for personalized vehicles. CEO Benedetto Vigna hailed it as a great start to the year, noting strong profitability due to product mix and personalization requests. However, Ferrari cautioned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU car imports could negatively impact profitability this year, potentially reducing margins by 50 basis points. The company had previously announced a 10% price increase on certain models in anticipation of the tariffs, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge against the U.S. dollar, driven by exporter conversions and insurer hedging activities. Experts suggest that the Taiwanese central bank's apparent lack of intervention fueled speculation about a currency realignment to gain trade advantages with the U.S. Governor Yang Chin-long denied currency negotiation claims but acknowledged intervention to curb excessive inflows. Analysts remain skeptical of meaningful central bank intervention, suggesting a potential shift in currency policy. The article indicates that the dollar demand by importers caused the pullback.</p>

Retailers are urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as inventory levels may become lean due to supply disruptions.

The Kremlin's efforts to indoctrinate children have taken root in most schools, including activities such as flag-raising ceremonies, discussions on family values, and lessons portraying Russia as a victim. While many Russians accept these lessons, a significant number are finding ways to avoid them, often with the tacit support of school administrators.</p>

The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment upon discharge from hospitals and jails, and adding supportive housing units and psychiatric beds. Cuomo's proposals align with some of Mayor Eric Adams's initiatives but have drawn criticism regarding his past reduction of psychiatric beds as governor. The plan would spend about $2.6 billion in capital funding over five years to build at least 600 additional units of supportive housing each year.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has pledged to "call out" the Labour government in Westminster when it "gets it wrong for Wales", prioritizing the nation's interests over party loyalty. She criticized cuts to disability benefits and the winter fuel allowance, demanding Wales benefit more from wind power and a fairer funding formula. Morgan attacked Reform UK and Plaid Cymru, urging voters not to take Labour's policies for granted. She argued that decisions suitable for England may not be right for Wales, using the analogy of the BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey.</p>

          <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) moved to drop its appeal of a federal judge's ruling allowing KalshiEx to take bets on U.S. political elections. The agreement calls for both sides to bear their own costs, and Kalshi's CEO, Tarek Mansour, hailed it as a historic moment for prediction markets. However, the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets criticized the decision, calling it a "stark betrayal of the public interest" and a threat to election integrity.

          <p>Executives from companies like Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands report that Hispanic consumers are cutting back on grocery spending, affecting North American sales. A contributing factor to the dip, some experts say, is fear around stricter immigration policy. While the Trump administration has deported fewer people than President Joe Biden's administration during the year-ago period, reports from Immigration and Customs Enforcement show it is holding 10% more detainees than it was under Biden. Constellation Brands, owner of Modelo and Corona, cited tariffs and concerns among Hispanic consumers as reasons for a weaker outlook, while Boston Beer also noted a similar decline. Keurig Dr Pepper's CEO mentioned fewer trips and lower spending per trip by Hispanic consumers.</p>

Critics argue that this approach won't solve affordability issues and may harm scientific research, while supporters, like Christopher Rufo, seek to discipline universities through financial pressure.</p>
