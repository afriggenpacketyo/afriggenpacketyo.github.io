          <h2>Reform UK Sees Gains in English Local Elections</h2>

          <p>Reform UK has significantly increased its presence in English local elections, establishing itself as a strong challenger to the main political parties in Britain. The party secured hundreds of seats across various councils, gaining control of several authorities previously held by the Conservatives, and also won a key Westminster by-election. Nigel Farage celebrated these results as proof that Reform has surpassed the Conservatives as the primary opposition to Labour. These elections marked the first major electoral test since Labour's landslide general election victory, and the Tories faced substantial losses while the Liberal Democrats and Greens also made gains, indicating a fragmentation of the British political landscape.</p>

          <p>Following recent English elections, Nigel Farage's Reform UK celebrated its gains with a fireworks display, while Labour and Conservative leaders are analyzing the results and writing post-mortems. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described her party's results as a "bloodbath," while Labour's Keir Starmer acknowledged voters' frustrations and the need for his party to act more decisively. The election outcomes raise questions about how the major parties will respond to the rise of Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party, as well as how Reform will handle the responsibilities of governing.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles due to a reservoir being shut down for repairs, and the city's failure to prepare an alternative reservoir in time. Emails show officials considered reviving a retired reservoir, but the plan was never completed due to safety concerns. Firefighters reported hydrants running dry as the fire burned, raising questions about the city's preparedness and water management. The inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the potential water supply in the area.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to cease withholding funds from Maine schools, marking a victory for the state after being targeted over its support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program after Maine refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration, leading to a settlement where the USDA will restore funds and refrain from interfering without following legal procedures. This resolves a dispute over alleged violations of Title IX.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked its enforcement. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which aimed to punish the firm for its representation of clients and progressive employment policies, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling supports Perkins Coie's assertion that Mr. Trump was using presidential power to retaliate against lawyers for their legal work. The judge noted the order was issued as "retribution" for Perkins Coie's work and Mr. Trump's "grievances."</p>

Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Current therapies require specific matching to the snake species, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies from his blood that target neurotoxins and, when combined with a drug, protected mice from lethal doses of various venomous snakes.</p>

          <p>Wall Street stocks rebounded after experiencing losses following President Trump's announcement of global tariffs. The tech sector led the gains, with Microsoft and Nvidia showing significant growth. The market's recovery was fueled by a better-than-expected jobs report and renewed hopes for US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, exceeding analysts' predictions and easing recession fears.</p>

          <p>Army Capt. Braden Trent has asserted that the Army's new 6.8x51mm XM7 service rifle suffers from reliability issues, excessive barrel wear, and component breakages, deeming it "unfit" for its intended purpose. Sig Sauer, the gun's manufacturer, has strongly refuted these claims. Trent presented his findings, based on his unclassified student thesis, at the Modern Day Marine exposition. The XM7 is part of the Armyâ€™s Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) family of systems and is intended to replace the M4A1 carbine.</p>

          <h2>Man's Blood Could Revolutionize Snakebite Treatment After Injecting Himself With Venom</h2>

          <p>Scientists have made a significant breakthrough in snakebite treatment by using antibodies from a man who injected himself with snake venom for years. Tim Friede, a self-taught snake expert, developed immunity to several neurotoxins after nearly 18 years of exposure. Researchers isolated antibodies from his blood and created an antivenom that protects against bites from 19 species of poisonous snakes in mice. This new approach could revolutionize snakebite treatment by offering a more effective and safer alternative to traditional antivenoms.</p>
