          <p>The UK economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction and defying forecasts of slight growth. This decline was primarily driven by a drop in manufacturing output and weak retail sales, presenting a challenge to the government's economic priorities. Despite the monthly downturn, the economy did show a 0.5% growth over the three-month period ending in May. Business groups have expressed concern over the ongoing pressures facing various sectors of the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This incident follows a history of drownings in the area, prompting renewed warnings from emergency services about water safety.

          <p>Novak Djokovic has raised concerns about his fitness ahead of his Wimbledon semifinal match against world number one Jannik Sinner by canceling a scheduled practice session. The 38-year-old champion had an awkward fall during his quarter-final victory and has acknowledged the increasing physical demands of competing at the highest level. His opponent, Jannik Sinner, has also been dealing with an elbow injury, adding another layer of uncertainty to the highly anticipated matchup. While Sinner stated he would be 100% fit, Djokovic's last-minute cancellation casts some doubt on his physical condition for the upcoming clash.</p>

          <p>The OPEC International Seminar took place at Vienna's Hofburg palace, bringing together energy ministers, CEOs, and industry leaders to discuss the oil market, investment, and the energy transition. The high-profile event, led by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, served as a key gathering for the global energy sector. However, the conference was met with protests outside the palace, with demonstrators calling for an oil embargo and action related to the conflict in Gaza. The event highlighted the complex intersection of energy policy, global politics, and public dissent.</p>

          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof on his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by the local council. His architects argued the current lead roof was "beyond repair" and that a modern replacement was necessary to prevent water damage and deter theft. However, Perth and Kinross Council ruled that the proposed single-ply membrane material would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character. The actor, who purchased the ten-bedroom villa in 2023, had previously received approval for other renovations on the property.</p>

The ban, which prohibits using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens or washing cars, comes with a potential fine of up to £1,000.

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin layoffs, aiming to reduce its domestic staff by approximately 15%, or about 1,800 positions. The cuts are part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration to streamline the department and will involve a combination of layoffs and voluntary departures. Officials state the goal is to eliminate redundant departments and non-core functions, consolidating offices like those handling sanctions. Critics and some department staff have expressed alarm, arguing the move could undermine American diplomatic efforts and demoralize the workforce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's F-35 stealth jet program is being undermined by delays, personnel shortages, and infrastructure issues, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO). The spending watchdog noted a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion invested so far, with the fleet's full mission capability falling far short of targets. Furthermore, the NAO estimates the total cost to expand the fleet will be significantly higher than the Ministry of Defence's forecast. While the F-35 is a technologically superior aircraft, these persistent problems are compromising the UK's overall warfighting capability.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has reported that there are "reasonable grounds" to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity are currently being committed in Sudan's Darfur region. An ICC probe found disturbing evidence, including targeted sexual violence against women and girls from specific ethnic groups, amid the ongoing civil war. The conflict between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has led to devastating civilian casualties, a worsening famine, and the targeted disruption of humanitarian aid. The ICC's deputy prosecutor described the depth of suffering as immense and warned the situation could still deteriorate further.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have accused a prominent Georgia Republican, Brant Frost IV, of running a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded about 300 investors out of at least $140 million. A civil lawsuit filed by the SEC alleges that his company, First Liberty Building and Loan, lied about its business and instead used new investor money to pay earlier ones. Frost is alleged to have personally misappropriated over $19 million for personal expenses, including jewelry and political contributions. The collapse of the firm has sent shockwaves through the local networks from which it drew investors. (not investment advice)</p>

OpenAI claims its investigation linked the group's listed leader to a property owned by an LLC named "Tesla Place."

Concerns about potential discrimination, gun violence, and actions by the Trump administration were cited more frequently than costs as deterrents.
