          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has announced the launch of a distributed cryptography system integrating Quantum Key Distribution and Post-Quantum Cryptography, claiming it's unhackable even by quantum computers. The system aims to provide end-to-end quantum-secure architecture for real-time communication, data protection, and trusted identity authentication. Peng Chengzhi, chief quantum scientist at China Telecom, noted that traditional public key-based encryption systems face increasing threats as quantum computing advances. The company also completed a cross-regional quantum-encrypted phone call between Beijing and Hefei using this system, marking a significant step in quantum-resistant cybersecurity.

Pence emphasized Qatar's history of "playing both sides" and suggested that accepting such a lavish gift would be inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. He proposed that Qatar should instead invest the $400 million in infrastructure on U.S. military bases. Trump defended the potential acceptance by citing delays at Boeing and stated that the aircraft would be formally given to the U.S. Department of Defense and eventually transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation.
