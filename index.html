          <p>Actor Sacha Baron Cohen has surprised fans by revealing a significantly more muscular physique in a photoshoot for Men's Fitness UK. The transformation is in preparation for his role as the villain Mephisto in Marvel's upcoming miniseries, "Ironheart." Cohen humorously commented on his new look on social media, joking about his methods and debuting a new character persona of a middle-aged man focused on fitness. The reveal comes amid personal changes for the actor, following his recent divorce from Isla Fisher and public disputes with actress Rebel Wilson over on-set conduct allegations.</p>

          <p>The number of job postings mentioning artificial intelligence has surged, according to a report from the Brookings Institution, indicating a growing demand for AI-skilled workers. Over the past year, AI-themed job listings have more than doubled as companies increasingly integrate the technology into their operations. These roles range from specialized AI engineers to more general positions in software development, consulting, and ethics. While currently a small fraction of the overall labor market, these jobs often command higher salaries, with AI skills correlating to an average pay increase of 28%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields was carted off the practice field after sustaining a toe injury during a team drill at training camp. The injury occurred on his fifth play, and he was immediately attended to by trainers before being transported for further evaluation. Coach Aaron Glenn stated the injury was to Fields' right foot but had no immediate details on its severity, speculating that another player may have stepped on it. The incident raises concerns for the Jets, as Fields was signed to be the team's starter, with veteran Tyrod Taylor now stepping in as the primary backup.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, known worldwide as the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71 following a cardiac arrest. Hogan was a central figure in the rise of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) during the 1980s, popularizing the sport globally through his "Hulkamania" persona and later venturing into film and television. In recent years, he became a controversial figure, notably winning a major lawsuit against Gawker Media that led to its bankruptcy and aligning himself with right-wing politics. His death marks the end of an era for many who grew up with his larger-than-life character.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant jump, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge followed the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and gained traction among retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The stock is a candidate for such volatile trading due to its high short interest, with over 13% of its shares being bet against by institutional investors. This activity provides a temporary boost for the company's stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date prior to the rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's Inspector General has reportedly found evidence that encrypted Signal messages from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's account contained details from a classified email. According to senior officials, the messages, which were sent to a group of Trump administration officials, detailed a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen. The original information was allegedly from an email marked "SECRET//NOFORN," indicating it was not to be shared with foreign nationals. The Pentagon's spokesperson has denied that any classified information was shared, maintaining the department's previous statements on the matter while the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that the social media app TikTok will "go dark" in the United States unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to a deal that gives Americans control over its technology and algorithm. This ultimatum comes as the deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations approaches on September 17. The U.S. government passed a law demanding the sale due to national security concerns over potential data access and content manipulation by the Chinese government. The definitive statement from Lutnick clarifies the administration's hardline stance on the app's future.</p>

          <p>An intense heat dome that has brought scorching temperatures to the central U.S. is now moving eastward, placing over 130 million Americans under heat alerts. Forecasters predict temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average, with many areas experiencing feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The prolonged heat in the Midwest has been exacerbated by a phenomenon known as "corn sweat," where moisture released from corn crops increases humidity. This process can add up to ten degrees to the heat index, intensifying the oppressive conditions for residents in the region.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted that CEOs of major American auto companies are "cool with" a new trade deal with Japan, despite criticism from their industry's policy group. The deal sets a 15% tariff on cars imported from Japan, which is lower than the 25% tariff on vehicles U.S. companies import from their own plants in Canada and Mexico. Lutnick dismissed complaints that this gives Japanese automakers an unfair advantage, arguing that U.S. companies can avoid the tariffs by moving manufacturing to America. The deal has caused concern for Detroit's Big Three, which face significant financial impacts from the existing tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland's government has announced plans to extend temporary police checks at its borders with Germany and Lithuania beyond the initial 30-day period. The controls were reintroduced in early July in response to similar measures by Germany, as several EU nations in the Schengen Area grapple with concerns over irregular migration. Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak stated the extension was certain, citing the weaponization of migration by Russia and Belarus. Since the checks began, Polish border guards have reportedly refused entry to over 100 people attempting to cross irregularly from Germany and Lithuania.</p>

          <p>AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, known as "the godfather of AI," are warning that a simple "kill switch" will not be a viable solution to control a future superintelligent AI. As AI systems become more integrated and intelligent, their power will lie in persuasion, not just physical control, making them difficult to simply unplug. Experts argue that any attempt to shut down a globally distributed AI, such as by bombing data centers or using an EMP, would cause a catastrophic collapse of civilization's critical infrastructure. The focus, they suggest, must be on instilling benevolent values in AI during its development.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California to dismantle parts of Proposition 12, a state law requiring cage-free conditions for farm animals. The lawsuit specifically targets the law's provisions on eggs, which the administration partially blames for high egg prices nationwide. However, agricultural economists argue that the primary driver of soaring egg prices is a widespread bird flu outbreak that has decimated the nation's hen population, not cage-free laws. Critics suggest the lawsuit is a political maneuver to support the pork industry, which strongly opposes the law's similar requirements for pigs.</p>
