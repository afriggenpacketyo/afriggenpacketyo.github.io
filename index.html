          <p>The Trump administration has announced the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to large-scale protests following ICE operations. President Trump cited the inability of California's Governor and Los Angeles' Mayor to manage the situation as justification for federal intervention. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local authorities are capable of handling the situation. The use of Title 10 authority waives the Posse Comitatus Act, allowing the military to assist in law enforcement. The situation remains tense, with ongoing clashes between protesters and authorities. </p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on whether to halve the time required to apply for citizenship, a move that has polarized the country. The referendum proposes cutting the wait time from 10 years to five, aligning Italy with most other European nations. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open". Supporters argue the reform would benefit long-term foreign residents who contribute to the country, while opponents claim it would dilute Italian identity. </p>
