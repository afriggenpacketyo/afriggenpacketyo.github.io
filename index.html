          <h2>Gold's Safe Haven Status Strengthens Amid Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 03:02:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices are surging as investors seek safe havens amid trade turmoil, particularly due to President Trump's trade policies, leading to a sell-off in U.S. Treasurys and the dollar. Analysts attribute this shift to waning trust in the U.S. economy and its assets, with gold's independence from monetary policy boosting its appeal. The traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down, with gold's inflation-hedging quality making it attractive as tariffs are expected to raise inflation in the U.S. Gold's lack of credit risk and independence from any single nation's trajectory further enhance its allure, especially during times of uncertainty.

          <p>China has updated its market access negative list, reducing the number of sectors that restrict or prohibit investment or operation by private firms, according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The latest list features 106 restricted areas, down from 117 in the previous version issued in 2022, signaling a further liberalization of the business environment for private enterprises. The update includes the elimination of national-level restrictions in certain sectors, partial liberalization in others, and the abolition of local-level restrictions in sectors where protectionism is deeply entrenched. The list also strengthens regulatory oversight in emerging fields such as the operation of auto-driving aircraft and the sale of novel tobacco products.</p>

          <p>European officials are expressing optimism about reaching a trade deal with the U.S. President Trump, but warn that tariffs would significantly harm both economies. Negotiations are ongoing to avoid U.S. tariffs on EU goods and EU countermeasures, but talks have not yet yielded tangible compromises. The EU insists that its trade in goods and services with the U.S. is reasonably balanced, with machinery, vehicles, and pharmaceuticals comprising the largest chunk of EU exports to the U.S. The IMF has also warned that Trump's tariffs pose major headwinds for the U.S. and global economy in 2025.</p>

          <p>An ant smuggling ring has been uncovered in Kenya, with two Belgian teenagers arrested for wildlife trafficking of queen ants destined for Europe and Asia. The seized ants, valued at potentially $1 million on European markets, are highly sought after by ant enthusiasts who maintain colonies in formicariums. Experts warn that the illegal trade threatens Kenya's wildlife ecosystem, as queen ants are vital for colony survival. The case highlights a shift in biopiracy trends from large mammals to lesser-known species, prompting concerns about organized crime syndicates diversifying their targets.</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. While revenue rose 42% year-on-year, the company cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policy, creating demand volatility in the second half of the year. Despite concerns about tariffs, SK Hynix anticipates limited impact on its AI server demand, with consumer electronics benefiting from new AI functionalities.

Measures are being taken to minimize the impact on the expo by scaling down work during peak visitor days and delaying heavy machinery operations until after the event concludes.

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on a bribery charge, becoming the latest ex-leader to face a criminal trial in a country with a history of investigating former presidents. The charge is connected to the employment of his former son-in-law at a now-defunct small budget airline in Thailand, with prosecutors alleging that the son-in-law received illicit salary and housing allowances from the airline. Prosecutors consider the money a bribe paid to Moon by a South Korean businessman who controlled the airline, as a favor to Moonâs family despite the son-in-law not being qualified for the job.</p>

          <p>An economist warns that the odds of a US recession are as high as 60% in the coming year due to President Trump's tariff policies. Indicators such as an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and prediction market data suggest an increased risk of economic downturn. While official recession indicators like the Sahm rule do not yet signal a recession, early measures of economic activity, such as purchasing managers' indices and retail sales data, are showing signs of weakness. The official arbiter of US recessions, the NBER, typically declares a turning point well after the fact.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for using the commercial messaging app Signal on a computer in his Pentagon office, where personal cellphones are restricted. This setup allowed him to communicate more easily in a building with poor cell service, according to sources. The Defense Secretary has two computers in his office, one for personal use and one that is government-issued, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Hegseth had cables installed in early March so that he could connect a private computer to Signal, according to a second person with knowledge of the matter.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on charges of bribery related to his former son-in-law's job at an airline. Prosecutors argue his former son-in-law, had little experience in the aviation industry but was hired in exchange for the airline's CEO leading a state-funded agency. The indictment comes amid a series of prosecutions against officials in his administration, with the Democratic Party condemning the prosection, calling it a "politically motivated move aimed at humiliating a former president". The residence of Moon Da-hye, the former president's daughter, was raided last September during investigations of the bribery allegations.</p>
