          <h2>Chinese Study Finds Weight Regain Common After Stopping Obesity Drugs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 06:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Peking University People’s Hospital indicates that patients who stop using anti-obesity medications, such as GLP-1 drugs, experience significant weight regain. The research, published in BMC Medicine, observed that weight started returning just eight weeks after treatment ceased and continued to increase over 20 weeks. These findings underscore the challenge of maintaining weight loss after discontinuing such medications. The article suggests that this highlights the necessity for developing and implementing long-term treatment strategies for obesity in clinical practice to ensure lasting results for patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on the legality of President Trump's tariffs, which were imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The lawsuit, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, argues the tariffs are an overreach of executive power, a claim strengthened by the Supreme Court's 'major questions doctrine.' This legal battle unfolds as the U.S. faces rising inflation, partly attributed to these tariffs, and the threat of new levies on more trading partners. The court's decision will likely determine how quickly the Supreme Court must weigh in on the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>European Commission Proposes Tripling ETIAS Travel Authorization Fee</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 05:59:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has announced a proposal to nearly triple the fee for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), from 7 euros to 20 euros. Set to be implemented in late 2026, this authorization is required for visa-exempt travelers from 59 countries, including the U.S. and U.K., for short stays. The commission cited inflation and operational costs for the increase, aligning the price with similar systems in the U.S. and U.K. The proposal is now under a two-month review by the European Council and Parliament, with exemptions remaining for travelers under 18 or over 70.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has initiated a new sanctions regime targeting people-smugglers, freezing the UK assets of 25 individuals and one company and banning them from traveling to the country. The targets include suspected gang leaders and suppliers of small boats used for crossing the English Channel, such as a Chinese manufacturer of inflatable boats. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move a 'landmark moment' in the fight against irregular migration. However, some experts, like those at Oxford University's Migration Observatory, believe the impact may be limited due to the vast scale of smuggling networks.</p>

          <p>The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its athlete safety policy to align with a presidential executive order, effectively banning transgender women from competing in women's Olympic events. The policy change, which follows President Trump's order titled 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,' requires national governing bodies to update their rules accordingly. Critics, including the National Women's Law Center, have condemned the move as discriminatory and politically motivated. The decision deepens the ongoing debate over transgender athlete participation and aligns with similar restrictions recently implemented by sports federations like swimming and cycling.</p>

          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging Libor interest rates quashed by the Supreme Court after a decade-long legal fight. They were among 19 traders jailed in the UK and US for manipulating the key inter-bank lending rate, but have always maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for what was then normal commercial practice. The ruling represents a significant vindication for the traders and a setback for the Serious Fraud Office, which will not seek a retrial. This decision follows US courts overturning all American convictions in 2022 for the same scandal.</p>

The article laments the loss of a shared public square where a host like Colbert could validate the public's perception of political absurdity.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has implemented new security directives that increase scrutiny on research collaborations involving noncitizens, particularly from nations like China, Russia, and Iran. The policy requires USDA-funded researchers to disclose foreign contracts and has already led to the dismissal of 70 noncitizen researchers. While the USDA states these measures are necessary to secure the nation's food supply and agricultural research, scientists express concern. Critics argue the new rules will stifle innovation, disrupt important international collaborations on global issues like food safety, and negatively impact the careers of many foreign-born scientists in the U.S.</p>

          <p>As heat waves intensify, the strategy of 'precooling' a home by significantly lowering the thermostat during off-peak hours is gaining attention, but its effectiveness is debated. Some experts and utility companies endorse the idea, suggesting it can save money if the home is well-insulated. However, others, like power company Exelon, warn it could lead to excessive energy use and higher costs. A professor of architecture notes that while it can work with caveats, a more reliable method is to maintain a consistent temperature, as air conditioners use significant energy to cool a room that is already hot.</p>

This dissatisfaction has led to what is described as a 'tax rebellion of the common man.'

          <p>A new genetic study of 9,000-year-old skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey has provided strong evidence of a society centered around women. Researchers analyzing DNA from remains buried under the same houses found that individuals were often related through their mother's side. This suggests a matrilocal system, where men moved in with their female partner's family, a contrast to the more common patrilocal systems of later history. The findings confirm long-held archaeological suspicions based on female figurines found at the site and offer a rare glimpse into the social structures of one of the world's oldest settlements.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 'massive' trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff rate on Japanese exports to the U.S., a significant reduction from the previous 25% on automobiles. The agreement is also set to open Japan's markets to American goods, including cars, rice, and other agricultural products, and involves a reported $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. economy. The deal was hailed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and caused Japanese auto stocks to surge, providing a potential political boost for his leadership amid domestic challenges.

Despite her actions leading to the coach's arrest, she was dropped from the national team and has since been caught in what her lawyers call a 'maze of internal legal processes' with basketball's governing body, FIBA. A recent decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled it lacked jurisdiction, sending the case back to FIBA's ethics panel.

The report highlights that China added approximately ten times more power capacity than the U.S. last year, a disparity described as 'concerning.' As the AI sector's energy demands are projected to grow exponentially, Anthropic urges Washington to streamline regulations and 'slash red tape' around power infrastructure projects. This energy gap is identified as a critical new front in the escalating technological competition between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, with core inflation also unchanged at 0.6%. These soft figures came in below economists' expectations and provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease its monetary policy. The central bank has noted that inflation has eased significantly this year and expects domestic growth to be 'subdued' due to a softening global economic outlook. An easing of policy could help support the country's export-dependent economy in the face of growing global trade uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
