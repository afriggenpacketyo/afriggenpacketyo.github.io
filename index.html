          <p>Increasing espionage accusations between China and the Philippines risk escalating tensions and impacting their economic ties.  China announced the arrest of suspected Philippine spies, while the Philippines has also reported numerous arrests of Chinese nationals on similar charges.  These incidents follow a pattern of escalating tensions in the South China Sea.  Experts warn that the situation could deter Chinese investment in the Philippines and further strain bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies applied for a patent on ternary logic for integrated circuits, potentially improving AI chip design and mitigating US sanctions.  Ternary logic, using a three-state system (-1, 0, 1), could reduce transistor count and energy consumption.  The patent application comes as advanced chip designs approach physical limits.  It remains unclear if this technology can be commercially viable on a large scale.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have caused significant disruption in European markets, with varying impacts across sectors. Luxury goods, food and beverage manufacturers, and automakers are among the hardest hit, facing increased costs and potential sales declines.

While some European currencies strengthened, the overall economic outlook remains negative, with forecasts suggesting a slowdown in growth and increased trade tensions.
