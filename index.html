          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday after failing to reach an agreement with the agency over pay raises, leading to a complete shutdown of train service and significant disruptions for over 300,000 daily commuters. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy expressed disappointment and urged engineers to return to the negotiating table, while NJ Transit implemented a contingency plan involving enhanced bus service and park-and-ride locations, although it can only accommodate a fraction of the typical train ridership. The strike impacts Metro-North's west-of-Hudson service as well, and NYC Emergency Management is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate traffic issues, but rail tickets will not be accepted on other carriers. The last NJ Transit strike occurred in 1983 and lasted three weeks.</p>

          <p>New college graduates are encountering a more competitive job market than anticipated, with unemployment rates rising to 5.8% in March, up from 4.6% the previous year. Factors contributing to this challenging landscape include federal hiring freezes, mass firings of government workers, and uncertainty stemming from tariff policies and the potential impact of artificial intelligence. Experts advise graduates to maintain a positive mindset and explore opportunities at smaller firms, which may offer better growth prospects. A survey indicated that 62% of the Class of 2025 are concerned about AI's impact on jobs, with graduates in the humanities and computer science being the most worried.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has proposed to the European Commission to sell its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites without the Teams workplace communication app in an effort to resolve antitrust concerns.

Microsoft's commitments include offering versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 without Teams at a reduced price, allowing customers to switch to tools without Teams, and increasing interoperability for Teams' competitors.

          <p>Valeria Márquez, a 23-year-old social media influencer, was murdered during a TikTok livestream in Jalisco, Mexico; prosecutors believe she was killed by hired assassins.

The Jalisco New Generation Cartel controls the region, and authorities are investigating if the murder is connected to a former congressman's death.

          <p>Experts say that appealing your property taxes may secure 'several years of savings.' A tax assessment determines the value of your property for tax purposes, but it is not uncommon for properties to be over-assessed due to inaccuracies. To appeal, homeowners should first check the accuracy of their assessment, compare their property to neighbors' homes, and see if they qualify for tax exemptions. If you plan to appeal your taxes, your goal is to demonstrate how the assessor is incorrectly applying the assessment formula to your house. </p>

This change means over 12 million people are believed to have experienced domestic abuse since age 16, up from 10 million previously. The new data reveals that 18% of adults have suffered emotional abuse and 12% economic abuse. A report from MPs calls for better data on violence against women and girls (VAWG) to improve support services and reduce violence.</p>

          <p>Arab Gulf states are vying for President Trump's favor with opulent receptions and significant economic commitments during his visit to the region. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange," Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and the UAE committed to a $1.4 trillion investment framework. While the realism of these numbers is questioned, the Gulf states aim to strengthen ties with the U.S. and secure access to advanced technologies. The visit showcased the region's wealth and its willingness to spend to advance its economic agendas.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of lawmakers has urged Japan's Defense Ministry to establish an office dedicated to investigating UFOs, formally referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). The proposal, presented to the defense chief, emphasizes the need to address UAP as realistic and serious national security concerns. The group advocates for a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which would regularly report to parliament, disclose information to the public, and conduct scientific analysis of collected data.</p>

He urges Democrats to embrace generational change through competitive primaries and a more combative posture toward Donald Trump. Hogg plans to spend millions to unseat Democrats he deems "asleep at the wheel" in safe blue districts, but his project has faced internal opposition within the DNC. He emphasizes the need for the party to show people an alternative vision for the future.</p>

          <p>China's military has cautioned that the US Space Force's plan to deploy "orbital carriers" could accelerate an arms race in space. A People's Liberation Army Daily commentary cited a US$60 million contract awarded by the US Space Force to develop an orbital transport craft, arguing it would intensify military rivalry and threaten space security. The PLA Daily commentary cited design specifications suggesting the craft included hard-points for weapons and could carry up to 10,000kg (22,046lbs) of payload within a 60-cubic metre (2,119-cubic feet) compartment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's 25% tariff on imported cars is causing concern about General Motors' (GM) future in South Korea, where it produces budget SUVs almost exclusively for the U.S. market. Unlike Hyundai and Kia, GM relies heavily on exports to the U.S., making it particularly vulnerable to the tariffs. Experts suggest that the tariffs could lead GM to reduce its operations or exit South Korea altogether, while the labor union expresses concerns about the company's long-term commitment. The future of GM's operations depends on ongoing tariff talks between the U.S. and South Korea.</p>

USC also did away with naming a valedictorian for this year, opting instead for a student speaker chosen from essay submissions. The event featured a drone show and fireworks, a hit from last year's replacement celebration, but the changes drew mixed reactions from students and alumni.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of Trump vs. CASA Inc., focusing on whether lower-court federal judges have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions. The article argues that lower courts do not have this power and that the ability to decide the law of the land should not rest with them. The author emphasizes that in our system of governance, it is only the named parties to a given lawsuit that can truly be bound by a lower court’s judgment. The author concludes that nationwide injunctions offend the very core of our constitutional order.</p>

The birds use their L-shaped beaks, head-bobbing, and webbed feet to create tiny tornadoes that trap shrimp, algae, and other food particles. This research could potentially inspire new water filtration techniques. The study emphasizes the constant mysteries in science, especially with such bizarre birds as flamingos.</p>
