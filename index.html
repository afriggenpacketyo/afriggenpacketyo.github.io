        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Colorado mother and influencer, Kyana Miner, is offering advice on how families can save money on skiing and snowboarding trips. She recommends taking advantage of programs like the Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack and the Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which offer free or significantly reduced access for children. Miner also suggests booking packages, skiing on weekdays, visiting smaller resorts, and renting gear for children until they are teenagers to make the winter sport more financially accessible. Planning and booking these passes and trips early in the season is crucial for securing the best prices.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed regret over appointing Peter Mandelson as his US ambassador, stating he would have never made the appointment had he known the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The decision to sack Lord Mandelson came after leaked emails revealed supportive messages he sent to Epstein following a 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Starmer asserted that the content of the emails, which showed Mandelson questioning the conviction, was fundamentally at odds with his government's stance on violence against women and girls.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a former federal prosecutor and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has filed a lawsuit alleging her termination from the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York was unlawful. The suit claims she was fired without cause or due process, suggesting the decision was politically motivated due to her father's contentious relationship with President Donald Trump. Comey, who prosecuted high-profile cases involving figures like Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, is seeking reinstatement and back pay, arguing that career prosecutors must be able to work without fear of political reprisal.</p>

          <p>Paul Ovenden, a senior political strategy aide to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has resigned after offensive text messages he sent eight years ago regarding veteran MP Diane Abbott were made public. In the messages, Ovenden recounted a graphic and sexually explicit conversation among colleagues about Abbott. In his resignation statement, Ovenden expressed deep regret for the comments and stated he was stepping down to avoid distracting from the government's work. The incident adds to recent turmoil in Downing Street, following the sacking of the US ambassador and the resignation of the deputy prime minister.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Trymaine Lee discusses his new memoir, "A Thousand Ways to Die," which examines the profound impact of covering gun violence in America, particularly within Black communities. After suffering a near-fatal heart attack, Lee confronted the immense stress and trauma accumulated from years of reporting on stories of death and survival that mirrored his own identity. The book traces the history of firearms in Black America, recounts his personal experiences, and serves as a plea for recognizing the humanity of victims.

          <p>China's market regulator has preliminarily found that U.S. chipmaker Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly laws, and the investigation will continue. The probe relates to Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Israeli tech company Mellanox and the conditions attached to that deal's approval by Beijing. This development adds to growing technological tensions between the two nations, occurring as trade talks begin and shortly after China launched separate probes into U.S. chip restrictions. Nvidia stated it complies with all laws and will continue to cooperate with government agencies as its stock saw a decline in premarket trading. (not investment advice)</p>

Piker's live reaction to the shooting highlighted the shock and the dangerous potential for retaliatory violence fueled by online rhetoric.

According to court records, over a million borrowers are caught in a backlog for IDR applications, with tens of thousands more awaiting decisions on PSLF.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, financial experts are highlighting common mistakes that make this debt more expensive. Paying a bill late can trigger immediate fees and cause interest to accrue on new purchases without a grace period. Carrying a balance from month to month allows interest to compound daily, rapidly increasing the total amount owed and potentially harming one's credit score. Finally, failing to utilize strategies like 0% balance transfers or debt consolidation loans means missing opportunities to significantly reduce interest payments and pay down principal faster.

The idea echoes a similar push from his first term and aligns with arguments made by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the unhealthy focus on quarterly guidance.

While renewables have high initial capital costs, their operational expenses are very low.

Key recommendations include aggressively paying down high-interest debt like credit cards, as a small rate cut will not significantly reduce the burden of existing high APRs. Savers are encouraged to lock in high yields now with CDs or high-yield savings accounts before rates fall. The lower rate environment could also benefit the housing market by making mortgages more affordable, and improving one's credit score remains the most effective way to secure the best loan terms.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Monday, U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF), a move indicating some temporary tightness in the financial system's liquidity. The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large settlement of Treasury securities, which increased the demand for cash. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding squeezes by allowing banks to exchange eligible collateral, like Treasuries, for overnight cash. Analysts suggest the pressure is incremental and typical for such payment deadlines, rather than a sign of a broader systemic issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have provided a detailed overview of the investigation into the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was taken into custody after his father recognized him in photos released by law enforcement and urged him to surrender. Investigators believe Robinson acted alone in what they describe as a targeted attack, firing a single shot from a high-powered rifle from a nearby building's roof. While a motive is still under investigation, officials noted that Robinson had become more political in recent years and may have left messages on the social media platform Discord.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Letter to NATO Allies Urging Halt to Russian Energy Purchases Unlikely to Shift EU Policy</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump published a letter urging NATO allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas, threatening sanctions on Russia only after they comply. However, policy experts in Brussels believe the letter is unlikely to change the European Union's course. The EU has already significantly reduced its reliance on Russian energy, with Hungary and Slovakia being the main holdouts—two countries whose leaders are friendly with Trump. Analysts suggest Trump's demand sets an impossibly high bar for U.S. action, effectively shifting blame to European allies for his administration's continued inaction on imposing tougher sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a number of individuals across the U.S. have been fired or disciplined by their employers for public comments about his death. Those affected include a sports reporter, a university employee, a Nasdaq staffer, and an MSNBC analyst, among others, who made remarks seen as insensitive or celebratory. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate at-will employees for public statements that could harm the business's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents have ignited a debate over free speech, political violence, and professional consequences in a polarized society.</p>

Administrators state that while there is interest from potential buyers for some of the 85 remaining stores, it is no longer viable to operate the others due to stock shortages and high operating costs.</p>

          <p>Police in the Virgin Islands have released new CCTV footage showing what is believed to be the last sighting of Sarm Heslop, a British woman who vanished four years ago. The video shows Heslop and her then-boyfriend, Ryan Bane, walking on a dock before boarding a dinghy to return to his yacht. Bane, who has been named a person of interest but never formally questioned, claimed she disappeared overnight, likely falling overboard. The release of the footage, part of a new BBC documentary, highlights a potential one-hour discrepancy in the timeline Bane provided to authorities, deepening the mystery surrounding her disappearance.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Hamas leaders will not have immunity "wherever they are," refusing to rule out further strikes against them. His comments came during a press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, following an Israeli attack in Qatar last week that targeted Hamas leadership. The strike drew international criticism, including from the U.S., as Qatar is a key ally and mediator in the region. Netanyahu asserted that Israel conducted the operation alone and that every nation has the right to defend itself beyond its borders.</p>

          <p>American runner and Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker was disqualified from his semi-final race at the world championships for "jostling." During the home stretch, Hocker was boxed in on the inside lane and pushed his way through a narrow gap, making physical contact with Germany's Robert Farken. Although Hocker finished second and would have advanced, officials ruled that his maneuver provided an unfair advantage and disrupted another athlete. An appeal filed by the U.S. team was subsequently rejected, ending Hocker's run at the championships.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares on the open market, his first such buy since 2020. The move was interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, causing Tesla's stock to jump more than 6%. This purchase comes as Musk has sought greater control of the company, demanding a 25% stake to focus on its future in AI and robotics. The investment follows a period of struggling sales for Tesla amid increased competition and the end of some U.S. tax breaks for electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Phillip Swagel, the director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), stated that President Donald Trump's tariffs appear to have contributed to higher inflation than initially anticipated by his office. This view contrasts with some Wall Street analyses that have yet to see significant price hikes materialize from the levies. Swagel also noted that the CBO projects the tariffs will reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade through increased revenue and averted debt costs. The long-term future of the tariffs remains uncertain, pending a Supreme Court hearing on the matter in November. (not investment advice)</p>
