            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced its intention to appeal a federal judge's order that requires the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, who was wrongly deported. Simultaneously, the DOJ released documents purportedly linking Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang, basing the alleged affiliation on his clothing and information from a confidential informant. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and wife deny his gang membership, questioning the validity of the evidence. The case has drawn scrutiny due to conflicting assessments regarding Abrego Garcia's fear of returning to El Salvador and the alleged gang affiliation's geographic inconsistencies.</p>

            <p>Grant Shapps, the former UK defence minister, has expressed his strong disapproval of Donald Trump's favorable attitude towards Russia and Vladimir Putin. Shapps criticized Trump's description of a deadly Russian missile strike in Ukraine as a "mistake," calling it "weasel language" reminiscent of the IRA terrorist group. He emphasized the need for moral clarity in condemning Putin's actions and warned that appeasing dictators could embolden other autocrats with territorial ambitions. Shapps suggested that Putin might have some form of leverage over Trump, pointing to the former president's impeachment for withholding aid to Ukraine.</p>

He also states that his written answers were edited without his consent, and he was prevented from presenting his research at a conference.

            <p>China is moving away from retaliatory tariffs on goods in its trade conflict with the U.S., opting instead for measures targeting the American services sector and other non-tariff restrictions. This shift comes after U.S. President Donald Trump significantly increased tariffs on select Chinese goods. China's actions include tightening export controls on rare-earth minerals, initiating antitrust probes into American companies, and restricting Chinese airlines from taking deliveries of Boeing jets. These measures signal a broader decoupling of the two economies and create new challenges for U.S. businesses operating in China.</p>

            <p>Michelle Trachtenberg, known for her roles in Gossip Girl and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, died from complications related to diabetes, according to the New York City medical examiner. The 39-year-old actress was found dead at her home in February, and initial reports listed her death as "undetermined." Trachtenberg had reportedly received a liver transplant recently. Her family had initially objected to a post-mortem examination, but the medical examiner's office amended the cause of death after reviewing laboratory test results.</p>

            <p>Japan's export growth missed expectations in March, rising by only 3.9% compared to the previous year, signaling the impact of tariffs on the country's trade. While exports increased to the Middle East and the U.S., the overall growth was lower than anticipated. The data comes as Japan is engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S., with President Trump indicating "big progress" in the talks. Analysts suggest that Japan is no longer the export powerhouse it once was, facing increasing competition from China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California is the first U.S. state to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging the president's authority to impose sweeping tariffs. Governor Gavin Newsom argues that the tariffs, enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, require Congressional approval. The lawsuit contends that the tariffs have inflated costs and caused billions of dollars in damage to California's economy, which is the largest among the states and a major exporter of goods. The state is asking the court to immediately block the tariffs.</p>

            <p>The White House is leveraging the tragic story of a mother whose daughter was murdered to promote its policy of mass deportations. Patty Morin, whose daughter Rachel was brutally raped and murdered, shared her story at a White House press briefing. The Trump administration is framing deportations as necessary to protect American lives, even in cases like Kimar Albrega Garcia, whose deportation was an acknowledged error. Critics argue that this tactic disregards the context of individual cases and due process.</p>
