          <p>England's head coach, Steve Borthwick, has expressed high praise for Leicester Tigers back-row player Emeka Ilione, who has been included in a national training camp. Borthwick highlighted Ilione's versatility, power, and his clean yet competitive technique at the breakdown as significant strengths. This focus on Ilione comes as Tom Willis becomes ineligible for England selection following his announced move to a French club. Borthwick emphasized his strategy of investing training and match time into players who will be available for the next World Cup, signaling a clear direction for the team's future composition.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced it will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, a move intended to allow officers to concentrate on criminal matters. This policy change was revealed as the Met dropped its investigation into "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence through social media posts. The force stated the new policy will reduce ambiguity and prevent officers from being drawn into policing "toxic culture war debates." Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not meet the legal threshold for a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites and online services globally, including Disney+, Reddit, and several banking apps. The issue originated from DNS problems within its US-East-1 region in Virginia, affecting over 70 of AWS's own services and impacting critical internal tools at Amazon's warehouses. Although AWS reported that the primary issue was mitigated within hours, some users continued to experience problems. The event highlights the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers, where a single technical fault can have cascading global effects.</p>

          <p>Millions of people participated in the nationwide 'No Kings' demonstrations, protesting the Trump administration's policies in what became largely peaceful and even cheerful events. Despite predictions of violence from some Republican leaders, who labeled the gatherings "Hate America" rallies, there were virtually no arrests or violent incidents reported in major cities like New York and San Francisco. The protests featured a diverse coalition of participants and a wide array of creative, often humorous, signs and costumes mocking the administration. The article suggests this movement may signify a new political posture, uniting a broad spectrum of Americans through shared opposition to the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to fast-track the delivery of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the AUKUS security pact, aimed at countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. President Trump confirmed the accelerated timeline during a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, stating the process is moving "very, very quickly." Under the agreement, the U.S. will sell up to five Virginia-class submarines to Australia, with the first delivery now expected sooner than the original 2032 target. Despite expediting the deal, Trump also expressed confidence that his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping would prevent conflict.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibit in Los Angeles, titled "Monuments," is displaying 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, transforming symbols of a painful past into contemporary art. The collection includes a melted-down bronze monument of General Robert E. Lee and a graffitied equestrian statue of Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The exhibition aims to confront the narrative of the 'Lost Cause' and the lionization of figures who fought to preserve slavery. This artistic repurposing comes at a time of national debate, with President Trump ordering the reinstallation of such monuments, highlighting the conflicting interpretations of American history and its symbols.</p>

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the agency responsible for safeguarding the U.S. nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees due to the ongoing government shutdown. This marks the first time the NNSA has had to furlough workers since its inception in 2000, leaving fewer than 400 employees on duty. While officials assure that the nuclear stockpile will remain secure, the furloughs are expected to hinder efforts to modernize aging weapons systems. The shutdown, now in its 20th day, stems from a budget impasse between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare funding.</p>

          <p>Dropping out of a debt settlement program before completion can lead to severe financial repercussions, often leaving individuals in a worse position than when they started. Unsettled debts remain fully owed, and accumulating interest and fees can significantly inflate the original balances. While funds deposited into a settlement account are typically returned, they may be reduced by the company's service fees. Furthermore, the individual's credit score, already impacted by the process, will not recover and may worsen as creditors resume collection activities, potentially including lawsuits.

This is the same statute under which Hunter Biden was convicted.

These findings are considered groundbreaking by some U.S. researchers, as large-scale clinical trials on cannabis are difficult to conduct in the United States due to its federal classification as a Schedule 1 drug.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: How a DNS Error at a Single AWS Data Center Disrupted the Internet</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent widespread internet outage was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error at a single, massive Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center in North Virginia. DNS acts as the internet's address book, and when it failed, it could no longer direct user traffic to the correct websites and apps, even though those services were still online. This common but disruptive technical issue highlights the risk of the internet's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud service providers like AWS, which supports roughly a third of all web traffic. The incident demonstrates how a localized failure can have a global cascading effect.</p>

          <p>The mass shooting in Leland, Mississippi, on October 10 has claimed another life, bringing the total number of fatalities to seven. Ebanee Williams, 25, succumbed to her injuries a week after the incident, which saw sixteen people shot in the town's downtown area. The event occurred just hours after a high school homecoming football game, and authorities believe it may have stemmed from a personal dispute. Nine individuals have been arrested in connection with the shooting, with several facing capital murder charges as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent drop in homicides, Chicago continues to grapple with a high rate of violent crime compared to other major U.S. cities, a reality often minimized or politicized by officials. The killing of off-duty police officer Aréanah Preston in May 2023 symbolizes the city's ongoing struggle. While politicians debate statistics, residents in many South and West Side neighborhoods face pervasive violence fueled by decades of disinvestment, gang fragmentation, and a police department slow to modernize. The article argues that acknowledging the severity of the problem, rather than deflecting with political talking points, is crucial for finding meaningful solutions.</p>

          <p>A peace deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the Trump administration, was severely tested over the weekend by renewed violence but appeared to be holding as of Monday. Israeli forces conducted strikes in Gaza, reportedly killing 45 people, after an attack left two of its soldiers dead. Senior U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner returned to Israel to help ensure the ceasefire does not collapse. Both sides accused each other of violations but have since recommitted to the process, which includes a hostage release agreement and the transit of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

He suggested that moderate Democrats may soon break the impasse, allowing for a funding resolution to pass. However, Hassett also warned that if a deal is not reached, the Trump administration might consider imposing "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown continues due to a dispute over federal funding priorities, with Democrats demanding that any new budget bill include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose their value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. This rapid depreciation is attributed to several factors, including historically higher government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline value for the used market. Additionally, the fast pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, can make older EV models seem obsolete more quickly. As more affordable, mainstream EVs enter the market, this trend could begin to shift, but for now, it remains a key consideration for potential buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Securing approval for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out most unsecured debts, is not guaranteed and hinges on a complex qualification process. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those earning below the median typically qualify easily, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. Courts also scrutinize filings for signs of abuse, such as luxury spending just before filing, and require completion of credit counseling. If denied, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement remain viable options.</p>

Erhurman's win is seen as a message from the Turkish Cypriot community in favor of preserving its secular identity and redefining its relationship with Turkey.

          <p>President Donald Trump's renewed threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S. could severely impact the global film industry, with Britain's sector being particularly vulnerable. The UK film and TV industry, which contributes significantly to the economy, is heavily dependent on U.S. partnerships, with American studios accounting for 65% of production spending last year. While some industry leaders question the practicality of such a tariff due to the collaborative nature of modern filmmaking, others worry it could stifle UK productions. The proposal adds another layer of uncertainty to an industry already facing challenges from strikes and post-pandemic recovery.</p>

Subsequently, Trump publicly stated that both sides should "stop right now at the battle lines" and claim victory, a proposal that effectively carves up Ukraine. Zelenskyy left the meeting without securing the long-range Tomahawk missiles he sought, highlighting a growing rift between the two leaders.</p>
