          <p>Following meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, former President Trump announced he has started organizing a trilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The meeting aims to advance peace negotiations for the nearly four-year-long war in Ukraine. European leaders, including those from Italy, France, and the UK, emphasized the need for strong security guarantees for Ukraine, a point Trump acknowledged and said would be a key part of discussions. Several leaders expressed optimism that recent diplomatic efforts have produced more progress than the preceding years of conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to sign an executive order aimed at banning mail-in ballots and certain voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, claiming they are corrupt. However, legal experts interviewed for this article assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to dictate how states conduct their elections. According to law professors, the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the executive branch, the power to regulate federal elections, and any such presidential order would likely face immediate and successful legal challenges. The experts also noted the significant logistical hurdles of implementing such a drastic change on a short timeline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that numerous women in Afghanistan are effectively trapped within the country's overwhelmed mental health system, often abandoned by their families with nowhere else to go. At a facility in Kabul, some women, including victims of domestic violence, have been confined for decades because strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions make it nearly impossible for them to live independently. Staff struggle to cope with overcrowding and a lack of resources, while the mental health crisis among Afghan women worsens due to the severe restrictions on their rights. The report highlights a system where women are left to live and die in confinement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump reiterated his plan to end mail-in voting through executive action, making unsubstantiated claims that the method is inherently corrupt and that the U.S. is the only country that uses it. This article fact-checks these assertions, noting that experts consider widespread voter fraud a myth and that over 30 other developed countries, including Canada and the UK, permit voting by mail. Election officials also emphasize that mail-in voting has been a secure and established practice in the U.S. since the Civil War. Implementing such a ban would be logistically unfeasible before the 2026 elections and would create chaos.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the escalating federal militarization of Washington, D.C., one week after President Trump initiated a takeover of the city's policing. With no clear mission or end-point defined for the deployment of National Guard troops, concerns are rising that the occupation could become permanent or serve as a model for similar actions in other Democrat-run cities. The author argues that the deployment is not effectively addressing crime and is instead intimidating residents, creating an atmosphere of unease. The piece frames the situation as an improvisational power grab that tests the limits of executive authority.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges related to the death of actor Matthew Perry, who died from a ketamine overdose in October 2023. Sangha is the last of five individuals charged in the case to enter a guilty plea, admitting to distributing the fatal dose of the drug. According to the Justice Department, she worked with others to supply the ketamine that was ultimately administered to Perry by his personal assistant. Her plea agreement also includes admissions related to another overdose death and running a drug-involved premises from her residence.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill requiring mortgage lenders to pay interest to homeowners on insurance payouts held in escrow after a natural disaster. Previously, lenders could deposit these funds, intended for rebuilding, into an account and keep the interest earned. The new legislation, which now heads to the governor's desk, guarantees homeowners at least 2% interest on these funds. The bill was prompted by the struggles of homeowners who lost their residences in recent wildfires and aims to close a loophole in existing state law, ensuring disaster victims receive all available financial support.</p>

Peiris emphasized that the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the massive destructive potential of such events on global health, economies, and social well-being.

The family's advocate claims the agents, who were masked, smashed the car's windows without clear cause, prompting the driver to flee.

          <p>Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan have returned to the state capital, declaring their weeks-long boycott a victory. By breaking the legislature's quorum, they successfully killed the special session and brought national attention to what they call a "racist map" designed to entrench Republican power. Although Governor Greg Abbott has already called another session where the map is expected to pass, Democrats say they have built the necessary legal record to challenge it in court. In response, several Democrat-led states are now considering their own mid-decade redistricting efforts.</p>

The summit, which included Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, was convened to address the path forward after Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department for imposing new immigration-related conditions on federal grants for crime victims. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally withholding over $1 billion in annual funding to compel states and localities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The states contend that this move is part of a broader effort to punish so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions. They argue that forcing victim-support programs to engage in immigration enforcement erodes trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, ultimately harming public safety.</p>

This move comes amid a series of dismissals of senior military officials by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth since he took office in January.

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about what they describe as the "most significant and disruptive" federal immigration raids in recent weeks. The warning follows several enforcement actions over the weekend, including one at a local car wash and another outside a Home Depot, which have heightened fear and uncertainty within the community. Anaheim, which has a large immigrant population, has joined a lawsuit challenging the federal government's enforcement tactics. Local leaders argue the raids destabilize the community and do not enhance public safety, instead creating fear even among U.S. citizens.</p>

          <h2>Hamas Reportedly Agrees to Latest Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Release Proposal</h2>

          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal would involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. This development comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces immense domestic pressure to secure a deal, with large protests demanding the return of all hostages. It is currently unclear how Israel will respond to the proposal, as it has previously insisted on the release of all hostages at once.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Debt Forgiveness Options for Buy Now, Pay Later Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:46:45 EDT</div>

          <p>This article examines whether debts from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay are eligible for debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, they can technically be included in debt settlement negotiations, similar to credit card debt. However, because BNPL is a newer form of financing, eligibility and the willingness of providers to negotiate can vary significantly. With defaults on these popular payment plans rising, the article suggests that consumers struggling with BNPL debt should also consider other strategies, such as direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling to regain financial control.</p>

          <h2>LGBTQ+ Literary Award Cancelled for the Year Amid Controversy Over Nominated Author</h2>

          <p>The organizers of the Polari Prize, a UK-based award for LGBTQ+ literature, have cancelled this year's event following a major controversy. The dispute arose after author John Boyne was longlisted for his novel, despite recently writing an article defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues. In protest of his nomination, more than 10 other longlisted authors withdrew from the prize, and over 800 publishing figures signed an open letter of criticism. After consultations, organizers decided to pause the prize for 2025 to review their governance and increase trans representation on their judging panels.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House demonstrated a significant shift in diplomatic strategy, marked by a collegial tone and formal attire, a contrast to a previous contentious meeting. This article highlights his "charm offensive" as a key takeaway, alongside President Trump's strongest indications yet of providing security guarantees for Ukraine, although specifics remain undefined. The prospect of a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Putin was also a central theme, with Trump framing it as a matter of "when, not if." The discussions underscored the complex dynamics at play in the ongoing peace efforts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:13:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin fell by over 1% to around $116,000 after reaching a new all-time high of nearly $125,000 last week. The broader cryptocurrency market also experienced a downturn, with over $500 million in long positions liquidated in 24 hours. The sell-off was reportedly triggered by macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data that has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Disappointment over the scope of a new U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve also contributed to the negative market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, suffered a brief but widespread network outage on Monday, its second service interruption in just two weeks. Thousands of users reported issues on the tech-logging site Downdetector. The previous outage on July 24 was attributed by the company to a failure of key internal software services. The service disruption occurred on the same day that SpaceX successfully launched another batch of satellites to expand its constellation, which currently provides internet to over six million users across 140 countries.</p>

          <p>Iran is on the brink of a severe water crisis, with officials warning that millions of residents could face shortages within weeks. The impending crisis is the result of a prolonged drought and extreme summer heat, which have been severely exacerbated by government mismanagement of the nation's dams and water resources. This combination of environmental and administrative failures has left water levels dangerously low across the country. The situation poses a significant threat to the daily lives of Iranians and the country's stability, highlighting the critical consequences of climate change and poor governance.</p>
