          <p>President Trump announced a halt to all trade negotiations with Canada, reacting to an advertising campaign from the province of Ontario. The ad used audio from former President Ronald Reagan's 1987 radio address cautioning against the negative impacts of tariffs. The Ronald Reagan Foundation criticized the ad for using "selective audio" and misrepresenting the speech, a point Trump echoed in his announcement. This move further strains relations between the two major trading partners, which have been tense amid ongoing tariff disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of fossils in New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations were diverse and thriving in North America just before the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. Researchers accurately dated fossils of species like Tyrannosaurus rex and the massive Alamosaurus to within 400,000 years of the asteroid strike. This finding challenges the long-held theory that dinosaurs were already in decline. However, some independent experts caution that evidence from a single location may not represent a complete global picture of dinosaur populations at the time.</p>

          <p>TikTok influencer Harrison Sullivan, known as HSTikkyTokky, has pleaded guilty to charges of dangerous driving and driving without insurance. The charges stem from a car crash in Surrey that occurred in March of the previous year. After failing to appear in court and posting videos from Qatar, Sullivan was arrested in October. He has been remanded in custody and is scheduled to be sentenced in November, bringing a nearly year-long police search to a close.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane over the weekend, posing a significant threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center has warned of potentially "catastrophic" and "life-threatening" flash flooding and landslides across the region. A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti and Jamaica, with the storm expected to bring up to 14 inches of rain. While the storm is not predicted to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland, its slow movement could lead to prolonged downpours in the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>England's starting goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, will miss the upcoming friendly match against Brazil due to an elbow injury. Her absence guarantees a debut for one of the backup goalkeepers, either Khiara Keating or Anna Moorhouse. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that while the injury is not major, it presents an opportunity to test other players in the squad. The match is part of a homecoming series for the Lionesses to celebrate their recent Euro 2025 victory and begin preparations for the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

          <p>A senior UK national security official has clarified that the term "enemy" was removed from a witness statement regarding a China spying case while the Conservative party was still in power. Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins stated in a letter to MPs that he amended a draft statement because calling China an "enemy" did not align with official government policy at the time. This revelation comes amid accusations that the current Labour government, led by Sir Keir Starmer, was responsible for the collapse of the case by not classifying China as a national security threat.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has announced a long-term strategy that will see the number of professional men's rugby teams in Wales reduced from four to three by the 2028 season.

The governing body has not yet determined how the reduction will be implemented but hopes for a collaborative process.

          <p>This article explores how the concept of "aliens" has evolved in popular culture, from the little green men of the 1950s to modern interpretations in film and technology. Social scientist Christian Peters explains how these depictions often reflect prevailing societal anxieties, such as Cold War paranoia, corporate greed, and fears of the unknown. The term "alien" itself has historical roots in describing foreigners, and its use in immigration debates highlights themes of otherness and exclusion. The discussion extends to artificial intelligence, which some experts describe as a form of "alien intelligence" that is reshaping human existence.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration has systematically reshaped the Department of Justice and the FBI into political instruments for retribution and reward. The author contends that a pattern has emerged where political opponents face investigation while allies receive leniency, pardons, or have cases dropped. Citing the firings of officials deemed disloyal and the installation of loyalists, the piece suggests that the rule of law is being subverted in favor of personal allegiance to the president.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the United Kingdom for a meeting with key European allies to discuss further military aid, particularly the provision of more long-range missiles. The summit, hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, aims to strengthen Ukraine's defensive capabilities ahead of the winter as Russia's invasion continues. This diplomatic effort follows recent announcements of new sanctions on Russia's energy sector by the EU and the US. The meeting underscores the ongoing international pressure on Moscow and the commitment of Western nations to support Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece frames the recent jewel theft at the Louvre Museum in Paris as a surprisingly lighthearted and captivating crime. The author argues that the non-violent heist, carried out by seemingly amateur burglars who escaped on mopeds, is a welcome distraction from more grim news cycles. The article suggests that such thefts often increase the fame and public interest in the stolen items, making art and history more accessible, albeit unconventionally. In a world of serious threats, the author finds a certain charm and democratic appeal in a well-executed, harmless caper.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion. This growth was driven by the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital in 18 years, with investors allocating $33.7 billion in the third quarter. Strong investment returns, particularly from successful bets on technology, artificial intelligence, and rising M&A activity, also contributed significantly to the asset swell. According to Hedge Fund Research, this historic growth indicates strong investor confidence in the sector's ability to navigate market trends and geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Savers can lock in these high rates for the duration of the CD term, which provides stability and protection against future rate drops.

Officials warn that illicit labs are producing these substances on an industrial scale, and smugglers are constantly adapting their routes and methods.

          <p>The new Bruce Springsteen biopic, "Deliver Me From Nowhere," focuses on the creation of his seminal 1982 album, "Nebraska," framing it almost entirely as a product of the musician's troubled relationship with his father. This review argues that while the film captures the personal turmoil, it oversimplifies Springsteen's creative process by neglecting his deep engagement with American musical traditions and iconography. By reducing the album's complex themes to a singular autobiographical source, the movie misses the broader cultural and artistic currents that have always informed Springsteen's work, ultimately presenting a limited view of his genius.</p>

The rapid and largely unannounced demolition has raised legal and ethical questions, particularly as it occurred during a government shutdown when oversight commissions are closed. Critics point to the unusual nature of such a drastic architectural change to the historic residence and the potential influence of private donors funding the project.
