          <p>The White House has initiated a review of eight Smithsonian museums to ensure their exhibitions align with President Trump's directive to celebrate "American exceptionalism." According to a letter sent to the institution, the review aims to remove divisive narratives and restore confidence ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. The process will examine public-facing content, the curatorial process, and the use of collections. In response, the Smithsonian reaffirmed its commitment to scholarly excellence and the factual presentation of history.</p>

          <p>Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to primarily discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The location holds historical significance as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The summit follows several unsuccessful rounds of peace talks and comes after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend the meeting, which Trump has described as a preliminary "feel-out meeting."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, a bipartisan measure that mandates more comprehensive background checks for police officer candidates. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 killing of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous law enforcement jobs. The new law requires agencies to review all prior employment records before making a job offer. The goal is to prevent officers with serious disciplinary issues from being hired.</p>

          <p>A Union Pacific train with approximately 35 cars derailed over a bridge in Palo Pinto County, Texas, prompting a significant emergency response. Officials confirmed that many of the derailed cars were carrying hazardous materials, but reported that none were actively leaking. While no injuries were reported, the incident was treated as a HazMat situation and caused a grass fire that crews worked to contain. The cause of the derailment is currently under investigation by Union Pacific.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell over 9% in extended trading, even after the company reported second-quarter revenue and future guidance that exceeded analyst expectations. The company's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, but it also recorded a net loss of $290.5 million, partly due to significant stock-based compensation costs. Despite strong demand for its services, the market reacted negatively to the widening losses and growing debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the legal framework behind President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington D.C. and his temporary takeover of the city's police force. Under the Home Rule Act, the president can assume control in an emergency, and as commander-in-chief of the D.C. Guard, can deploy them under federal authority. While these troops are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, officials state their current mission is focused on supporting law enforcement rather than direct arrests.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times review praises the Echo Theater Company's production of "Berta, Berta," a play about the intense reunion of two lovers in 1923 Mississippi. The critic reflects on the experience of attending a "Black Out" performance, an event designated for a Black audience to experience the work in community. This environment, the reviewer notes, heightened the play's historical resonance and created a powerful, living bond between the performance and the audience, revealing a deeper realism within the folktale-like drama.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have unsealed criminal charges against notorious Haitian gang leader Jimmy "Barbecue" Cherizier. The indictment alleges that Cherizier and a U.S. citizen conspired to solicit funds from the Haitian diaspora in the U.S. to purchase firearms for his gang alliance, which controls large parts of Port-au-Prince. This legal action targets the financial networks supporting the gang violence that has plunged Haiti into a deep security and humanitarian crisis.

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures surpassing 33.4C (92F) in several locations. This period of intense heat coincides with what experts are calling "nationally significant" water shortfalls due to prolonged dry weather. Amber heat health alerts are in effect for much of the country, and the conditions are causing disruptions to rail services and increasing the risk of wildfires. Millions of people are now living under hosepipe bans to conserve water.</p>
