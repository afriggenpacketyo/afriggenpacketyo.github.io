          <p>ABC News decided not to renew Terry Moran's contract after a social media post where he referred to President Trump and Stephen Miller as "world-class" haters, which the network deemed a violation of its objectivity policies. Moran, who had been with ABC News for 28 years, was suspended before the final decision. The network emphasized its commitment to fair and trusted journalism. This action comes after ABC settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump over comments made by George Stephanopoulos regarding a sexual assault case involving E. Jean Carroll. The settlement involved a $15 million payment earmarked for Trump's presidential library. The article reflects the increasing scrutiny and sensitivity surrounding political commentary by journalists. </p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second consecutive night of significant unrest with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks directed at police, who responded with water cannons and riot dogs. The violence followed a peaceful protest earlier in the day related to an alleged sexual assault. A member of the Northern Ireland Assembly reported that a family with young children had to barricade themselves in their attic during the attacks. Jim Allister, a North Antrim MP, faced criticism for comments that linked the violence to tensions arising from a high concentration of migrants in the area, while other politicians condemned the violence as racist.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has instructed U.S. embassies to proceed with terminating all remaining U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) staffers overseas, with the State Department assuming control of USAID's foreign assistance programs by Monday. This directive comes despite a federal judge's temporary block on President Trump's executive order for mass firings across federal agencies. The Trump administration claims the plan was already in motion before the order, thus not violating the injunction. This action is portrayed as the final step in dismantling USAID, including the dismissal of over 10,000 staffers and contractors, initiated by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). </p>

          <p>US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine skeptic, has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip), which provides official government recommendations on immunizations. Kennedy cited conflicts of interest within the committee as undermining public trust in vaccinations. Critics have described the move as norm-breaking and expressed concerns that Kennedy may appoint vaccine-skeptics to the board, potentially impacting vaccine recommendations and insurance coverage. The article illustrates the ongoing debate surrounding vaccine safety and policy. </p>
