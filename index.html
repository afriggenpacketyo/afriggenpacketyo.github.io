          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf ahead of his trip to the Middle East in the coming days. Iran's foreign minister slammed the reported change, writing that, "politically motivated attempts to alter the historically established name of the Persian Gulf are indicative of hostile intent toward Iran and its people, and are firmly condemned." Arab nations have pushed for a change to the geographic name of the body of water off the southern coast of Iran, while Iran has maintained its historic ties to the gulf under the Persian Empire.

The European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said that the EU continues to prepare for any scenario should current trade talks fail, though negotiations remain the priority. The EU has paused its initial set of retaliatory measures targeting around 21 billion euros worth of U.S. goods, pending the outcome of discussions with Washington.
