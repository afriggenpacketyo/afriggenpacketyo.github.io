          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially become Thailand's new prime minister following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The conservative politician's ascent marks a significant shift, ousting the influential Shinawatra dynasty that has long dominated Thai politics. Anutin secured the position with support from the main opposition, the People's Party, on the condition that he dissolves parliament and calls for new elections within four months. Known for championing the country's cannabis decriminalization, the 58-year-old former health minister has pledged to work with honesty for the nation's benefit.</p>

          <p>Russia has unleashed its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, launching over 800 drones, decoys, and missiles across the country. The attack resulted in at least two fatalities, including a one-year-old child, and injured fifteen others. For the first time, a key government building in Kyiv, which houses the Cabinet of Ministers, sustained significant damage to its roof and upper floors. Ukrainian officials, including Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, condemned the targeting of civilian and government infrastructure, calling for stronger international sanctions against Russia's oil and gas sectors in response.</p>

          <p>Two years after a devastating Achilles injury just four plays into his New York Jets career, quarterback Aaron Rodgers is set to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers against his former team. The highly anticipated 2023 season for the Jets ended in despair after Rodgers' injury, and the team has since undergone a major overhaul with a new coach and quarterback. Now 41, Rodgers' return to MetLife Stadium is framed by a narrative of closure and new beginnings, as both he and new Jets quarterback Justin Fields, formerly of the Steelers, face their old teams in the season opener.</p>

          <p>The US Open has evolved from a traditional tennis tournament into a major cultural event, increasingly resembling a festival like Coachella with its focus on consumption, celebrity appearances, and social media presence. The event now features high-priced novelty cocktails with their own merchandise lines, courtside reality dating shows, and a meticulously managed celebrity guest list designed to maximize online engagement. This transformation highlights a shift in modern sports, where the spectacle surrounding the event, driven by influencers and brand partnerships, becomes as significant as the athletic competition itself, creating a new festival-like economy.</p>

          <p>London is bracing for significant travel disruption as London Underground staff, represented by the RMT union, have begun a five-day strike. The industrial action, which is the first to affect the entire network since March 2023, centers on disputes over pay and fatigue management, with the union demanding a 32-hour work week. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay raise but deems the reduced work week unaffordable. Commuters can expect little to no service on the Tube from Monday to Thursday, with other transport services like the Elizabeth line and buses anticipated to be much busier.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected animal rights extremist accused of two bombings in California in 2003, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being a fugitive for 21 years. Once the first American-born citizen on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list with a $250,000 bounty, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in Wales. Former FBI agents involved in the original case recall a high-speed chase that ended with his disappearance and the discovery of a suspected bomb-making lab in his abandoned car. The hearing will determine if he is sent back to the U.S. to stand trial.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are on edge due to significant volatility in European bond markets, particularly concerning French government bonds. Political instability in France, where opposition parties threaten to vote against the government, raises the possibility of a snap election and has rattled investor confidence. This week, all eyes will be on the European Central Bank (ECB), which is expected to hold interest rates steady at 2% during its upcoming meeting. ECB President Christine Lagarde is anticipated to face questions about the French situation but is likely to maintain a cautious and non-committal stance on future policy.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is advancing its military capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost, long-range attack drones, aiming to create an affordable alternative to traditional cruise missiles. The development, in collaboration with U.S. firm Kratos, is based on the MQM-178 target drone system and is progressing rapidly. Unidentified sources within Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) claim the new suicide drones, designated Chien Feng IV, have a range of at least 1,000km. This would enable them to strike major cities deep within mainland China, including Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the United Kingdom are set for a celestial treat as a total lunar eclipse will turn the full moon a deep red color, an event commonly known as a 'Blood Moon'. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. The reddish hue is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, a process called Rayleigh scattering. While the full eclipse lasts for over an hour, visibility in the UK will be limited to the period after moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest view.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from the U.S. and China has developed a novel method to launch small robots using the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they create a powerful force capable of launching millimeter-scale objects up to five feet into the air. This technique offers a new, efficient launching mechanism that could have applications in robotics and micro-propulsion systems.</p>
