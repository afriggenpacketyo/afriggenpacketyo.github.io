        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for identifying and processing transgender service members for separation, following Defense Department directives. These guidelines instruct personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth, rather than their preferred pronouns, which contradicts transgender social norms. The criteria for identifying transgender soldiers include past requests for grooming standard exemptions or social media activity expressing a gender identity different from their assigned sex at birth. Critics argue that these policies are worse than the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, overtly targeting and hunting down transgender service members and represent a departure from the values of humility and selflessness expected of military members. The separation code may complicate security clearance maintenance for transgender veterans.</p>

          <p>Strategy's bitcoin treasury strategy is inspiring other companies to adopt similar approaches, including meme stock companies and media firms. Trump Media announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, and GameStop revealed a $500 million allocation. Michael Saylor, Strategy Chairman, believes this marks a global shift in corporate finance, with interest exploding in Hong Kong, Korea, Abu Dhabi, the Middle East, and the U.K. The Biden administration has often treated corporate bitcoin adoption as a regulatory red flag, but under President Donald Trump, the tone has changed with the establishment of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reassured allies in the Indo-Pacific that the U.S. will support them against China's increasing military and economic pressure. He insisted that these allies must also contribute more to their own defense, urging them to increase defense spending to levels similar to the 5% of their gross domestic product that European nations are now pressed to contribute. Hegseth accused China of actively training to invade Taiwan, which China has a stated goal of ensuring its military is capable of taking by force if necessary by 2027. He also cautioned Indo-Pacific countries that economic dependence on China could deepen their malign influence and complicate U.S. defense decisions.</p>

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center performed a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on a patient's spine through her eye. Karla Flores, who was initially diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, had a second chordoma discovered on her spinal cord during an MRI. The team developed a unique surgical plan, called the "third nostril" approach, to access the tumor through the side of Flores' eye. The procedure took about 20 hours and involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone, but the chordoma was successfully removed and Flores has no evidence of cancer nearly a year after completing treatment.</p>

To prevent war, the US wants "a strong shield of deterrence" forged with allies, and promised the US would "continue to wrap our arms around our friends and find new ways to work together".

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Mission: Impossible franchise has evolved from stand-alone stories with distinct authorial styles to a more interconnected cinematic universe. The earlier films, directed by Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird, prioritized individual creative strengths over consistent lore. The recent films, including Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning, emphasize continuity and overarching plans, which streamlines the earlier stories but overlooks their appeal. This shift reflects a broader trend in big-budget filmmaking, where studios prioritize cinematic universes and connecting disparate story threads.</p>

          <p>A monument to Joseph Stalin has been replicated and reinstalled in a Moscow metro station, stirring controversy. The original statue, depicting Stalin with admiring children and workers, was removed in the 1960s during the de-Stalinization period. While President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged the tragic period of Stalinist purges, an estimated 105 statues honoring the dictator have been erected since he came to power. The restored monument does not include several features of the original, making it more of an ideological gesture than a genuine attempt to restore the historical architectural appearance.</p>

This comes after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on social media late on Wednesday that the US would “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students, particularly “those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields”. The scope of the visa crackdown remains unclear, with Rubio’s department refusing to specify the criteria for visa revocation or clarify what constitutes “critical fields” and how ties to China’s ruling party would be defined.</p>

The Weather Service spokesperson said that the agency “has updated the service level standards for its weather service forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources” and “continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions”.</p>
