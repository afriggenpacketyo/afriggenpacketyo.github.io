        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is reintroducing a more rigorous civics test for citizenship applicants, a policy from the first Trump administration that the Biden administration had rescinded. The new test will require applicants to study from a pool of 128 questions and correctly answer 12 out of 20, an increase from the previous 100-question pool where 6 out of 10 correct answers were needed. This change is part of a broader effort by the current administration to tighten legal immigration processes, which also includes expanded background checks. Proponents argue it ensures new citizens embrace American values, while critics contend it creates unnecessary barriers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a contentious Senate hearing, Senator Rand Paul confronted former CDC Director Susan Monarez and Senator Bernie Sanders regarding the scientific basis for certain vaccine recommendations for infants. Paul questioned the necessity of the COVID-19 and Hepatitis B vaccines for newborns, arguing there is no clear benefit that outweighs potential risks for this age group. Monarez, who claims she was ousted for refusing to fire staff behind the recommendations, did not directly answer Paul's questions about the medical proof. The exchange highlighted the deep political and scientific divisions over the CDC's guidance on childhood immunizations and federal vaccine policy.</p>

          <p>The European Union is pursuing a new strategic agenda with India, aiming to strengthen trade and defense cooperation to draw New Delhi away from Russia's sphere of influence. This approach contrasts with the US, which has imposed tariffs on India for purchasing Russian fuel. The EU's strategy emphasizes India's role as a reliable partner, a counterweight to China, and a key player in diversifying global supply chains. The partnership also focuses on defense industrial cooperation, as India, the world's largest arms importer, seeks to modernize its military and reduce its dependency on Russian weaponry.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to a potential safety hazard. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), trim pieces on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is in motion. These detached parts could create a road hazard for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash. The issue is reportedly related to a vehicle assembly problem rather than a defective part, and dealers will inspect and replace the trim for free. No accidents or injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have arrived in the United Kingdom for a second state visit, hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. The three-day visit includes a formal welcome with a carriage procession, a royal salute, and a state banquet. On Thursday, the president is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers to discuss a potential UK-US trade deal.

          <p>The accuracy of official U.S. economic statistics is being questioned as government data-gathering methods face growing challenges. Response rates for critical surveys that inform metrics like employment and household income have plummeted, potentially skewing results and providing a less reliable picture of the economy. This issue was highlighted by a recent large downward revision of job growth numbers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The article argues that the government's reliance on underfunded, survey-based methods is outdated and fails to incorporate more dynamic, real-time data from private sources, creating significant information lags for policymakers and businesses.</p>

According to the article, several factors could contribute to this continued rise, including anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which can make gold a more attractive investment. Additionally, rising inflation and general market uncertainty are driving investors toward safe-haven assets like gold, further boosting its value.

Analysts predict an inflation adjustment of around 2.7%, which would raise the income thresholds for each tax bracket, preventing "bracket creep" where cost-of-living pay increases push workers into higher tax rates. This annual change, along with adjustments to the standard deduction, ensures that tax policies keep pace with inflation. The adjustments for 2026 will also incorporate changes from recent tax legislation, including a more generous inflation bump for the bottom two tax brackets.</p>

          <p>Authorities have released new details about the investigation into the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, revealing how the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was identified. Charging documents show Robinson's own parents recognized him from security footage and confronted him, after which he allegedly admitted to the shooting, stating Kirk "spreads too much hate." The documents also detail text messages between Robinson and his roommate in which he confessed to the act and discussed his motivations. Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, with prosecutors noting he had planned the attack for about a week.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Interest Rates Decline to a Three-Year Low Ahead of Expected Fed Action</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average interest rates for 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen to 6.13%, their lowest level in three years, sparking a surge in both new loan and refinancing applications. This sharp decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an impending interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which has caused yields on 10-year Treasury notes to drop. For potential homebuyers and existing homeowners with higher-rate loans, this creates a significant opportunity to secure more affordable financing. The article advises borrowers to act promptly by comparing lenders, checking their credit, and getting preapproved to capitalize on the favorable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle has publicly pushed back against United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who recently declared that the ultra-low-cost airline model is dead. Kirby had predicted that Spirit Airlines would go out of business, but Biffle retorted that the issue is an oversupply of flights in the U.S., not a flawed business model. He emphasized Frontier's lower operating costs and its role in serving price-sensitive customers who might otherwise not fly. The exchange highlights the intense competition and strategic disagreements within the U.S. airline industry as budget carriers struggle with rising costs and pressure from larger rivals.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers are questioning whether David Sacks, President Trump's advisor on AI and cryptocurrency, has violated the 130-day work limit for his role as a Special Government Employee (SGE). In a formal letter, they pressed Sacks to account for his workdays, citing concerns that overstaying the limit could raise ethical issues, especially as the administration develops new crypto regulations. The SGE designation allows private sector experts to serve temporarily in government with looser conflict-of-interest rules. A spokesperson for Sacks stated that he carefully manages his time to remain in compliance with the regulations.</p>

          <p>China's government has reportedly instructed its largest technology companies to halt purchases of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, an AI chip specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. This move is seen as the latest escalation in the ongoing tech rivalry between the U.S. and China and signals Beijing's growing confidence in its domestic chip manufacturing capabilities. House Speaker Mike Johnson called the action a strain on relations, while Nvidia's CEO expressed disappointment. The ban complicates the landscape for U.S. chipmakers, who rely on the Chinese market for billions in revenue, while China promotes domestic alternatives like Huawei's Ascend 910B chip.</p>

          <p>Scientific experts are raising alarms that the Trump administration is waging a broad "war on science," resulting in the firing of thousands of government scientists and deep cuts to vital research programs. The article details a pattern of actions across public health, climate science, and environmental protection where career specialists have been dismissed and scientific evidence has been disregarded in favor of political ideology. Critics warn this purge of expertise could take decades to reverse and is undermining the role of science in public policy. The Union of Concerned Scientists has documented over 400 instances it defines as "attacks on science" since Trump's second term began.</p>

          <p>A decade after selling the livestreaming app Periscope to Twitter, co-founder Kayvon Beykpour has launched a new startup called Macroscope, securing $40 million in venture funding. Unlike Periscope's consumer focus, Macroscope is a business-oriented tool designed to help software developers identify issues in their code and provide managers with greater transparency into engineering progress. The platform integrates with tools like GitHub and uses AI models from OpenAI and Google to analyze code and answer questions. Beykpour aims to solve the problem of opaqueness in the software development process, which he experienced firsthand as a product leader at Twitter.</p>

          <p>A major Israeli ground offensive in Gaza City has prompted thousands of Palestinian civilians to flee south as bombardment intensifies. Israel states its military operation aims to defeat Hamas fighters and free remaining hostages, but the action has drawn widespread condemnation from international aid agencies, who call the humanitarian situation unconscionable. A recent UN inquiry concluded Israel had committed genocide, a charge Israel denies. Reports from the city describe continuous shelling, with facilities like a children's hospital being hit, exacerbating the crisis for the remaining population.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified before a Senate committee that she was fired for resisting political pressure from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Monarez stated that she was dismissed after refusing Kennedy's demands to pre-approve the recommendations of a key vaccine advisory panel and to fire career scientists. She described a tense meeting where Kennedy informed her the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing and that she "needed to be on board." Her testimony paints a picture of an embattled public health agency facing intense ideological pressure that she claims prioritizes politics over evidence-based science.</p>
