        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and halting flights at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued only its second-ever dust storm warning for the Chicago area, surprising residents unaccustomed to such phenomena in an urban setting. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois. While skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, the event left a lasting impression on those who witnessed it, with one resident describing it as "something out of the history books."</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. He secured over $2 trillion in economic investments for the United States, including deals with Boeing and G.E. The New York Times article notes that Trump was treated to lavish welcoming ceremonies, Arabian horses, and glitzy chandeliers, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies. Gulf leaders praised Trump's shift towards peace and profit in the region, echoing his campaign slogans and expressing enthusiasm for his leadership. </p>

          <p>Ammunition manufacturers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear for their survival due to tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods exported to the United States. The New York Times article explains that the United States has long been a steady market for Gorazde's weapons factories, but the new tariffs have disrupted expansion plans and risk scaring off American customers. Ginex, a local company that makes ignition devices used in ammunition, has already postponed plans to increase its workforce. The mayor of Gorazde worries that the United States has abandoned its faith in free trade as a path to peace in the region.</p>

          <p>The case of a Wisconsin judge charged with helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities is similar to a case in Massachusetts involving Judge Shelley Joseph. Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape ICE. The NPR article discusses the rarity of such prosecutions and raises questions about federal overreach into state judicial proceedings. While some see these cases as obstruction of justice, others view them as examples of judges exercising discretion within their courtrooms and protecting individuals from intimidation.</p>

Emirati corporations are investing in ports, renewable energy projects, and critical mineral mines across Africa. This move is part of the Emirates' plan to diversify its economy and increase its influence over global supply chains, as the Trump administration reduces funding and dismantles U.S.A.I.D. programs in the region.</p>
