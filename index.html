          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store after a judge ruled that Apple cannot prohibit link-outs or commissions on them, a decision favoring Epic Games. Fortnite was removed from the App Store in 2020 when Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its website. Apple retains the option to reject the resubmission and is appealing the contempt ruling. This ruling has already impacted app development economics, with companies like Amazon and Spotify updating their apps to direct customers to their websites for payments.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly considered raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while simultaneously expressing political reservations about the move. Trump indicated a willingness to accept a small tax increase on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but he acknowledged the potential political backlash from Democrats. Trump's comments create further uncertainty for GOP leaders struggling to balance tax cuts with fiscal responsibility. He also referenced George H.W. Bush's broken promise not to raise taxes, suggesting Republicans should avoid a similar scenario, while still being open to the idea.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., sparking criticism regarding her qualifications and political affiliations. Pirro, a former New York prosecutor and judge, replaces Ed Martin, who was removed after losing Republican support in the Senate. Democrats have questioned Pirro's credentials for the role, while Republicans have praised her appointment. Martin will now serve as director of the "weaponization working group" within the Justice Department, investigating officials who investigated Trump.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has stated that air traffic control problems at Newark Liberty International Airport will not be fully resolved until the summer.

Recent disruptions were attributed to communication line failures and controller stress, necessitating new personnel training. Duffy emphasized the priority of safety, which may lead to delays or cancellations, and highlighted the need for significant funding from Congress to modernize the system.</p>
