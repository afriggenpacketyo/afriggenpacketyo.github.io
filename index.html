        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arianna Huffington is challenging the cultural belief that success requires constant overwork, labeling it a "collective delusion" that ignores serious health risks like burnout. Drawing from her personal experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, the Thrive Global CEO advocates for prioritizing well-being as a key component of professional effectiveness. She promotes the concept of "micro steps"—small, incremental changes in daily habits—to build a healthier and more sustainable path to achievement, arguing that recharging is not a luxury but a necessity for creativity, leadership, and resilience.</p>

          <p>In a speech to senior military leaders, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced a major policy shift to end what he termed "woke" culture within the armed forces. He introduced new directives to raise physical fitness requirements to a single "male level," toughen grooming standards, and remove racial quotas, asserting these changes are vital for maintaining a "warrior ethos." Hegseth justified the recent firing of top generals, stating a change in culture required new leadership, and was followed by President Trump who reinforced the administration's commitment to making the military stronger and more merit-based.</p>

          <p>A notable trend of spiritual revival is emerging in the U.S., particularly among young men in Generation Z, who are embracing Christianity and participating in baptisms in large numbers. Events like "Baptize America" are drawing thousands, reflecting new research that shows belief in Jesus is rising among young people after a post-pandemic low. Pastors and observers attribute this surge to a search for meaning after the isolation of the pandemic and a reaction to a life inundated with technology, with Gen Z men now more likely to attend church than their female counterparts for the first time in history.</p>

          <p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth detailed new policies aimed at restoring what he calls a "commonsense application of standards" in the military, focusing on combat readiness and discipline. A key change requires all combat personnel, regardless of gender, to meet the highest male physical standard, a move Hegseth stated is about capability, not preventing women from serving. The new rules also enforce stricter grooming standards, such as being clean-shaven, and eliminate diversity and inclusion initiatives, which the Secretary referred to as "toxic ideological garbage."</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is facing a potential shutdown as funding is set to expire at the end of Tuesday without a new spending bill. The impasse stems from a partisan divide, with Democrats leveraging their necessary votes in the Senate to demand the extension of healthcare tax credits and the reversal of cuts to Medicaid and health agencies. Republicans, who control Congress, have so far been unwilling to concede on these points, creating a high-stakes standoff that could halt many non-essential government services for the first time in nearly seven years.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the 33-year-old founder of the student financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for fraud. A jury found her guilty of deceiving JPMorgan Chase during its $175 million acquisition of her company by massively inflating the number of users Frank actually had. Javice provided the bank with falsified data showing over 4 million users when the real number was closer to 300,000. In addition to prison time, she was ordered to forfeit over $22 million and pay more than $287 million in restitution to JPMorgan.</p>

          <p>A second person, 32-year-old Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, has died from injuries sustained during a shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas. He was one of three detainees shot in what authorities have described as a targeted "sniper assault" by a gunman who was later found dead from a self-inflicted wound. The first victim was identified as 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of targeted violence, with investigators finding notes at the suspect's home outlining a plan to target the facility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that Pfizer has agreed to lower the cost of some of its prescription drugs for Medicaid, as part of a broader push for "most favored nation" pricing from pharmaceutical companies. This development comes as the White House prepares to launch a new direct-to-consumer website called "TrumpRX" for purchasing prescription medications. The move is framed by the administration as a significant step in reducing healthcare costs for Americans, occurring just as a political battle over healthcare subsidies intensifies amid the looming government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Canadian police have identified remains known as "The Woman in the Well" as Alice Spence, a woman born in 1881 who had been missing since approximately 1916. Her preserved remains were discovered in a barrel in an old well in Saskatoon in 2006. The century-old cold case was solved using investigative genetic genealogy, where scientists at a private lab built a DNA profile from the skeletal evidence to trace her living relatives. This marks the oldest case in Canada to be solved with this advanced forensic technique, bringing a name to a victim whose death was deemed suspicious over 100 years ago.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is undertaking a massive initiative to integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of its operations, with the goal of becoming a "fully AI-connected enterprise." The bank is using a proprietary platform called LLM Suite, which leverages models from OpenAI and Anthropic, to develop personalized AI assistants for every employee and automate complex processes. This strategic rewiring could fundamentally change how the bank operates, from creating investment banking presentations in seconds to providing AI-driven concierge services for clients, potentially boosting productivity and reshaping the future of corporate labor in finance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a critical analysis of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's address to the military's top commanders, arguing it resembled a political rally rather than a professional military briefing. The speech is characterized as self-indulgent and dangerous, highlighting Hegseth's attacks on "fat generals," diversity initiatives, and established rules of engagement, which some interpret as opening the door to war crimes. The author contends that by spending millions to gather global commanders for a partisan speech, Hegseth undermined military professionalism and advised those who disagreed with his agenda to resign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant scientific breakthrough, researchers at Oregon Health and Science University have created early-stage human embryos using DNA from skin cells. The novel technique involves transferring the nucleus from a skin cell into a donor egg that has had its own genetic material removed, then inducing the egg to halve its chromosomes before fertilization with sperm. While still in its early stages and requiring years of refinement, this technology could potentially overcome infertility for many, and even allow same-sex couples to have children genetically related to both partners, opening new frontiers in reproductive science.</p>

          <p>As a government shutdown looms, advocates and former National Park Service superintendents are urging the Trump administration to close the parks to the public if funding lapses. They fear a repeat of the 2018-2019 shutdown, when parks remained open without sufficient staff, leading to widespread vandalism, destruction of natural resources like Joshua trees, and overflowing trash. With parks already operating under significant budget cuts and reduced staffing, leaving them open and unmanaged during a busy autumn season could lead to irreversible damage and pose serious safety risks to visitors and wildlife.</p>
