          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade deal, averting the threat of higher tariffs. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a lower rate than the 30% previously proposed by President Trump. As part of the deal, the 27-member EU bloc has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in investments into the United States. The announcement was made following discussions between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While announcing a new trade agreement with the European Union, President Trump also addressed the humanitarian situation in Gaza. He deflected questions about Israel's role in allowing aid into the region by blaming Hamas for stealing food supplies and causing widespread hunger. Trump stated that the U.S. has provided significant aid but has not received proper recognition, suggesting other countries should increase their contributions. These comments were made in Scotland following negotiations with EU officials, adding a distinct geopolitical dimension to his trip.</p>

          <p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot described the situation in Gaza as "appalling" and on the brink of a "food catastrophe," calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered aid access. He explicitly urged the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which he stated has caused a "bloodbath" at distribution sites. Barrot also defended France's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the UN, framing it as a necessary step to restart a political process toward a two-state solution. This positions France in opposition to the current U.S. stance on the matter.</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" by CBS has ignited a debate about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While some view it as a one-off financial decision, others see it as a sign of a broader decline for the genre amid shifting viewer habits and the rise of streaming. The article notes the significant financial losses associated with producing these shows, as declining linear TV ad revenue fails to cover high production costs.

The piece contends that this new "Trump Doctrine" shields autocrats and kleptocrats from accountability, creating a global environment where even previously reform-minded leaders feel empowered to protect their allies from investigation.

          <p>Investors are preparing for a pivotal week packed with market-moving events, including a Federal Reserve policy meeting, key inflation data, and the July jobs report. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady, but its outlook on future cuts will be closely scrutinized. Additionally, major technology and consumer companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks are set to release their earnings reports. Ongoing trade negotiations, particularly between the U.S. and the European Union ahead of an August 1 deadline, will also be a primary focus for Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" has debuted at the top of the box office, earning an estimated $118 million in domestic ticket sales. The film, which introduces Marvel's First Family into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, also brought in $100 million internationally for a global opening of $218 million. This strong performance, alongside the recent success of DC's "Superman," suggests that audiences will still turn out for well-received superhero films. The movie's positive reception is a significant boost for Marvel, which has seen fluctuating box office returns and critical reviews for its post-'Endgame' releases.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would have "great pause" about any potential pardon or commutation for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. His comments came after a top Justice Department official met with Maxwell, fueling speculation. Johnson called her crimes "unforgivable" but deferred the ultimate decision to the president. The discussion highlights a split within the Republican party, as some, like Rep. Thomas Massie, have suggested her testimony could be compelled in exchange for leniency to uncover more information about Jeffrey Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>During a television interview, Senator Markwayne Mullin incorrectly claimed that Jeffrey Epstein's controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement was made under the Obama administration. CNN's Jake Tapper repeatedly corrected the senator, pointing out that the deal was negotiated in 2008 when George W. Bush was president and the U.S. Attorney involved was a Bush appointee. The plea deal allowed Epstein to serve just 13 months in a work-release program for state-level prostitution charges, avoiding a potential life sentence on federal charges. Mullin's factual error highlights the political complexities and misinformation surrounding the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party, if returned to power, would introduce legislation to ban all NHS doctors from striking. The proposal would place doctors under the same industrial action restrictions as police and military personnel by enforcing minimum service levels. The announcement comes as thousands of resident doctors are engaged in a five-day strike over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) called the proposal a "desperate intervention," arguing that the right to strike is a last resort and fundamental in a modern democracy.</p>

          <p>A major fire has broken out in the West Midlands, UK, involving four factory units and 20 tonnes of tyres.

The blaze has produced a large, thick plume of smoke visible for miles, prompting warnings for residents to keep doors and windows closed. Several nearby homes have been evacuated as a precaution due to the scale of the fire and concerns over a partial structural collapse in one of the buildings.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity experts are warning of a rise in "quishing" scams, where malicious QR codes are used to deceive people into visiting fraudulent websites or downloading malware. Attackers exploit the public's trust and the ubiquity of QR codes by placing fake stickers on things like parking meters or utility bills. These scams can lead to the theft of personal and financial information. The Federal Trade Commission has issued warnings about the practice, and security researchers are working on developing more secure QR code technology to combat the growing threat, which is seen as a low-effort, high-return tactic for criminals.</p>

          <p>Senior U.S. officials have reportedly seen schematics for refitting a Boeing 747-8 jet, donated by the Qatari royal family, for use as Air Force One. President Trump previously confirmed the donation, valued at $400 million, which he described as a "gift" that will go to his presidential library after his term. The arrangement has drawn scrutiny due to constitutional rules preventing a president from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. The plane will require extensive and costly renovations to meet security and operational standards before it can serve as the presidential aircraft.</p>
