          <p>Donald Trump claims that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to provide him with banking services, forcing him to use smaller institutions. These allegations have renewed a debate about whether large banks unfairly "de-bank" clients for political reasons. The Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to penalize banks for such actions, while banking industry groups attribute the issue to a complex regulatory framework. Both banks involved have responded, with JPMorgan denying political motives and Bank of America's CEO acknowledging the need to navigate complex regulations.</p>

The call comes as Trump has set an August 8 deadline for Russia to make peace or face harsher economic penalties, with Zelenskyy noting Moscow is feeling the pressure. The article also covers other war developments, including Russia's potential deployment of previously banned mid-range missiles and Ukraine's amnesty program for thousands of military deserters.

          <p>Senator Tom Cotton is calling for the IRS to strip the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) of its tax-exempt status, alleging ties to terrorist organizations. Cotton's letter cites CAIR's past listing as an unindicted co-conspirator in a major terrorism-financing case involving the Holy Land Foundation. CAIR has refuted these claims as "debunked conspiracy theories," asserting its role as a civil rights organization and condemning both the October 7th attacks and the subsequent conflict in Gaza. The controversy follows the Biden administration's previous condemnation of remarks made by CAIR's executive director.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is launching a pilot program that may require tourists and business travelers from certain countries to post bonds of up to $15,000. This measure targets countries with high rates of visa overstays and is part of a broader Trump administration effort to tighten immigration controls. Critics, including the Cato Institute, argue the policy will harm the U.S. tourism industry and create significant barriers for travelers. The program will initially apply to visitors from Malawi and Zambia, with the list of affected countries subject to change.</p>

This efficiency will not only improve the quality and personalization of advice but also democratize access for middle-income families by lowering costs.

          <p>Pakistani authorities arrested over 240 supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan during nationwide protests marking the second anniversary of his detention. The demonstrations, organized by his PTI party, called for his release and were met with a heavy police presence, including tear gas in Karachi. Khan, who was ousted in 2022, is serving multiple prison sentences on charges his supporters claim are politically motivated. Despite the crackdown, Khan urged his followers to continue peaceful protests for the restoration of democracy.</p>

Experts attribute this decline in public activity to several factors, including internal fractures within the groups and the fact that the administration's aggressive policies, particularly on immigration, align with their own goals. With agencies like ICE enacting forceful measures, there is less for these groups to rally around, leading them to remain more underground.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering a plan for the full military occupation of the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli media. He has discussed options with the army chief, though military leaders are said to be concerned about the high risks to both soldiers and the remaining hostages. The plan, which would require approval from the security cabinet, comes as the war approaches its 22nd month. Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert criticized the idea as "outrageous," warning it would lead to an endless war with many casualties.</p>

The statue has long been a point of controversy, and its removal was part of a nationwide reckoning with Confederate monuments following the murder of George Floyd.

          <p>The Florida Department of Health is warning of the dangers of consuming unpasteurized raw milk after an outbreak sickened 21 people, including six children. The illnesses, caused by E. coli and campylobacter bacteria, have been linked to a single farm and resulted in seven hospitalizations. While selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, a loophole that allows for its purchase. Health officials stress that pasteurization is the only way to kill harmful bacteria, while proponents of raw milk make unproven health claims.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible was "preventable." The report states that owner OceanGate used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory loopholes to avoid safety scrutiny for years. Key findings blame a flawed design, the use of a previously damaged hull, and a "toxic" safety culture where employee concerns were dismissed. The investigation largely faulted the late CEO Stockton Rush, stating his overconfidence and negligence directly contributed to the deaths of the five people aboard the vessel.</p>

This article analyzes why the seemingly simple pun has generated such a strong reaction, connecting it to Sweeney's embodiment of the "blonde bombshell" archetype. The author argues this classic Hollywood image carries a complex legacy tied to American ideas about white femininity, sexuality, and power. The controversy reveals the potent and often unsettling symbolism that the bombshell persona still holds in contemporary culture.</p>

          <p>With persistent economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and renewed inflation concerns, investors are increasingly looking to gold as a safe-haven asset. This article suggests that 1-ounce gold bars are a particularly smart option, citing their liquidity and versatility for individual investors. A recent price forecast from Citi raised the short-term target for gold to $3,500 per ounce, potentially offering significant appreciation for current buyers. The bars provide a tangible hedge against inflation and are easier to trade and store than larger formats. (not investment advice)</p>
