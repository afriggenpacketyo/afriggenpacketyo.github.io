          <p>U.S. Attorney Alina Habba dropped the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during an ICE facility visit in Newark. Habba cited moving forward as the reason for the dismissal. Simultaneously, Congresswoman LaMonica McIver faces charges for allegedly assaulting and impeding law enforcement during the same visit. Both Baraka and McIver have criticized the ICE facility, alleging dangerous conditions and permit violations, which the Department of Homeland Security denies. The U.S. Attorney has invited Mayor Baraka to tour Delaney Hall to see that the government has nothing to hide.</p>

          <p>A Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Seville flew for approximately 10 minutes without active pilot supervision after the co-pilot became incapacitated and the captain was locked out of the cockpit. The co-pilot's sudden incapacitation, later attributed to an undetected neurological condition, occurred while the captain was using the restroom. During the period of pilot absence, the autopilot system maintained the flight's trajectory, correcting minor deviations caused by the co-pilot's accidental contact with the controls. The captain eventually regained access to the cockpit, and the flight was safely diverted to Madrid where the co-pilot received medical attention.</p>

          <p>A divided appeals court ruled in favor of a Venezuelan man seeking to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a previous order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return, finding that his removal violated a class-action settlement. The man, identified as "Cristian," was deported under the Alien Enemies Act, which the court deemed a breach of the settlement agreement. The government argued that Cristian was an admitted gang member and had a felony drug conviction, but the court found the evidence presented was insufficient.</p>

          <p>Chinese exporters are offering U.S. businesses deals that circumvent tariffs by using "delivered-duty-paid" shipping and under-invoicing shipments. This involves understating the value of goods or mislabeling them on shipping documents and routing shipments through shell companies acting as importers of record. These shell companies often default on tariff payments, utilizing a minimum $50,000 customs bond before ceasing operations and setting up a new entity. This practice is reportedly becoming more prevalent as businesses seek to avoid tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>James Comey defended his controversial Instagram post featuring the numbers '8647' written in seashells, claiming it was an innocent discovery during a beach walk with his wife. Comey explained that he interpreted the numbers as slang for 'ditching' something, but Trump allies accused him of calling for violence against the president. The Secret Service investigated the post, which Comey eventually removed. He criticized the Trump administration for using power to target individuals and erode the rule of law.</p>

The Freedom Ranger Hatchery criticized the USPS for not expediting the packages once the error was recognized, impacting small family farms expecting the birds. The USPS stated it is investigating the incident and has established processes for the safe handling of live animal shipments.</p>
