          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded in what authorities describe as a deliberate ambush in Idaho. The incident occurred as they responded to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain, which investigators believe was set by the suspect to lure them to the location. Law enforcement later found the body of the suspected lone gunman near the scene, bringing a tense hours-long situation to a close. The motive for the attack remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), faces a critical court ruling that could nullify its recent party congress and delegitimize its new reform-minded leadership. The legal challenge was brought by the party's old guard, led by former chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu, following their defeat in a leadership election. Observers suggest the trial may be a strategic maneuver by President Erdogan to weaken and divide the increasingly popular opposition. A ruling against the current leadership could plunge the party into chaos and significantly hamper its ability to challenge the government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun debating a significant Republican-backed bill, with a final vote expected after an extended amendment process known as a "vote-a-rama." The proceedings have highlighted divisions within the Republican party, with Senator Thom Tillis vocally condemning the legislation for breaking promises related to Medicaid funding. Meanwhile, President Trump urged his party's senators on social media not to be overly aggressive with cost-cutting, reminding them of their need to be reelected.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary has revealed a stark, mainstreamed Islamophobia within American political discourse. The author contends that the attacks on Mamdani are not just about his religion but are a reaction against his progressive politics, particularly his views on economics and Israel. Mamdani's refusal to compromise his principles, despite the backlash, is seen as a threat to the political establishment. The piece concludes that the intense, prejudiced reaction inadvertently highlights the growing power of marginalized views that challenge the status quo.</p>

The expert, Elisa Morgera, argues that wealthy fossil fuel-producing nations are legally obligated under international human rights law to phase out oil, gas, and coal by 2030. The report details the severe and widespread human rights impacts of the entire fossil fuel lifecycle. It calls for a complete "defossilization" of economies to protect human rights and avert further planetary crises.</p>

The Japan Fair Trade Commission found that the company imposed excessive sales quotas on its dealers.

This pressure reportedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to meet the quotas, an anti-competitive practice the commission is now moving to halt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent market speculation has positioned British oil giant BP as a potential acquisition target, a significant shift for the century-old company. This vulnerability stems from a combination of factors, including the abrupt 2023 departure of CEO Bernard Looney, who had initiated a major strategic shift toward renewable energy. The company's subsequent strategic reset, which increased focus back on oil and gas, and a share price that has underperformed relative to rivals like Shell, have fueled the takeover rumors. While BP's new CEO has brushed off the concerns, the situation reflects investor uncertainty about the company's long-term direction.</p>

          <p>As England's women's football team prepares to defend its European title, manager Sarina Wiegman faces key questions regarding her starting lineup and the squad's experience. The team's final warm-up match, a dominant 7-0 victory over Jamaica, provided strong hints about her selections, with players like Jess Carter and Ella Toone making compelling cases for inclusion. Despite the recent retirement of key veterans and fitness concerns for others, the squad retains a strong core from its World Cup run. The main concern remains the lack of experience among the backup goalkeepers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for his recent comments about imposing new tariffs on Japanese automobiles. During a television interview, he appeared to forget the name of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, referring to him as "Mr. Japan" while outlining a hypothetical letter announcing a 25% tariff. Trump argued the move was necessary to address a trade imbalance, claiming Japan does not import enough American cars. Critics pointed out that the majority of Japanese cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured domestically, making the tariff threat less impactful than suggested.</p>

While sub-indexes for production and new orders showed slight improvement, factory employment and inventory levels continued to decline.

The new measure allows for the import of aquatic products from most of Japan but maintains the ban on those originating from ten prefectures, including Fukushima.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency deceleration caused by regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. Regenerative braking captures kinetic energy to recharge the battery when the vehicle slows down. Researchers are investigating this link to improve passenger comfort and address a potential barrier to the broader adoption of EV technology.</p>
