          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group announced its departure from Mali after over three years of combating Islamic extremists, stating that its mission was accomplished. Despite Wagner's exit, Russia will maintain a mercenary presence through the Africa Corps, which is under the direct command of the Russian defense ministry. This transition follows the death of Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, and a shift in Russia's strategy in the region, from direct combat to training and protection services. The announcement comes amidst accusations of violence against civilians and heavy losses suffered by Wagner and the Malian army in recent attacks. The future of Russia's presence in Mali is uncertain, but the focus is expected to shift towards training and equipment provision. </p>

          <p>The Israeli army recovered the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai national taken hostage during the Hamas-led attack in October 2023, from the Rafah area of southern Gaza. Pinta, who worked as an agricultural laborer in Israel, was likely killed in the early months of his captivity by the Mujahideen Brigades. The recovery followed information obtained from the interrogation of a captured terrorist, marking a somber end to a 20-month period of uncertainty for Pinta's family. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government to reach an agreement with Hamas to secure the release of remaining captives.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., is hosting World Pride, but some international travelers are choosing to skip the event due to travel concerns and protests against President Trump's policies. Several European governments have issued travel advisories for transgender and non-binary citizens traveling to the U.S., and some organizations are protesting Trump's LGBTQ policies. Despite these concerns, organizers have implemented increased security measures for the event. While Trump has not spoken about the celebration, a White House spokesman said that he was "fostering a sense of national pride that should be celebrated daily".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's upcoming Spending Review will reveal significant increases in public spending, with total real-terms expenditure projected to exceed Â£650 billion by 2029-30, approximately Â£100 billion more than when Labour took office. However, the distribution of these funds is causing internal disputes, particularly between the Home Office and the Treasury, with some departments feeling shortchanged while others, like the NHS, receive substantial allocations. While the Chancellor aims to present a picture of significant investment, the review's impact on individual departments and public services remains unclear until the full details are released. The review is expected to prioritize long-term projects and maintain tight control over short-term spending.</p>
