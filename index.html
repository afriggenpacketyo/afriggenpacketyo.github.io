          <p>Ryan Routh has been found guilty on all five counts for the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Florida golf course. Following the verdict, Routh was forcibly removed from the courtroom after an outburst where he attempted to harm himself with a pen. His daughter also reacted emotionally before being escorted out, adding to the chaotic scene. Routh, who represented himself despite having no legal experience, will be sentenced in December and faces a potential life sentence.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Noni Madueke is expected to be out of action for six to eight weeks due to a knee injury he sustained during a recent match against Manchester City. Fortunately, the club does not believe the 23-year-old winger suffered a more severe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The injury is a significant setback for both Arsenal and the England national team, as Madueke had a promising start to the season. His absence will be felt in key domestic and European fixtures, and he is set to miss England's upcoming international matches.</p>

          <p>During a lengthy address at the UN General Assembly, President Donald Trump touched on numerous global topics, dismissing climate change efforts as a "scam" and criticizing allies for recognizing Palestinian statehood. He urged world leaders to focus instead on securing the release of hostages held by Hamas. The speech also covered his views on migration, warning allies that their countries are being negatively impacted. Following the address, it was confirmed that Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Washington D.C. next month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Mayo Clinic study finds that over half of heart attacks in women under 65 are caused by factors other than clogged arteries, such as arterial tears (SCAD) and embolisms. These nontraditional causes are frequently misdiagnosed, leading to less effective or even harmful treatments. The research highlights a significant difference from men, for whom clogged arteries account for 75% of heart attacks. Experts emphasize the need for clinicians to be more aware of these varied causes to improve diagnosis and long-term outcomes for younger patients, particularly women.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has described the combination of rising inflation and a hiring slowdown as a "challenging situation" for the U.S. economy. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell noted that downside risks to employment have increased, which informed the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates for the first time this year. He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding inflation's path and the dual-sided risks the central bank must navigate. The remarks highlight the delicate balance the Fed is trying to strike to manage prices while supporting the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests FCC Chair's Threats Against Networks Are More About Regulatory Pressure Than License Revocation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the controversy surrounding 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' suggests that FCC Chair Brendan Carr's threats to revoke broadcast licenses are legally tenuous and unlikely to succeed. The article posits that the real pressure on companies like Disney, Nexstar, and Sinclair comes from the FCC's regulatory power over mergers and acquisitions. By creating a politically charged environment, the chair can influence corporate behavior, as companies seeking approval for major deals have an incentive to stay in his good graces. This dynamic, rather than the direct threat of license cancellation, is presented as the primary driver of the networks' actions.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump criticized the organization's effectiveness and physical infrastructure.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a decree officially classifying the Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization. The White House described Antifa as a "militarist, anarchist enterprise" aiming to overthrow the U.S. government through violence and terrorism. This designation directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle the movement's operations and funding sources. Legal experts have previously raised concerns about such a classification, noting that Antifa is a decentralized movement without a formal structure, which complicates enforcement and raises First Amendment questions about criminalizing political beliefs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the transnational gang Barrio 18 as a foreign terrorist organization. The department cited the group's history of violent attacks on officials and civilians in Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This designation places Barrio 18 alongside other criminal groups like MS-13 and major drug cartels on the U.S. terror list. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to dismantle gangs and cartels, enabling the use of additional tools and sanctions to disrupt their operations and funding.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pushed back against accusations that the central bank's decisions are politically motivated, calling such claims a "cheap shot." Without naming President Trump directly, Powell defended the Fed's independence amid an ongoing pressure campaign from the White House for more significant interest rate cuts. His comments underscore the tension between the administration and the central bank over economic policy. Powell reiterated that the Fed's decisions are driven by economic data, not political considerations, in order to maintain stability.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from CDC researchers, infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" have increased by nearly 70% in the United States between 2019 and 2023. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort treatments. Experts express grave concern over this trend, which may be linked to increased antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of these bacteria could make common infections, like urinary tract infections, much more difficult to treat in the future.</p>
