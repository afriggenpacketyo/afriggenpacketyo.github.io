          <p>The UK is dealing with the extensive aftermath of Storm Floris, which caused significant disruption across the country, particularly in Scotland. Around 50,000 homes lost power, and widespread travel was affected with numerous train and flight cancellations. The storm, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, prompted an emergency meeting by the Scottish government. Cleanup and power restoration efforts are ongoing, with authorities advising the public to check travel plans and expect continued delays.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is scheduled to execute Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate convicted of a 1988 triple murder, in a case drawing national attention. The execution is considered unprecedented because Black has a working implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in his chest, raising concerns about the potential for a prolonged and painful death. Despite legal challenges and appeals from his attorneys, who argue the device could deliver painful shocks, the governor and courts have allowed the execution to proceed. The state disputes that Black would feel any shocks from the device during the lethal injection process.</p>

The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has advised affected students to contact their schools for their results.

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis of England's cricket team points to a heavy reliance on captain Ben Stokes for success. The article posits that England's upcoming Ashes tour in Australia presents their best chance of victory in over a decade, but this potential rests almost entirely on Stokes's shoulders. With Stokes recovering from a shoulder injury and the team having a poor recent record in Australia, his ability to perform as an all-rounder and leader is deemed critical. The piece assesses the strengths and weaknesses of both the English and Australian squads ahead of the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial into an alleged coup plot. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ruled that Bolsonaro violated previous precautionary measures by communicating with supporters at a rally through his son's phone. This judicial action occurs amid heightened political tensions, including a trade dispute with the U.S. Trump administration, which has condemned the court's decision and sanctioned the judge. Bolsonaro's lawyers plan to appeal the ruling, which has intensified the political divide in Brazil.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the St. Louis Cardinals in a 3-2 loss, despite a strong seven-inning performance from starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Both Glasnow and Cardinals' starter Sonny Gray dominated, each allowing only one run, but the game was ultimately decided by the bullpens. A go-ahead home run in the eighth for the Cardinals was answered by the Dodgers, but a two-out single in the ninth inning secured the victory for St. Louis. Freddie Freeman hit a solo home run for the Dodgers, continuing his recent hot streak at the plate.</p>

Key points of contention include setting targets for cutting single-use plastic production and establishing universal design standards for recycling.

          <p>Less than two years after a celebrated election victory ousted Poland's national populist party, the new liberal democratic government led by Donald Tusk is struggling with declining support. The article argues that this situation exemplifies a broader pattern where post-populist leaders fail to offer a compelling future vision, getting bogged down in reversing their predecessors' actions. Tusk's government has been criticized for co-opting some populist policies and rhetoric, leading to voter frustration and a potential return of the right-wing. The analysis suggests that simply defeating populists at the ballot box is insufficient without an inspiring, forward-looking agenda.</p>

Despite some other global militaries moving away from this type of aircraft for modern warfare, Beijing seems committed to the technology.

          <p>Australia has announced a major defense deal to acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement is described as the largest-ever defense industry deal between the two nations, strengthening their strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific. This purchase is part of Australia's significant military restructuring aimed at developing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. The first three warships will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties alleging the company illegally disposed of hazardous waste. The lawsuit claimed that UPS sent corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials from its facilities to local landfills not equipped to handle such waste. According to the Riverside County District Attorney's office, UPS was cooperative with the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for supplemental environmental projects.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, a period from August to December when the large, fuzzy spiders are more commonly seen. During this time, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, sometimes traveling long distances. Experts note that sightings are common in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas, including popular hiking spots in the Greater Los Angeles region like Griffith Park and Malibu Creek State Park. While their appearance can be intimidating, tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked.</p>

          <p>Communities across the U.S. are facing a critical shortage of volunteer firefighters, who make up nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews. The number of volunteers has dropped by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled, leading to burnout and strained resources. This decline threatens public safety in smaller communities and could force more towns to switch to paid fire departments, a move that would significantly increase taxpayer costs. Lawmakers are considering incentives, such as student loan forgiveness, to help recruit and retain more volunteers for these essential roles.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Donald Trump posted on social media in support of the company's advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The campaign had faced some online criticism, which Trump used as an opportunity to decry "woke" advertising while praising the "HOTTEST" ad from American Eagle. The president's endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the retailer, which has been facing financial headwinds, including a recent withdrawal of its full-year guidance due to slow sales and steep discounting.

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that Taiwan's critical energy reserves would be rapidly exhausted in the event of a military blockade by China.

However, the report also concludes that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States.

Among the uncollected winnings are 11 prizes worth £100,000 each. Critics argue the process is particularly difficult for those who were gifted bonds or only have old paper records, making it hard to track down accounts during a cost of living crisis.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, which is linked to a rise in screening rates for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening uptake grew by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This has resulted in more cancers being caught at a more treatable stage, which researchers call promising news. However, the study also highlights that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable, particularly based on education and insurance status.</p>
