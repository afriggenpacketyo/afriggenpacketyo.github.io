          <p>Jared Wise, a former FBI agent who was pardoned by President Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been appointed to a position within the Justice Department. Sources confirm Wise is now serving as an investigator and counselor in the "Weaponization Working Group." He was on trial for charges including egging on rioters to attack police, with video evidence showing him yelling "Kill 'em!" repeatedly. This controversial appointment has drawn scrutiny, given his past actions and the nature of his pardon, which covered nearly all individuals charged in the Capitol attack.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors, including nurses and healthcare advocates, gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to federal programs like Medicaid while extending tax cuts for the wealthy. Protestors argued the cuts are cruel and will harm vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and disabled individuals who rely on Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program. Rep. Kim, whose district has a significant number of Medicaid recipients, stated she voted to protect and strengthen these services.</p>

          <p>The "Quad" nationsâ€”the United States, Japan, India, and Australiaâ€”have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals essential for modern technology. The move is widely seen as an effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the market for these resources. In a joint statement, the group expressed concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The announcement came after a meeting of foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., where they emphasized strengthening strategic stability and maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking their legal status and work permits in September, a plan that would have ended protections far ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge argued that the DHS Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting the executive branch's authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone, a massive resort complex capable of hosting nearly 20,000 people, as part of a state-led push to stimulate its economy through tourism. State media reported that North Koreans were enjoying swimming and water park attractions at the new facility. The project is central to leader Kim Jong Un's economic development plans, though its success remains uncertain as the country's borders are still largely closed to foreign visitors. While a small number of Russian tourists are expected, the key Chinese tour groups have not yet resumed.</p>

          <p>North Korean state media released footage showing leader Kim Jong Un emotionally mourning over the coffin of a soldier reportedly killed while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The images, which included Kim placing a flag on a casket, were part of a broadcast marking the anniversary of a strategic partnership treaty with Moscow. Other photos showed North Korean soldiers alongside Russian troops and a bloodstained notebook allegedly recovered from a battlefield. This report provides a rare, state-sanctioned glimpse into North Korea's direct involvement and losses in the Russia-Ukraine war, reinforcing the deepening military alliance between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs announced it has reached a verdict on four of the five counts against him but is deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. The judge has instructed the jurors to continue deliberating in an attempt to reach a unanimous decision on all charges, which include sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution. The racketeering charge is particularly complex, requiring prosecutors to prove Combs established a coordinated criminal enterprise. The outcome of the deliberations, which will resume Wednesday, remains uncertain after two months of testimony from 34 witnesses.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the U.S. has paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing a need to prioritize "America's interests" following a Department of Defense review. The decision comes amid concerns within the Trump administration about depleting U.S. military stockpiles, with air defense missiles and precision munitions reportedly among the affected items. This policy shift occurs as Russia intensifies its attacks and shortly after President Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky. The move represents a significant change in U.S. support for Ukraine, creating uncertainty for Kyiv as it continues to defend against the full-scale Russian invasion.</p>

The chaotic episode has been compared to the parliamentary turmoil of the Brexit era and has left the Prime Minister weakened and his agenda in disarray.

Trump praised the facility and its deterrent qualities, remarking that alligators could serve as unpaid "bodyguards." The site, which can house up to 3,000 people, is part of a broader plan to establish similar centers in other states to accelerate deportations, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from opponents who decry it as an inhumane prison camp.</p>

Trump retaliated by suggesting Musk could lose more than just his "EV mandate," alluding to the substantial government contracts and subsidies his companies like SpaceX and Tesla rely on.

This development follows previous stalled negotiations and comes as President Trump is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week to discuss both Gaza and Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature legislative proposal, formally known as HR 1, is a massive 940-page bill that has generated significant controversy and debate. Its key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, expanding the child tax credit, and allocating $170 billion for defense and border security. However, it also proposes major spending cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid, which provides healthcare to millions of low-income Americans. Critics, including former ally Elon Musk, have condemned the bill for potentially adding trillions to the national debt, while supporters champion it as essential for Trump's second-term agenda.

The committee deemed the universities' previous responses to document requests "inadequate." The investigation, which also includes Harvard, could lead to legislative reforms regarding anticompetitive practices in higher education and is part of a broader scrutiny of elite institutions.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing confidential Medicaid recipient data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that federal health officials unlawfully transferred sensitive personal informationâ€”including names, addresses, and immigration statusâ€”to be used for immigration enforcement. The states argue this action violates federal privacy laws and creates a climate of fear that could deter people from seeking necessary medical care. The administration defends the data sharing as a legal and necessary measure to crack down on fraud and misuse of federal funds.</p>

However, the comprehensive research found that USAID funding was associated with saving over 90 million lives in the past two decades, particularly by reducing deaths from HIV/AIDS and malaria.

          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay a transfer fee for Trent Alexander-Arnold, rather than waiting a month to sign him for free, appears to have been a successful gamble. The club wanted him in time for the Club World Cup, and his performance has already proven valuable. An assist from Alexander-Arnold for a goal by striker Gonzalo Garcia helped secure a win over Juventus, advancing the team and earning the club an extra Â£10 million in prize money, more than covering the initial fee. The right-back is adapting well to his new team and the tactical system of coach Xabi Alonso, showing promising signs for his future at the club.</p>
