          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple detained by ICE, accusing the government of lacking meaningful evidence to support claims of their gang affiliation. Julio Cesar Sanchez-Puentes and Luddis Norelia Sanchez-García, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), were arrested and released twice in March before their TPS status was withdrawn. Judge David Briones criticized ICE's declarations, stating they failed to provide sufficient evidence of the couple's alleged association with a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The couple's attorneys argued their clients were wrongly designated as 'alien enemies' and faced severe consequences, including potential life sentences.</p>

          <p>Sam Antar, cousin of "Crazy Eddie" and a convicted fraudster turned fraud expert, alleges that New York Attorney General Letitia James misrepresented her financial situation to obtain favorable loans. Antar claims his independent investigation uncovered documents dating back to 1983 indicating James falsified records. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has also sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department regarding these allegations. James denies the accusations, claiming they are a "revenge tour" orchestrated by Donald Trump due to the civil fraud lawsuit she successfully pursued against him. The FHFA accuses James of falsifying records to meet certain lending requirements and score favorable loan terms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated his goal to broker a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war within "two weeks or less," following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican. Trump expressed disappointment with Russia's continued missile and drone strikes in Ukraine after he implored Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the attacks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that Russia and Ukraine are closer to a deal but emphasized the need for verification and security guarantees, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voiced concerns that Trump might concede too much to Putin. Trump stated that Ukraine reclaiming its territory in Crimea that Russia occupied in 2014 would be complicated.</p>

          <p>Newly surfaced evidence from the 9/11 investigation, including a video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol, was not shared with FBI field agents or top intelligence officials, raising concerns about the thoroughness of the original investigation. The video, recorded in 1999 by Omar al-Bayoumi, who investigators believe was a Saudi intelligence operative, shows detailed surveillance of the Capitol building. Retired FBI agents and CIA analysts express surprise that this evidence, along with an airplane sketch and math formula seized from Bayoumi's apartment, was not properly disseminated or analyzed, potentially hindering efforts to build a stronger case against Bayoumi and uncover the full extent of al-Qaeda's planning.</p>

          <p>Japan's population has been declining for 15 years, leading to concerns about the economy, labor shortages, and societal stability. The falling population is partly attributed to the success of women in the workforce, a challenging work culture, and a decline in marriage rates. Businesses are adapting by catering to single customers, and alternative forms of romance are gaining popularity. The government is implementing initiatives like dating apps and four-day workweeks to encourage relationships and boost birth rates, while some advocate for a shift away from urban living to revitalize rural communities.</p>

          <p>Significant budget cuts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Trump administration are raising concerns about the future of medical research and public health.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 19:04:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been confirmed as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which were wrecked in 1710. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum identified the vessels through investigations of ship timbers, cargo bricks, and clay pipes found during underwater excavations. The Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, while the Christianus Quintus was wrecked in the surf. The findings shed light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but did not abolish until 1847.</p>

          <p>A leading health think tank reports that urgent and emergency care in England is performing significantly worse than before the pandemic, with A&E waiting times reaching record highs. The Health Foundation attributes this to persistent issues like delays in discharging patients, which worsen bottlenecks in A&E and ambulance handover delays. While flu cases were higher than usual, the report argues that blaming external factors provides "false comfort" and urges the government to address underlying systemic issues. The government is expected to release an urgent and emergency care plan soon.</p>

          <p>The UK government asserts that the Schools Bill, currently under scrutiny in the House of Lords, will reduce school uniform costs for families by limiting the number of branded items schools can require. The bill proposes a limit of three branded items, excluding school ties, aiming to save parents £50 a year. While surveys indicate that many parents find school uniforms unaffordable, the Schoolwear Association argues that the plan could increase costs. The bill also includes reforms such as free breakfast clubs and a new register for home-schooled children.</p>
