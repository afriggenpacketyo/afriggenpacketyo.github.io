          <p>Apple has announced plans to increase its investments in the United States by an additional $100 billion, bringing its four-year commitment to $600 billion. The move comes as the company faces pressure from the Trump administration to onshore more of its manufacturing and avoid significant tariffs on its products made in China. The White House has framed the announcement as a success for its economic policies aimed at reshoring production. Analysts note that while this may help Apple navigate the trade war, a significant shift in its global supply chain will take considerable time.</p>

The event was attended by various celebrities, including NBA great Dennis Rodman, who was a wrestling contemporary of Hogan in the New World Order. Hogan passed away at age 71 from a heart attack, and the gathering served as a public tribute to his legacy. His daughter, Brooke Hogan, explained she chose to grieve privately, honoring her father's dislike for the morbidity of funerals.</p>

          <p>Following an alleged assault on a former Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) staffer, President Trump has threatened to "federalize" Washington D.C., stripping it of its local governance. Citing "out of control" crime, he stated he would use federal power if the city does not address the issue, specifically calling for minors to be prosecuted as adults. The threat, supported by Elon Musk, follows the reported assault of a 19-year-old who was attacked by a group of youths. This move would revoke the city's "home rule" status, a significant action that would likely face strong political and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Jesse Calhoun, a man already accused of killing three women in the Portland area, has been indicted for a fourth murder. A grand jury charged him in the November 2022 death of 22-year-old Kristin Smith, whose remains were found months before the other victims. The discovery of multiple bodies in a 100-mile radius had initially sparked fears of a serial killer in the region. Calhoun was arrested in 2023 on unrelated parole warrants after his early release for fighting wildfires was revoked by the governor.</p>

          <h2>New Study Reveals Trees Host Vast and Diverse Microbiomes of Up to One Trillion Cells</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the journal Nature has discovered that trees possess rich internal microbiomes, similar to those in the human body, containing up to one trillion microbial cells. Researchers at Yale University found that different tree species host distinct communities of fungi, bacteria, and viruses that are specialized to different parts of the tree, such as the heartwood and sapwood. This research suggests these microbes could play a crucial role in tree health, defense, and overall forest ecosystems. The findings open a new frontier for understanding trees as complex ecosystems rather than standalone organisms.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, urging them to closely review the proposed $2.4 billion merger of Dick's Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. Warren raised antitrust concerns, arguing the deal could lead to a duopoly in the athletic footwear market, resulting in higher prices for consumers and reduced competition for smaller retailers. She highlighted the risk of the combined entity using its increased market power to secure unfavorable terms from suppliers, further squeezing independent stores. The letter calls on the agencies to block the deal if it is found to violate antitrust laws.</p>

Proponents argue that the technology holds immense promise for human health, while critics warn of the dangers of a new, market-based eugenics and the unforeseen risks of altering the human germline.

          <p>Germany is re-evaluating its process for designating 'safe countries of origin' for migrants following a European Court of Justice ruling. The court affirmed that fast-tracking asylum procedures for applicants from these countries is permissible, but only if the designation is based on transparent sources and subject to judicial review. This has implications for Germany's plans to expand its list to include countries like Algeria and Tunisia, where LGBTQ+ individuals face persecution. The ruling complicates the German government's efforts to streamline deportations and limit what it deems illegal migration.</p>

          <p>Claire's, the mall-based retailer known for tween accessories and ear piercing, has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in seven years. The company is struggling with significant debt, declining sales, and increased costs from tariffs on its goods, which are primarily sourced from China. In its filing, the CEO cited intense online competition from rivals like Shein and a general shift away from brick-and-mortar shopping as key factors. While its North American stores will remain open during the process, the bankruptcy highlights the severe challenges facing traditional mall retailers.</p>

President Trump has expressed growing frustration with the lack of progress and the continuing civilian casualties in Ukraine. In a related development, several European NATO allies have committed over a billion dollars to purchase U.S. weapons to send to Ukraine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell over 7% after the company's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. CEO Lisa Su attributed some of the miss to U.S. export controls on AI chips, which have effectively halted certain sales to China. The company's guidance for the next quarter did not account for potential revenue from its chip designed for the China market, creating uncertainty about the timing of a restart in shipments. Despite the miss, AMD's overall revenue grew 32% year-over-year, but investor concerns about the datacenter business and China sales weighed on the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the significant global economic impact if India and China were to halt purchases of Russian oil due to U.S. secondary sanctions. Such a move would remove roughly 5 million barrels per day from the market, likely causing a dramatic spike in global oil prices and stoking inflation. India and China became Russia's top oil buyers after the West imposed sanctions over the Ukraine war, with India saving an estimated $33 billion. While President Trump has threatened penalties, analysts believe China has more economic leverage to resist than India. (not investment advice)</p>
