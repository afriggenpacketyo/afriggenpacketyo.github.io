          <p>New EPA data indicates that PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," contaminate over 200 US drinking water systems, affecting more than 172 million people. These chemicals, found in many products, accumulate in the body and are linked to severe health risks like cancer and immune suppression. While the EPA set limits, some deadlines have been pushed back, and certain PFAS limits reduced. Utilities are exploring filtration systems and suing polluters to recover costs, underscoring the urgent need to address this widespread public health issue.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has discovered 41 new landslides on the moon that have formed since 2009, attributing them to moonquakes. Published in the National Science Review, this finding challenges previous geological wisdom that lunar endogenic activity had largely ceased. The team used comparative analysis of before-and-after images of unstable lunar areas to detect these events. This article highlights the ongoing geological activity on the moon, which is crucial for future human infrastructure and deep-space outposts.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts Laws to Limit Federal Immigration Enforcement and Enhance Resident Protections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 23:22:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several bills aimed at curbing federal immigration enforcement within the state, including the "No Secret Police Act." This new law bans federal and local law enforcement, including ICE, from wearing face coverings while on duty and requires officers to be identifiable. The legislation, which also protects children in schools and restricts officers from entering non-public hospital areas without warrants, is a response to the Supreme Court's ruling allowing immigration stops based on appearance. This article highlights California's resistance to what it terms "authoritarian tendencies" from the federal administration.</p>
