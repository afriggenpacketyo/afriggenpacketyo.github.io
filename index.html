          <p>A massive far-right rally, led by activist Tommy Robinson and drawing an estimated 110,000 participants, packed central London, expressing anger over immigration and perceived free speech restrictions. The demonstration, dubbed "Unite the Kingdom," saw speeches from international far-right figures and was met by a smaller counter-protest organized by anti-racism groups. Police deployed extensively to maintain separation, with some officers reportedly assaulted by rally participants. This significant event underscores rising anti-immigration sentiment and ongoing societal divisions in Britain, following recent controversies over free speech and government actions.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking $3.1 million in fines from Boeing for safety violations between September 2023 and February 2024, including issues related to the January 2024 Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 door plug blowout. A comprehensive investigation found manufacturing and safety oversight lapses at Boeing and its subcontractor, along with pressure on an FAA inspection unit to approve an aircraft prematurely. Boeing stated it is reviewing the proposed penalty and has implemented a safety and quality plan under FAA oversight to enhance production standards and strengthen its safety culture. This incident adds to ongoing troubles for the 737 Max series following previous fatal crashes, highlighting persistent challenges in aviation safety.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was assassinated during an outdoor debate, an event described by officials as a "targeted attack." Robinson's father reportedly urged him to surrender after recognizing him from released photos, leading to his capture by marshals and the FBI. Messages reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle and engraved bullets with politically charged inscriptions. This incident, which drew widespread condemnation, highlights a deeply concerning instance of political violence in the United States.</p>

          <p>California's Legislature has passed several significant and controversial bills aimed at transforming the public school experience for 5.8 million students, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature. Key measures include Assembly Bill 715, creating a state Office for Civil Rights to combat various forms of discrimination, including antisemitism, a move opposed by some who fear it could stifle classroom discussion. Assembly Bill 1454 mandates phonics-based "science of reading" instruction to improve literacy rates, while Assembly Bill 1264 seeks to eliminate ultra-processed foods from school meals. Other notable bills address truancy reform and cannabis tax revenue allocation affecting child care funding.</p>

The stroke forced the band to postpone parts of their Las Vegas residency, but Neil has since made a significant recovery, returning to the stage at 90-95% of his former capacity. His remarkable determination to perform again highlights a powerful personal triumph over a serious health challenge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Memphis, Tennessee, will be the next U.S. city to receive National Guard troops as part of his ongoing crackdown on crime in Democrat-led cities. Memphis Mayor Paul Young expressed his strong displeasure, stating he learned of the deployment via Fox News and did not request it, despite acknowledging prior discussions about federal support. Young highlighted Memphis's high crime rates but voiced concerns about the historical implications of military presence in the city, preferring financial resources and additional police officers. This move marks an escalation in Trump's use of federal troops, following a similar deployment in Washington D.C., and signals potential friction between federal and local authorities.</p>

          <p>The Taliban regime's top diplomat, Amir Khan Muttaqi, reportedly met with U.S. special envoy Adam Boehler and former envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to discuss developing bilateral relations, citizen issues, and investment opportunities in Afghanistan. While the Taliban published photos, the U.S. has not officially corroborated the claims or recognized the Taliban government. The meeting follows the recent release of U.S. citizen George Glezmann, abducted in 2022, and reflects President Trump's stated priority of securing the freedom of U.S. detainees abroad. Future talks are anticipated, particularly concerning other imprisoned citizens, amidst ongoing diplomatic complexities and the U.S. non-recognition of the Taliban regime.</p>

          <p>Before appointing Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reportedly questioned him about his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This inquiry followed initial vetting that flagged the relationship, but new information, including supportive emails Mandelson sent to Epstein after his 2008 conviction, emerged this week, leading to Mandelson's dismissal. Downing Street sources suggest Mandelson was "economical with the truth" in his responses, raising significant scrutiny over Sir Keir's judgment and the thoroughness of the vetting process. The controversy has sparked calls for accountability within the government and further questions about the extent of prior knowledge.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a stellar week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record highs, fueled by speculation about the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision and strong earnings from Oracle. Oracle's fiscal Q1 report, showing a 359% surge in contracted revenue, boosted chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom, signaling continued AI infrastructure demand. Mixed economic data, including a lower-than-expected August producer price index but higher consumer prices, complicated the Fed's decision, yet rising jobless claims suggested potential economic softness that could lead to more aggressive rate cuts. The Investing Club made several trades, including buying Boeing and Texas Roadhouse, and trimming Goldman Sachs, while analyzing updates from Wells Fargo and GE Vernova. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump sought to fire Cook, alleging she simultaneously claimed two properties as primary residences to secure better loan terms. However, Cook's security clearance form also described the property as a "second home," and Fulton County tax records show no homestead exemption claimed on the condo. Cook has secured an injunction against her firing, but the Justice Department has opened an investigation into the allegations, prolonging the legal and political dispute.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer has denied knowledge of a scheme to circumvent the NBA's salary cap involving Kawhi Leonard and a now-bankrupt company, Aspiration, which Ballmer partially funded. The Clippers are accused of funneling $28 million to Leonard through a "no-show" endorsement deal. Ballmer stated he only introduced the deal to Leonard and was unaware of the contract's specifics or amount, claiming he was "conned" by Aspiration's fraudulent founders. The NBA has launched an investigation into the allegations, which could have significant implications for the team, its star player, and the league's integrity, raising questions about financial transparency in sports.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to NATO allies, stating he is prepared to impose "major" sanctions on Russia only if all NATO nations cease buying Russian oil and implement similar sanctions. He also suggested imposing 50% to 100% tariffs on China for its continued purchases of Russian petroleum, believing these drastic steps would quickly end the war in Ukraine. Trump criticized NATO's commitment, highlighting that some members, like Turkey, Hungary, and Slovakia, continue to import Russian energy. This stance represents a significant shift in potential policy and could create considerable rifts within the alliance, complicating international efforts.</p>

          <p>Georgia prosecutors faced a major setback as a judge dismissed RICO conspiracy charges against 61 defendants in the "Cop City" protest case, citing the Attorney General's lack of authority to bring the case without gubernatorial permission. This decision, nearly three years after arrests, invalidates most of the indictment, which critics called "overblown" and politically motivated. The collapse of the case highlights prosecutorial overreach and procedural negligence, drawing comparisons to other high-profile protest prosecutions. Opponents of the $109 million police training center celebrate the ruling as a victory for civil rights and a rebuke of attempts to criminalize dissent, affirming judicial checks on government power.</p>

          <p>Popular lip oils, while offering cosmetic shine and hydration, can potentially cause issues like hyperpigmentation if they lack SPF or contain irritants, according to dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Small. The thin skin on lips is particularly vulnerable to sun damage and inflammation, which can increase melanin production. Some users, particularly women of color, have reported intense hyperpigmentation from certain trending products. Dr. Small strongly recommends choosing lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF and actively avoiding common fragrances like peppermint or cinnamon, while favoring beneficial ingredients such as linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid for safer use and optimal lip health.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to commence its first migrant deportation flights to France next week under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme, part of a deal between Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron. This agreement stipulates that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers who have not attempted Channel crossings and pass security checks. The policy aims to tackle small boat crossings, which have increased significantly this year, but faces criticism from opponents for being potentially "unworkable and wide open to abuse." Formal removal directions have been issued to asylum seekers for imminent deportation.</p>
