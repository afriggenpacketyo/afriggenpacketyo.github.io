          <p>A U.S. attorney in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, appointed by Donald Trump, is reportedly proceeding with plans to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. This controversial decision emerges despite career prosecutors and investigators concluding there was insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for perjury or obstruction charges, as detailed in a memo recommending against charges. Halligan, who lacks prior criminal prosecution experience, is expected to present the case to a grand jury before the statute of limitations expires, directly influenced by Trump's public demands for Comey's prosecution. This development highlights ongoing concerns regarding potential political interference within the Justice Department, raising questions about legal impartiality and the integrity of the judicial process in high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Violet Affleck, daughter of actor Ben Affleck, recently addressed the United Nations, advocating passionately for clean air infrastructure, the reinstatement of mask mandates, and the recognition of filtered air as a fundamental human right. The 19-year-old Yale freshman's impactful speech underscored the critical importance of environmental health. An expert, Rocky Rosen, highlighted the personal context that her father, Ben Affleck, reportedly struggles with a decades-long smoking habit, suggesting Violet feels a sense of powerlessness regarding this private health concern. This article draws a poignant parallel between her public activism for global clean air and the ongoing challenges within her own family regarding personal air quality and health choices.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has officially formed in the central Atlantic, with meteorologists forecasting a continued northwestward movement and steady strengthening over the next several days. This storm marks the eighth named system of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Gabrielle, which is not impacting land. While no coastal watches or warnings are currently in effect, experts are closely monitoring Humberto's potential to bring downstream impacts to areas of the Southeast U.S. coast, stretching from Florida up to North Carolina. Concurrently, a second system in the northeast Caribbean is also under observation, expected to develop into a tropical depression later this week and potentially bring significant rainfall to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading results on Thursday, influenced by a continued sell-off of major tech stocks like Nvidia and Oracle on Wall Street for a second consecutive day. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight decline, while the broader Topix index registered a modest gain, and South Korea's Kospi edged up marginally. Heightened investor skepticism regarding the potentially circular nature of the AI industry contributed to these movements, notably impacting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Additionally, investors in Hong Kong awaited Chinese automaker Chery Automobile's listing, which was reportedly affected by Super Typhoon Ragasa, while also anticipating U.S. jobless claims data that could influence Federal Reserve monetary policy amid concerns about a weakening labor market.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 21:20:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), characterized the recent shooting at a Dallas processing facility as an "indiscriminate" attack that "could have been worse." The incident resulted in one detainee's death and left two others in critical condition, though no agency employees were harmed. Lyons noted that the shooter, who later died by suicide, fired a high-powered rifle from a nearby rooftop into the ICE field office and vehicles, including one carrying recently arrested detainees. He emphasized the deliberate targeting of federal law enforcement, citing anti-ICE messages found on bullet casings. Lyons confirmed ICE operations would continue unabated, but security protocols would undergo reevaluation following this serious assault.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers from several US states, including Wisconsin, have filed a formal complaint with the EPA, seeking to hold Canada accountable for smoke from its wildfires drifting south and impacting American air quality. Manitoba's premier dismissed these actions as "political games," highlighting the severe devastation within Canada, where 2025 is on track to be the second-worst wildfire season on record. A recent study revealed that smoke from Canada's 2023 wildfires, the worst ever, caused over 87,500 acute and premature deaths worldwide due to PM2.5 pollution. Experts from both nations emphasize that climate change is the fundamental cause of worsening wildfires, urging international cooperation rather than a blame game to address this global health and environmental crisis.</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey is starring in "The Lost Bus," a film depicting the harrowing escape from California's deadly 2018 wildfires, where he plays a bus driver evacuating schoolchildren. Notably, his 93-year-old mother, Mary Kathlene 'Kay' McConaughey, and 17-year-old son, Levi, also appear in the film, making it a unique family affair. Director Paul Greengrass, known for his realism, cast McConaughey's family members, with Levi earning his role after persistent requests and a blind audition. The film recreates the inferno using gas lines and visual effects, aiming for a realistic cinematic experience that also speaks to the universal dangers of a world "on fire" due to climate change.</p>

This effort was prompted by the recent felony charges against a Costa Mesa woman who allegedly registered her dog and cast ballots for it in two elections. Supervisors Dan Wagner and Janet Nguyen championed the measure, aiming to bolster public confidence in election integrity, though some colleagues argued the focus should instead be on increasing legitimate voter participation. The Registrar of Voters has already conducted an initial review of nearly 8,000 unincorporated pet records without detecting any issues and is now expanding this scrutiny to incorporated cities, working to maintain accurate voter rolls.</p>

          <p>Leaked documents and data reveal that England's Environment Agency (EA) is struggling to monitor serious pollution incidents, often failing to send investigators to affected sites. In 2024, the EA did not attend nearly a third of serious water industry incidents and downgraded over 1,000 potentially serious incidents without in-person inspection, often relying on water companies for information. Critics argue this allows polluters to act with impunity, citing examples of chemical spills and prolonged sewage overflows that went uninvestigated by the EA. The agency maintains it responds to all incidents but uses various assessment methods, facing calls for a national crisis response and a merger of water regulators.</p>

          <p>Former US President Barack Obama characterized the United States as being in the midst of a "tug of war" between two divergent visions for its future, while delivering remarks in London. He criticized populist movements, including those led by Donald Trump, for promoting a return to an older, more conservative worldview where the concept of "we, the people" is interpreted as exclusive rather than inclusive. Obama also pointedly admonished progressives, suggesting they became "smug" and "complacent" in the 1990s and 2000s, believing their values were unchallenged, but now face significant tests. This commentary underscores Obama's deep concern about the nation's ideological divisions and the ongoing struggle for its identity and democratic principles.</p>

He alleged that an escalator carrying him and the First Lady "stopped on a dime," his teleprompter went "stone cold dark" during his speech, and his microphone system was faulty, making his remarks inaudible to world leaders. Trump demanded an "immediate" investigation, suggesting a conspiracy and involving the Secret Service. UN officials, however, attributed the escalator stop to a US delegation videographer inadvertently triggering a safety function, and noted the White House operates the teleprompter. This incident, dubbed "escalatorgate," added a combative tone to Trump's UN address.</p>

This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's broader push to revoke funding from "sanctuary" cities and states. Twenty predominantly Democratic states had initiated the lawsuit, contending that the policy violated federal law and the Constitution by effectively holding crucial emergency preparedness and response funding hostage. The judge sided with the plaintiff states, granting summary judgment and deeming the policy "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," underscoring the potential for irreparable harm to disaster response and public safety if such funds were withheld.</p>

Experts warn this policy could stifle innovation, lead to a "brain drain," and prompt companies to offshore operations rather than hire US workers.

Prosecutors, who had advocated for a 10-year sentence, argued Rodriguez ambushed Morin without identifying himself as an officer and delayed calling for medical assistance, leading to Morin bleeding to death.

          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has called for "realism" regarding the club's European ambitions, following their Europa League opening draw away to Red Star Belgrade. This sentiment marks a notable shift from previous seasons, particularly after Celtic's failure to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in three years, which has led to fan protests over a "scant summer of transfer activity." While the draw was considered a valuable point in a challenging away fixture, the article underscores the contrast with Rodgers' earlier confidence about the team's Champions League readiness. The positive impact of new signing Kelechi Iheanacho, who provided a crucial focal point, is highlighted, yet the club continues to face criticism for not adequately replacing departed star players.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring financial support options for companies in Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, following a cyber-attack in late August that halted JLR's car production. With factories suspended until next month, fears are growing that smaller suppliers, heavily reliant on JLR, could face bankruptcy. Ideas under consideration include the government purchasing component parts to keep suppliers afloat or providing government-backed loans, though a Covid-style furlough scheme has been ruled out. The Business and Trade Select Committee is meeting to gather testimony, highlighting deep concern for the tens of thousands of workers in the affected supply chain, as the cyber-attack is costing JLR at least £50m weekly.

          <p>The BBC, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP), and Reuters have jointly released a short film advocating for Israel to permit foreign journalists independent access to Gaza. Narrated by David Dimbleby, the film underscores the critical need for international reporters to work alongside Palestinian journalists, who have borne the sole burden of reporting since Israel's 2023 offensive. Foreign journalists have been banned from independent entry since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks, with only controlled access under Israeli military escort. The initiative, launched during the UN General Assembly, highlights the severe risks faced by local journalists, with at least 248 Palestinian journalists reportedly killed in Israeli attacks.</p>

          <p>Counterfeit Labubu dolls have alarmingly constituted 90% of the £3.5 million worth of fake toys seized at the UK border this year, according to recent Home Office data. These popular quirky monster characters, marketed primarily as adult collectibles but also widely desired by young people, frequently fail crucial safety tests, often containing harmful chemicals or presenting choking hazards. The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has launched its "Fake Toys, Real Harms" campaign to highlight these dangers, noting that a significant 70% of fake toy buyers prioritize cost over safety. The IPO warns that the Labubu trend is merely "the tip of the iceberg," urging parents and consumers to be vigilant against dangerous fakes that bypass all regulatory safety checks and can lead to illnesses in children.</p>

          <p>Over a thousand disabled children across the UK are currently on extensive waiting lists for essential wheelchairs and mobility equipment, a situation so critical that the charity Whizz Kidz has been compelled to close its specialist waitlist for the first time in its 35-year history. Escalating costs and severely constrained NHS budgets are cited as the primary causes for this "huge demand," resulting in prolonged delays that profoundly affect children's independence and overall quality of life. Families, such as Wren's, whose 11-year-old daughter with cerebral palsy requires a powered wheelchair but is deemed ineligible by the NHS, describe the immense emotional and physical toll these waits inflict. Whizz Kidz has launched its "Childhood Can't Wait" appeal, aiming to raise £750,000 to reopen the waitlist and alleviate these critical delays.</p>

          <p>UK Science Minister Lord Patrick Vallance has asserted that increases in the price the NHS pays for medicines will be "necessary" to counteract a trend of pharmaceutical investment departing the UK. This statement comes in the wake of recent decisions by major drug companies, such as Merck and AstraZeneca, to either pause or entirely scrap significant UK projects. Industry analysts and critics point to factors including low prices for new drugs, a perceived lack of government investment, and tariff pressures from US President Donald Trump as driving forces behind this exodus. Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirmed active discussions between government departments and the pharma industry on drug pricing, noting the UK's medicine spending has declined significantly as a percentage of the NHS budget compared to other developed nations.
