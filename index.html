          <p>Japan has conveyed its "deep concerns" to Israel regarding the ongoing conflict with Iran. The message underscores Japan's diplomatic efforts to address the escalating tensions in the Middle East, reflecting its commitment to regional stability. Japan's involvement highlights the international community's focus on de-escalation and the need for peaceful resolutions amid the conflict, which could have far-reaching implications for global security. Japan's stance demonstrates a proactive approach to international relations and conflict resolution. The article is brief and does not offer details on the specific nature of the concerns or the response from Israel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty-three Palestinians were killed near an aid distribution site in Gaza after Israeli forces opened fire, according to witnesses and medics, adding to the hundreds of Palestinians who have died in similar incidents since late May. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by the US and Israel, denied any shooting occurred near its sites, while the Israeli military has yet to comment on the incident. UNICEF has warned that the GHF's food distribution system is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis, and a lack of clarity regarding site opening times is leading to mass casualty events. Separately, an Israeli airstrike killed 11 Palestinians in Deir al-Balah, and Hamas-run civil defense officials reported numerous deaths from recent Israeli air strikes following a lull during the Israel-Iran escalation.</p>

          <p>According to a national security expert, a U.S. attack on Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant might not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The expert, Joe Cirincione, notes that the exact depth and protective measures of the facility are not fully known, and the GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, while capable of penetrating 200 feet, may not be sufficient to destroy the facility. Cirincione also points out that even if damage is inflicted, Iran possesses the knowledge, experience, enriched uranium, and centrifuges in other locations to quickly resume its nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency has stated that Iran has breached its non-proliferation agreements by illegally stockpiling enriched uranium.</p>

          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a £4.5 billion ($6 billion) loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK to address a funding shortfall. This private capital investment is significant for a project of national interest in the UK, and Apollo will offer an investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package with an interest rate below 7%. The project, which involves constructing two nuclear reactors, has faced delays and budget increases, especially after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted its funding amid tensions with the British government. When completed, Hinkley Point C is expected to supply electricity to approximately six million homes, underscoring its importance to the UK's energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, a major UK airbase, and sprayed two military planes with red paint, causing a security breach. Palestine Action claimed responsibility, stating the activists evaded security and disabled the air-to-air refuelling tankers, though the RAF is assessing the damage and expects minimal operational impact. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the act as "disgraceful vandalism," and the Ministry of Defence is conducting a security review. The activists used repurposed fire extinguishers to spray paint into the planes' engines, and the incident follows similar actions by Palestine Action targeting arms companies since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff has been in communication with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, although there are no current plans for a meeting. Officials cite heavy losses among Iran's senior leadership as a reason for allowing diplomatic efforts to proceed, while European diplomats are scheduled to hold talks with Araghchi in Geneva. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been skeptical of negotiating with Iran, but the "special relationship" with the U.S. does not necessarily translate to leverage over the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>States across the U.S. are forfeiting hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue to attract data centers, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. These tax incentives, often in the form of sales tax exemptions on equipment and power, are intended to spur economic growth, but watchdog groups argue that the facilities don't create many jobs and consume immense amounts of electricity. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states offer full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 16 of those states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. While some states, like Virginia, have seen some economic benefit from data centers, critics argue that the tax breaks are a losing proposition for taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that pandemic preparedness in the U.S. is dramatically eroding under the Trump administration, citing controversial dismissals, lackluster responses to outbreaks, and a lack of quality information from officials. Concerns include weakened virus monitoring systems and public health reductions, with the communication around measles outbreaks causing particular worry about a potential pandemic response. The H5N1 outbreak has also been plagued by incomplete information and reduced testing, and budget cuts at the CDC have further strained public health infrastructure. The administration's stance on immigration also poses challenges in detecting and treating cases, and restrictions on vaccine development could hinder the ability to respond to a pandemic.</p>

          <p>Hannah Hampton's journey to becoming an England goalkeeper has been marked by overcoming a serious eye condition and navigating challenges early in her career. Despite being a "little immature" early on, Hampton's talent was recognized, and she rose through England's ranks, making her senior debut in 2022. After being dropped from the squad due to behavioral concerns, Hampton worked to rebuild relationships and prove herself, ultimately earning a recall and a place in the Euro squad. She has demonstrated resilience and determination to overcome adversity and achieve success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent claims of a significant rightward shift among Gen Z voters are being challenged by an analysis of Cooperative Election Study data, which suggests that the youth-vote shift in 2024 was more of a one-off event than an ideological realignment. While young adults did vote for Trump at a higher rate in 2024, they have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold conservative political opinions. The data indicates that young adults are generally more liberal than previous generations on issues like immigration, race, and abortion, and their increased support for Republican candidates may be driven by dissatisfaction with the economy and a generalized pessimism.</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, *Caregiving*, explores the challenges faced by caregivers in America, highlighting the lack of resources and support for those caring for sick or elderly relatives. The film traces the history of caregiving in the U.S., from early 20th-century almshouses to the current system where caregivers often feel alone and unsupported. Medicare's decision not to cover long-term care and the limitations of Medicaid have contributed to the problem, leaving families to cobble together help and spend significant amounts of money out of pocket. While there are signs that caregiving is returning to the public conversation, significant policy changes are still needed to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Iran's political system is a complex mix of elected leaders and theocratic and military power players, with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, holding ultimate authority. The President, currently Masoud Pezeshkian, manages day-to-day governance but is subordinate to the Supreme Leader. The Guardian Council ensures legislation aligns with Islamic principles, while the Expediency Discernment Council mediates disputes. The Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), led by General Mohammad Pakpour, wields significant military and economic influence, and the Parliament (Majlis) drafts laws subject to the Guardian Council's approval.</p>

The ONS also noted that demand for DIY goods had fallen, and figures on the UK economy showed government borrowing hitting the second-highest level for May since 1993.
