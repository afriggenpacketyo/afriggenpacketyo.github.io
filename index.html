          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant surge after the European satellite operator revealed a 1.35 billion euro capital raise supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, along with debt refinancing, aims to bolster Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following this move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, with India's Bharti Space Limited holding 18.7%. French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that strengthening Eutelsat's position ensures France's strategic independence and paves the way for Europe's autonomy. The company's shares have been highly volatile this year, with an initial spike followed by a sharp drop. </p>

          <p>Germany's population growth slowed to 0.1% in 2024, a decrease from the 0.4% growth seen the previous year, according to the Federal Statistical Office. Despite an overall increase to 83.6 million residents, the figures indicate that deaths outnumbered births, with immigration driving the population growth. Western states experienced a 0.2% increase, while eastern states, excluding Berlin, saw a 0.3% decline, Bavaria experiencing the largest state increase. The number of foreign nationals residing in Germany increased by 2.3% to 12.4 million, with Turkish, Ukrainian, and Syrian nationals forming the largest diaspora groups. The aging of the baby boomer generation also contributed to a rise in the number of people aged 60 and older.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skater Kaori Sakamoto, a three-time world champion, announced her retirement from competition following the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. The 25-year-old, who won a bronze medal in women's singles at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, revealed her plans at the opening ceremony for a new skating rink in her hometown of Kobe. Sakamoto expressed her desire to conclude her career the year she turns 26, citing the following Olympics in 2030 as being "out of the question" due to her age. She aims to win at least silver in both individual and team events at the Olympics, and intends to live each day to the fullest in pursuit of her goals.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, primarily driven by a "dismal" month for supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics. Sales volumes fell by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly decline since December 2023, with food retailers reporting reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco due to consumer cutbacks. Separate figures indicated that government borrowing reached the second-highest level for May since 1993, totaling ¬£17.7 billion. While sales volumes in the three months leading up to May increased by 0.8% compared to the previous three months, economists suggest that the burst of economic growth seen earlier in the year has ended. </p>

An investment group led by Mark Walter, owner of the LA Dodgers, is poised to acquire the Lakers, reflecting a trend towards consortiums and institutional investors dominating sports ownership. The Lakers' financial strength and market appeal make it a sound investment, despite challenges facing the cable industry. While this shift could benefit teams like the Lakers, it raises concerns about accountability and potential exploitation in smaller, less successful franchises.</p>

          <p>Singapore‚Äôs Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is scheduled to visit China next week, marking his first trip since assuming office in May 2024. The visit is expected to provide Beijing with an opportunity to promote itself as a reliable partner for Southeast Asian countries and a defender of multilateralism. China will likely seek to reassure Singapore that its economy is "back on track" amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Trade and economic cooperation are anticipated to be central topics during the discussions.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government reported that 87 Japanese nationals and their family members have been evacuated from Iran and Israel due to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The evacuees arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan, and Amman, Jordan, by bus as local airports remained closed. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that none of the evacuees had health issues and that the government is arranging additional bus transportation for more people from Iran. Japan also plans to dispatch two Self-Defense Forces planes to Djibouti to evacuate nationals if airports in Iran and Israel reopen.</p>

          <h2>Study Challenges Theory on Why Birds Sing at Dawn</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology challenges the long-held theory that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly at that time. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little evidence to support the "acoustic transmission hypothesis." The study suggests that the dawn chorus may be more related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about finding food. The findings indicate that environmental factors may not be the primary drivers of the dawn chorus.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl has died, and seven other children have been hospitalized in northern France due to a severe food poisoning outbreak. Symptoms began to emerge on June 12 in and around Saint-Quentin, with children aged 1-12 being admitted to the hospital over the following days. The cause of the outbreak is still under investigation, as the children are not believed to have interacted in the same groups. The girl died from haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), a rare condition linked to acute kidney failure, commonly caused by E.coli bacteria.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience offers a valuable lesson in mitigating the impact of China's dominance in critical minerals. Following China's 2010 export ban on rare earths, Japan diversified its supply sources, investing heavily in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. As a result, Japan has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90%, with plans to further decrease it to below 50% this year. This strategy demonstrates the importance of stockpiling, recycling, promoting alternative technologies, and investing in diverse supply chains to ensure supply chain security.

In Scotland, a separate assisted dying bill is also under consideration.
