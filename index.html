          <p>An explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in at least one fatality and several injuries. Law enforcement and federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, are investigating the incident, with a suspect believed to be deceased. Residents were instructed to avoid the area as authorities searched for potential additional devices. The American Reproductive Centers of Palm Springs confirmed the explosion occurred outside their facility but stated that staff, eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials remained unharmed, while the clinic will resume operations on Monday.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unearthed the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, also known as the "sea moth", in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, part of the extinct group radiodonts, possessed a unique pencil sharpener-like mouth and intimidating claws, challenging previous understandings of radiodont complexity. The discovery revealed a multi-segmented abdomen-like region with gills, similar to modern arthropods, and provided insights into the open circulatory system of this ancient predator. The sea moth's existence sheds light on the diversity of life during the Cambrian period and the rapid evolution of animal groups.</p>

The recording, published by Axios, supports the special counsel's conclusion that Biden would be perceived as a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." The audio contrasts with Democrats' previous assertions of Biden's sharpness and competence, raising questions about transparency and the party's handling of concerns about his fitness for office.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria came as a surprise to senior officials at the Treasury Department, who were scrambling to understand what he meant and which measures would be rolled back. Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979. The new government has blamed sanctions for its inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health-care system decimated by war.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise, creating confusion about the specifics and timeline of the rollback. While the decision was welcomed by Syria's transitional government, which has lobbied for sanctions relief, the lack of clarity has prompted discussions within Treasury to determine the scope and pace of the changes. The move comes as the Trump administration aims to bring peace and stability to the Middle East, but the abrupt announcement has raised questions about the decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have engaged in a new round of talks to end the war in Gaza, after Israel's military launched a major new offensive. The proposal had been put forward by US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff in recent weeks, but both sides had previously indicated obstacles to the plan. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised a major military escalation that would occupy and control swathes of Gaza, force the Palestinian population to the south of the territory and "destroy" Hamas.</p>
