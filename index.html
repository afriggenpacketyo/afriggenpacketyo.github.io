          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted of the 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback, has died from terminal cancer at age 67. He was serving a life sentence and never disclosed the location of Falconio's body, which remains missing. Murdoch was also found guilty of the attempted kidnapping and assault of Falconio’s girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape. Australian police had recently offered a significant new reward for information leading to the discovery of the remains to provide closure for the family.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six counts, including murder, for the fatal shooting of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the non-fatal shooting of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. The U.S. Attorney's Office has indicated this is the first step in seeking the death penalty for what they term an act of "political violence and extremism." The indictment follows a 36-hour manhunt, and authorities also revealed details of a letter Boelter wrote making bizarre claims about being a military operative.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and its NATO allies are escalating military support for Ukraine by preparing to ship additional Patriot missile systems and other crucial munitions. This policy shift aims to bolster Ukraine's defense against persistent Russian drone and missile attacks. The move follows President Trump's meeting with NATO's Secretary General, where he emphasized that allies would provide their own systems and purchase more from the U.S. This renewed commitment to arming Kyiv signals a tougher stance against Russia, which has continued its bombardment of Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, renowned as the world's oldest marathon runner, has died at the age of 114 after being struck by a vehicle in a hit-and-run in his native village in India. Singh, who began running at 89 to cope with family tragedy, became an international inspiration for his athletic achievements in old age, completing his last marathon at 100. Although his age was never officially verified by Guinness World Records due to a lack of a birth certificate, he was widely celebrated. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to him as an exceptional athlete and an icon of fitness.</p>

          <p>The family of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, is calling on the Trump administration to prosecute the Israeli settlers who beat him to death in the occupied West Bank. Musallet was visiting family and was killed while trying to protect their farm from an attack that also left a Palestinian man dead. His family held an emotional press conference in Florida, describing him as a loving young man and criticizing the U.S. government for its perceived indifference. The U.S. ambassador to Israel has since stated he has asked for an aggressive investigation into the "criminal and terrorist act."</p>

          <p>Michael Bernard Bell, 54, was executed in Florida for the 1993 murders of Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith outside a bar in what was an attempted revenge killing. This marks the 26th execution in the U.S. for the year, matching the total for all of the previous year and highlighting a recent uptick in state-sanctioned executions. Bell was also convicted of three other murders committed in separate incidents.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly called for the Department of Justice to release all documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, a stance that puts him at odds with former President Donald Trump. This rare friction with a key ally comes as Trump faces criticism from his conservative base for the Justice Department's conclusion that there was no "client list" to be made public. Johnson stated that everything should be put "out there" for the public to decide, urging the Attorney General to explain her previous comments on the matter. This development highlights growing pressure within the Republican party for greater transparency on the controversial case.</p>

The article suggests that growing tensions will not help the EU address its trade deficit or secure critical supplies from China.

          <p>Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin is calling on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to revoke access for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to a critical database that manages billions in payments to farmers. In a letter, Baldwin expressed concerns about privacy, food security, and the potential for unauthorized changes to loans and payments by unelected individuals with no agricultural background. This follows an NPR report that a DOGE-linked staffer was granted high-level access allowing him to alter financial data with little oversight. Baldwin argues that farmers' private information must be protected from potential misuse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The poor box office performance of Pixar's latest film, "Elio," has reignited concerns about the studio's standing as a guaranteed hit-maker. The film had a record-low opening weekend for the company and is on track to be its lowest-grossing non-pandemic release. This article analyzes how "Elio's" failure, which followed a tumultuous production and extensive script revisions, suggests a potential shift at Pixar away from novel, personal stories toward safer, franchise-based sequels. While the studio has major sequels in the pipeline, the struggles of an original film like "Elio" may signal a more risk-averse future for the celebrated animation house.</p>

The author notes that while Davie has survived the immediate storm, his leadership has been questioned by government officials and the recent events have visibly taken a toll. In response, the BBC appears to be signaling a tougher stance on workplace conduct, with several staff members being dismissed or stepping back from roles. The clear message is that the leadership is attempting to reassert control and enforce accountability.</p>

According to an ICE memo, the policy reverses previous practice and subjects these individuals to mandatory detention, which can last for years as their cases proceed. The move, which is expected to face immediate legal challenges, comes after Congress provided ICE with increased funding for detention. Critics have called the legal position "laughable" and a violation of due process, while supporters argue detention is the most effective way to ensure removal.</p>

          <p>This article examines the fallout from a massive data breach where a UK official inadvertently leaked personal details of thousands of Afghans who had worked with British forces. The leak, which occurred three years ago, prompted a secret, high-stakes operation to evacuate some of those at risk from the Taliban, a response that was hidden from the public by a super-injunction. The author raises key questions about the government's moral responsibility, the effectiveness of data security, and whether the injunction was also used for political cover.
