          <p>Amid the escalating Israeli offensive in Gaza, Palestinians are enduring hellish conditions characterized by relentless bombardment, scarcity of food, and constant fear for their lives. Alaa Moein, a resident of Gaza City, expressed his despair, stating that he expects to die with his children every day due to the ongoing conflict. Farmer Naim Shafi'i and his family have been repeatedly displaced, seeking shelter in tents and struggling to find sustenance. Despite limited aid being allowed into Gaza, the United Nations emphasizes that it is insufficient to address the widespread famine risk affecting the region's 2.1 million residents.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric car battery maker, experienced a surge in its Hong Kong trading debut, but U.S. onshore investors were notably absent due to escalating tensions between China and the United States. CATL, deemed a strategically important technology company by China, was placed on a Pentagon blacklist, leading to the exclusion of American investors from its share sale. This move underscores the deepening financial decoupling between the two nations, as Washington aims to limit China's access to American markets over national security concerns. CATL plans to use the raised funds to expand its operations in Europe, including building a new factory in Hungary.</p>

          <p>British police have charged a second man, Stanislav Carpiuc, with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, following fires at two properties and a car connected to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The charges relate to three incidents: a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street, and a fire at an address he previously lived at in north-west London. Carpiuc is accused of conspiring with Roman Lavrynovych, who was previously charged with arson and denied the charges.

Trump expressed optimism about a potential peace deal, stating that negotiations would "immediately" begin, while Putin's statement showed no signs of concessions, emphasizing the need to eliminate the root causes of the crisis.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose over 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), making it the largest offering this year globally, with funds allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply European automotive clients. Despite increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, including potential tariffs and watchlist designations, CATL's core strategy remains focused on markets such as Europe and emerging regions, limiting the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on its global ambitions.</p>

Japan's copyright act allows the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models, attracting AI investors to the country. The anime industry faces a labor crunch due to unattractive working conditions, and AI is seen as a solution to fill the gap. While many artists worry about losing their jobs, some studios emphasize that AI plays a supporting role and will not replace human creativity.</p>

          <p>The recent conflict between India and Pakistan has showcased the capabilities of Chinese-made fighter jets and air-to-air missiles, renewing warnings to Taiwan. Pakistan's use of Chinese J-10C fighters and PL-15 missiles has fueled nationalist pride in China, with commentators claiming the jets' success demonstrates the advancement of China's defense industry. While the Chinese government has been reserved in its comments, analysts suggest the conflict highlights that Chinese weapons are now on par with Western ones. Some in Taiwan have expressed concerns that their planes would have "little chance of survival" against Chinese ones.</p>

          <p>A haka performed in protest by three Māori party legislators in New Zealand's Parliament has ignited a fierce debate about whether it was peaceful dissent or disruptive and intimidating behavior. The protest, against a bill seen as dismantling Indigenous rights, led to proposed lengthy bans for the lawmakers. A vote to approve the bans was suspended, threatening to gridlock the legislative agenda until a consensus is reached. The incident has polarized lawmakers, with some decrying the protest as disrespectful and others defending it as an expression of Māori identity.</p>

It clarifies that McLaren has generally been the faster car this season, with more pole positions and race wins than Red Bull.
