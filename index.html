          <p>The Detroit Opera House is set to premiere “The Central Park Five,” an opera depicting Donald Trump's role in the wrongful conviction of five Black and Latino teenagers for the sexual assault of a Central Park jogger. The opera portrays Trump as an inflammatory figure who fueled public outrage against the young men in 1989. As Trump regains political power, some worry about potential retaliation against the Detroit Opera for staging the production. The opera chronicles the coerced confessions and subsequent exoneration of the young men, highlighting themes of racial injustice and political manipulation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies have provoked a trade war, dismantled treaties, and challenged established global economic norms.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly seeking out unaccompanied immigrant children, conducting "welfare checks" that critics fear are a guise for deportation and criminal prosecution. An internal ICE document reveals that officials are gathering intelligence to assess if the children are a flight risk, a threat to public safety, or viable for deportation. Legal services for these children have been slashed, and sensitive data is being shared with ICE. Advocates worry about the trauma inflicted on the children and their families, and the potential for "backdoor family separation."</p>

          <p>A disability-rights case at the Supreme Court saw heated arguments over the legal standards for suing public schools that fail to accommodate students with disabilities. The case involves a teenage girl with epilepsy whose family argues that some courts have made it too difficult to sue schools. The school district's lawyer argued that all claims over accommodations for people with disabilities should be held to a higher legal standard. The justices appeared skeptical of this argument, suggesting a sweeping ruling is unlikely, with a decision expected by the end of June.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of lawyers and staff members are leaving the Justice Department’s civil rights division, citing a shift in priorities under the Trump administration. Veterans of the office say they have been driven out by Trump administration officials who want to drop its traditional work to aggressively pursue cases against the Ivy League, other schools and liberal cities. The administration has reopened its “deferred resignation program,” allowing employees to resign but continue to be paid for a period of time. The new head of the division welcomed the turnover and made plain the division’s priorities.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are urging the White House to disclose financial transactions leading up to President Trump's tariff pause, citing concerns about potential insider trading. They are requesting that senior White House and executive branch employees expedite the release of reports related to their securities transactions since the start of Trump's term. The Democrats pointed out that such reports were made public during the first Trump administration, and they are concerned that no periodic transaction reports have been posted since January 20, 2025.

The fees, which began appearing over the weekend, often exceed the price of the products themselves.

The move comes after Temu and Shein warned they would raise prices following the tariff increase and the end of the de minimis exemption. The increased prices may erode Temu's appeal to consumers who were drawn to its low prices.</p>
