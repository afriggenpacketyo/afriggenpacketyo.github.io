        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five eastern NATO membersâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The move signals their intent to potentially produce and deploy land mines to secure their borders, forming what some call a new "Iron Curtain." This decision has sparked controversy due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end, with humanitarian groups warning against the strategy while defense officials cite it as a necessary deterrent against aggression.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return from elbow surgery by pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he threw the fastest pitch of his major league career, reaching 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani was hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his aggressive approach on the mound, viewing it as a positive step in his recovery.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in many public outdoor areas, including all beaches, parks, and the vicinity of schools and libraries. The new regulations, which took effect Sunday, are part of a national strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aim to protect children from passive smoke. Violators could face fines up to â‚¬700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not extend to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, a point of difference with upcoming rules in neighboring Spain.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals a harrowing stalking campaign by a Church of England lay preacher, Venessa Pinto, against a volunteer, Jay Hulme, after he rejected her advances. The article details how Hulme's initial complaints were dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, who accused the victim of witchcraft and sided with the perpetrator. Despite an internal HR investigation finding Pinto responsible, the abuse escalated until police intervention led to her conviction. The story highlights systemic failures within the church to protect a victim and the profound personal and professional damage Hulme suffered as a result.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police are assessing footage from Glastonbury Festival after controversial on-stage comments were made by two musical groups, Bob Vylan and Kneecap. During their set, which was broadcast live by the BBC, Bob Vylan led chants calling for "death to the IDF," prompting strong condemnation from the government and the BBC. The broadcaster labeled the remarks "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service.

Events in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto are characterized by a mix of jubilant street parties and a more defiant, protest-oriented tone compared to recent years. Organizers and participants are highlighting the need to resist recent political and legislative rollbacks targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender individuals. This year's parades also face headwinds from reduced corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader trend of companies scaling back on diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p>

Mandatory evacuation orders are in effect for areas south of Highway 138, while warnings are in place for regions to the north.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric directed at judges from both sides of the aisle. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts stated that such language can lead to serious threats and violence against judges who are simply performing their duties. Without naming specific individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to condemn remarks from both President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. His comments underscore a growing concern for judicial safety and independence amid intense political polarization.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new training strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. The team recently lived together in a "virtual athletes' village" during a domestic competition, simulating the unfamiliar and challenging conditions of an Olympic Games. The goal is to help athletes, particularly younger ones, build resilience and teamwork by facing logistical hurdles and living in close quarters away from home. Officials and athletes reported the experience was valuable for building motivation and team morale.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has renewed his attacks on President Trump's major tax and spending cut package, arguing the legislation would destroy jobs and harm future industries. In a series of posts on X, Musk called the bill "utter madness" and "political suicide for the Republican Party," escalating a recent conflict with the administration he recently departed. The criticism adds another challenge for Republican leaders as they try to unify their party to pass the nearly 1,000-page bill. The public feud is notable given Musk's previous role as a major GOP donor and close ally of the president. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters rallied in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule, leading to clashes with riot police. The demonstration, one of the largest in recent months, saw police deploy tear gas and stun grenades, resulting in dozens of arrests. The student-led protests are part of months-long demonstrations fueled by accusations of government corruption and ties to organized crime. President Vucic has condemned the protests as a foreign plot and has so far refused calls for a snap election.</p>

          <p>China's decision to halt exports of rare earth materials is accelerating international efforts to establish alternative production chains, though analysts warn the process will be difficult and expensive. An American firm, REalloys, noted that building a non-Chinese supply chain will require significant investment and government support, such as subsidies and tariffs, to compete with China's market dominance. The company is planning a new facility to produce high-performance magnet materials using ore from Brazil processed in Canada. This reflects a broader geopolitical push to reduce dependency on China for these critical resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "urban heat island" effect is a phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, exacerbating the impact of heatwaves. This temperature difference, which can be as much as 10Â°C, is primarily caused by the dark, hard surfaces of buildings and roads that absorb and retain the sun's heat. This stored heat is then slowly released, keeping urban areas warmer, especially at night. The lack of vegetation and water, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, further contributes to the effect, making city dwellers more vulnerable to climate change.</p>

The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund charity, teaches pupils how to read UV indexes and apply sunscreen correctly, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. With melanoma cases projected to rise, experts stress the importance of prevention, as sunburn in childhood significantly increases risk later in life. The program is planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026 as part of the standard health curriculum.</p>

The H2A series, which boasts a 98 percent success rate, is now being retired in favor of the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket.

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The massive turnout was partly fueled by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. The city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, and the event proceeded peacefully, transforming from an LGBT celebration into a broader protest for human rights and solidarity. Participants used the march to mock Orban and express frustration with his authoritarian policies.</p>
