          <p>Emily Thornberry has officially pulled out of the race for the Labour deputy leadership position, narrowing the field to four remaining candidates. Announcing her decision on social media, Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, had only secured 13 nominations from MPs, falling significantly short of the 80 required to advance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently leads the race with 116 nominations, positioning her as the clear frontrunner. The contest is seen by some as a potential distraction for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, as it could become a platform for party members to voice discontent with the current leadership.</p>

          <p>American pharmaceutical company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, is canceling its planned £1 billion expansion in the United Kingdom, citing insufficient government investment in the life sciences sector. The company will relocate its research operations to the United States and reduce its UK workforce, a decision that industry experts warn could signal a trend of major pharmaceutical firms divesting from the UK. The move comes amid broader industry concerns about the UK's declining competitiveness and pressure from the Trump administration for companies to invest more heavily in the US. A government spokesperson acknowledged that more work is needed while defending its existing investments in science and research.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index soared to a new all-time high, driven by optimism following positive U.S. inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Tech investment giant SoftBank Group was a major contributor, with its stock jumping over 10% following a report of a massive cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI. This connection is significant due to SoftBank and Oracle's joint involvement in the U.S. government's $500 billion Stargate AI initiative. The rally in Japanese markets reflects a broader positive sentiment seen across several Asian and U.S. stock indices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the starkly different reactions from Donald Trump's supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal versus the E Jean Carroll sexual abuse case. The article suggests that while Trump has been found liable in the Carroll case, his base has shown indifference, yet has expressed outrage over his association with Epstein. The author posits that this discrepancy stems from a misogynistic worldview that selectively sentimentalizes the abuse of young girls while dismissing allegations from adult women who don't fit a traditional victim archetype. This dynamic allows supporters to feel a sense of moral clarity in condemning Epstein while ignoring other credible accusations against the president.</p>

          <p>A Belgian arts festival has canceled a scheduled performance by the Munich Philharmonic because its designated conductor, Lahav Shani, is Israeli. The Flanders Festival Ghent organizers stated they were concerned about Shani's stance on the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, despite his past statements supporting peace. The decision has drawn sharp criticism, with German Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer calling it a "disgrace for Europe" and an act of cultural boycott.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil, a move that has been met with skepticism in Europe. The proposal is intended to further pressure Russia's economy, but EU officials are wary of alienating key trading partners and being drawn into Trump's aggressive trade policies. Analysts suggest the EU is unlikely to agree, given its own complex energy and trade relationships with Russia and its general aversion to using tariffs as a primary policy tool. The request also complicates ongoing U.S. trade negotiations with India, raising questions about the administration's strategic consistency.</p>

          <p>Spain's lower house of parliament has voted to shelve a bill that would have reduced the standard work week from 40 to 37.5 hours, delivering a significant setback to the minority Socialist-led government. The legislation, championed by Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz, was defeated when the regional Catalan party Junts sided with conservative and far-right opposition parties. Opponents argued the measure would impose unsustainable costs on small businesses and farms, potentially leading to job losses. This defeat highlights Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's ongoing struggle to pass key reforms through a fragmented and contentious parliament.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the relationship between Europe and the United States is facing a structural, not temporary, rupture that will persist regardless of whether Donald Trump is president. The author suggests that underlying security, demographic, and economic forces are driving the two continents apart, making a return to the old alliance based on shared values unlikely. The piece outlines two potential futures: a transactional relationship of convenience or a more dangerous world of competing empires where Europe is caught between the U.S., Russia, and China. The author criticizes European leaders for self-humiliation in their attempts to appease Trump, arguing it signals weakness and makes a worse outcome more likely.</p>

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan over the past five years in a strategic mineral exploration program, resulting in significant new discoveries of oil, gas, and critical minerals like lithium and uranium. Officials reported that since 2021, geologists have identified over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, including 10 major oilfields and 19 large gas fields. These breakthroughs are part of China's broader effort to enhance its energy security, dominate critical mineral supply chains, and reduce its dependence on foreign imports. The discoveries are expected to support stable domestic production of oil and natural gas for years to come.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was assassinated in Utah, was a pivotal figure in the MAGA movement and a close confidant of the Trump family. As the founder of Turning Point USA, he built a powerful youth organization that reshaped conservative outreach and played a crucial role in mobilizing young voters for Donald Trump. Kirk was known for his confrontational campus debates and his influential podcast, which made him an authority on politics, faith, and culture for millions of followers. His death has sent shockwaves through the White House and the broader conservative movement, where he was viewed as a vital link to a new generation of supporters.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face meeting in over a year and a half. The 50-minute meeting is being viewed as a small but potentially significant step toward mending their fractured relationship, following years of public criticism and family tension. In recent months, Prince Harry has publicly expressed a desire for reconciliation, and the quiet coordination of this meeting suggests a mutual, albeit cautious, effort from both sides. While a full family reunion remains distant, particularly with no signs of a meeting with Prince William, this encounter is seen as a positive development.</p>

          <p>Eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk report that the conservative activist was ironically in the middle of a debate about gun violence when he was shot. The 31-year-old was hosting his signature "Prove Me Wrong" event at Utah Valley University, inviting students to challenge his views. One witness stated that just as a question about gun control was being addressed, a single shot rang out and Kirk was seen grabbing his neck as blood poured out. The gunman remains at large, and the incident has prompted widespread condemnation of political violence from leaders across the political spectrum, with President Trump ordering flags to be flown at half-staff.</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials who were fired last month have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming their terminations were an illegal act of political retribution. The complaint alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel told one of the agents that his own job depended on firing individuals involved in past investigations of President Trump, stating the president "hasn't forgotten" the FBI's previous actions. The lawsuit, brought by decorated veterans of the agency, argues that the purge was directed by the White House to punish law enforcement for doing their jobs. This action highlights ongoing tensions and claims of politicization within federal law enforcement agencies under the current administration.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) reveals that democracy continued to decline globally in 2024. The study, which analyzed 173 countries, found that over half showed a decline in at least one key democratic indicator, such as credible elections or access to justice, between 2019 and 2024. The report highlights a particularly sharp deterioration in press freedom, which saw its biggest drop in 50 years. While European nations still dominate the top of the democracy rankings, the overall trend points to a concerning erosion of democratic norms and institutions worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from real estate company Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a level of "normalcy" relative to local incomes, reaching a mortgage-to-income ratio last seen in July 2018. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with rapidly rising wages in the tech sector. However, this return to a pre-pandemic equilibrium does not mean the city has become affordable in absolute terms, as San Francisco households still spend a much larger share of their income on housing than the national average. The analysis highlights a growing divergence between high-earning homeowners and renters, who face spiking costs driven by the local AI boom.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, labeling it a profound tragedy for his family and a disaster for a country already steeped in political hatred. The author argues that while Kirk was a charismatic but divisive provocateur, his murder during a public debate is an assault on the principles of free speech and democracy. The article condemns the act of violence itself while also criticizing the immediate rush by some on the right to blame the left's rhetoric and call for political repression.

This is not the first time Bad Bunny has expressed political views regarding immigration enforcement, having previously criticized ICE raids targeting Dominican migrants in Puerto Rico.

Scientists emphasize that non-biological processes could also be responsible and that conclusive proof requires returning the samples to Earth for in-depth analysis.
