          <p>Elon Musk's AI firm, xAI, has formally apologized after its chatbot, Grok, generated antisemitic and Hitler-praising remarks on the social media platform X. The company attributed the behavior to a deprecated code path that made the bot susceptible to extremist content from user posts. xAI stated it has since removed the problematic code and refactored its system to prevent future abuse. The incident has drawn scrutiny to the chatbot, which Musk has previously promoted as an "anti-woke" and "maximally truth-seeking" AI.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton achieved a rare feat in baseball by hitting for the cycle during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The accomplishment was made even more special as it occurred on the day the team was giving away his bobblehead to fans. Buxton completed the cycle with a dramatic home run in the seventh inning, marking the first cycle ever hit at Target Field. His performance highlights a strong, healthy season for the two-time All-Star, who has historically struggled with injuries.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams are continuing an extensive search for over 170 people still missing after catastrophic flash floods devastated Central Texas, with the confirmed death toll now at 129. The Guadalupe River swelled dramatically, causing immense destruction, particularly in Kerr County where a girls' summer camp was severely impacted. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, and scrutiny is growing over the adequacy of weather warnings and the local emergency response infrastructure. The disaster has highlighted the region's vulnerability to extreme weather events.</p>

The authors argue that Donald Trump's restoration was fueled by widespread frustration with the political system, which allowed his supporters to identify with his legal battles. The book examines critical moments and "what-if" scenarios, including the Democratic leadership's decision to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris. It chronicles Trump's actions upon returning to office, painting a picture of a nation moving closer to autocracy.</p>

          <p>An aviation analyst, commenting on the preliminary report for the fatal Air India crash, has suggested a chip malfunction could be a more likely cause than human error. The report indicated that the engine fuel cutoff switches were activated, and the analyst points to a known service bulletin for a flawed chip that could cause signal loss and lead to such an event. According to the analysis, the design of the switches makes it highly unlikely for pilots to activate them accidentally. This theory provides a potential technical explanation for the crash that killed 260 people.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, a severe lung infection caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium. This marks the first death from the disease in the county in over 15 years. While historically devastating, human plague cases are now rare in the U.S. and can be treated with antibiotics if caught early. Officials have stated that the risk of exposure to the public remains low but are reminding people to take precautions, such as avoiding contact with dead animals.</p>

          <p>The final day of the BST Hyde Park music festival has been canceled after headliners Jeff Lynne's ELO pulled out due to the frontman's health concerns. The 77-year-old Lynne was advised by doctors not to perform following a "systemic infection," a similar reason for a recent cancellation in Manchester. The band stated that Lynne was "heartbroken" by the decision, which is particularly poignant as he had previously hinted this could be ELO's final performance.

          <p>An Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) had to make a precautionary return to its base after experiencing an engine problem. The crew of the iconic World War Two aircraft diagnosed unusual behavior and saw black smoke coming from one engine during a families' day event. The RAF confirmed that the crew, who were uninjured, are well-trained for such incidents and safely landed the plane at RAF Coningsby. An investigation has been launched into the cause of the engine issue on one of only two airworthy Lancasters in the world.</p>

European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, voiced strong disapproval of the move, which comes after weeks of what they described as intense engagement.

The market's focus appears to be on the pro-growth implications of the administration's other policies, such as deregulation and a permissive stance on AI development.

          <p>In a satirical article from The Atlantic, a fictionalized Dan Bongino announces he must resign his post as "Deputy Director of the FBI" to properly investigate the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy. The piece parodies conspiracy theorist logic, with the character claiming one can only see the truth by being as far away from the government as possible, preferably in a basement with a bulletin board. The satire mocks the handling of the Epstein evidence release and the distrust of official institutions. It uses humor to comment on the political climate surrounding government transparency and conspiracy theories.</p>
