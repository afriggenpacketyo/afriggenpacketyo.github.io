          <p>The United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, following an earlier Israeli attack. President Trump announced the strikes, stating that "monumental damage" was inflicted. The attacks come amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with Germany caught in diplomatic crossfire. The German Chancellor defended the US actions, and other countries are urging Iran to avoid further destabilizing actions. The German government was only informed after the attacks had already commenced, mirroring the situation with the initial Israeli strikes. The situation has raised questions about international law and the potential for further escalation. The long-term consequences of these actions remain uncertain. Optimism is low given the escalation of military conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>Following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, Germany finds itself in a difficult diplomatic position, with Chancellor Merz defending the US actions despite not being informed in advance. Germany, along with France and the UK, issued a statement urging Iran to avoid further destabilizing actions, focusing on preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. German officials emphasized that Iran had crossed a "red line" and must return to negotiations. However, some German politicians have expressed concerns about the legality of the US attack under international law. The situation underscores the complexities of international relations in the face of escalating conflict. Germany's role is to promote stability and security in the region.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, the prosecution presented evidence, including text messages, travel records, and hotel receipts, to support allegations of arranged sexual encounters with male escorts. The evidence detailed alleged logistics and financial transactions related to these encounters, referred to as "freak-offs," "hotel nights," or "wild king nights." Text messages and invoices from hotels, including the Trump International Hotel, were shown to the jury. Messages also referenced IV fluids and other substances allegedly used to recover from the encounters. Combs maintains that all encounters were consensual, however the prosecution alleges that these encounters were the result of sex trafficking.

          <p>The joint US-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities reflect a flawed approach to Iran based on pressure and destabilization, according to this analysis. The author argues that Netanyahu manipulated Trump into escalating the conflict to serve his own agenda. Despite causing damage, the strikes have provoked a swift response from Iran, exposing vulnerabilities in Israel's defenses. The strikes have failed to ignite mass revolt in Iran and have instead strengthened national identity. The author suggests that diplomacy is the only viable path forward and calls for a reassessment of US policy in the Middle East, prioritizing regional equilibrium over unconditional support for Israel.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Qatar advised American citizens to shelter in place, and Qatar temporarily closed its airspace due to a credible threat, amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The closure followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and warnings of retaliation from Iran. The U.K. also advised its citizens in Qatar to shelter in place, however, Qatari officials stated that the advisories did not reflect specific threats. Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest U.S. base in the Middle East, hosts approximately 8,000 U.S. troops. The situation highlights the heightened security concerns in the region.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts, making them a more attractive option for savers. While CD interest rates are not as high as in previous years, they remain substantially higher than traditional savings account rates. CD rates are fixed, providing guaranteed returns even if interest rates decline during the CD term. The article provides a comparison of potential earnings between CDs and traditional savings accounts, demonstrating the superior returns offered by CDs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July if inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman's comments align with those of fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a potential shift in the Fed's monetary policy. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates to alleviate the national debt burden, but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to hold rates steady at its last meeting. Bowman believes the impact of tariffs on inflation may be less significant than initially anticipated, opening the door for rate adjustments. The FOMC is scheduled to meet in late July, but the likelihood of a rate cut at that time is uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>When facing both medical and credit card debt, determining which to pay off first requires careful consideration. Credit card debt can damage credit scores more quickly due to monthly reporting and high interest rates, while medical debt often has a longer grace period. Credit card debt also compounds faster, making it crucial to prioritize to avoid escalating balances. Both types of debt can end up in collections, but credit card issuers are generally more aggressive. The article suggests prioritizing credit card debt to protect credit scores and avoid compounding interest, while exploring options like financial assistance and payment plans for medical debt. Managing both types of debt proactively is essential for financial well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has stated that Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported and then charged with human smuggling, will remain in custody despite a judge's order for his release. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) insists that Ábrego García is a "dangerous criminal illegal alien" and will not be freed on American soil. Although a judge found insufficient evidence to prove Ábrego García posed a flight risk or endangered minors, immigration officials are expected to detain him upon his release by the Justice Department. The government accuses Ábrego García of participating in a trafficking conspiracy, transporting undocumented migrants between Texas and Maryland. This case highlights the administration's firm stance on immigration enforcement.</p>

She describes the conditions inside as scandalous, with detainees facing issues such as lack of clothing, filthy showers, and limited access to communication. Chu emphasizes the need for oversight and accountability, particularly in privately run, for-profit detention centers.

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, marking a significant milestone in astronomical observation. The observatory, designed as a survey telescope, aims to create a comprehensive, 4-D map of the cosmos, cataloging billions of astronomical objects over a 10-year period. Its data pipeline connects the observatory to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in California, enabling the analysis and distribution of images to astronomers worldwide. The observatory is expected to amplify the capabilities of existing observatories and potentially detect near-Earth objects and evidence of alien intelligence. The project represents a remarkable feat of human coordination and engineering, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with Earth's resources.</p>

The telescope will capture an image roughly every 40 seconds for ten years, every three days, for a Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The observatory's big goals, she adds, is to "understand the history of the Universe" which means being able to see faint galaxies or supernova explosions that happened "billions of years ago".

A White House spokesperson clarified that producers must keep oil prices down or risk benefiting adversaries.

          <p>The United States bombed Iran, with Trump announcing that B2 bombers attacked three nuclear sites including the Fordow nuclear site. According to American and Israeli leaders, Iran was about to construct a nuclear weapon, however, no serious analyst of Iran’s nuclear program believes this to be true. The answer is political opportunity, as the Islamic Republic of Iran has never been weaker, and it also suffers from a crisis of internal legitimacy. Regionally, Iran has never been weaker, and the loss of its main regional ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah was a huge blow to Iran’s regional influence and its national defense doctrine. The real Iranian threat to Israel is rooted in Iran’s ideological opposition to Israeli and American policy in the region.</p>

Iran's judiciary claims the situation at Evin prison is "under control," while Israel asserts it targeted "regime targets and agencies of government repression." France condemned the strike on the prison due to the endangerment of its citizens held there. The Israeli military said it had struck military command centers, including the IRGC's "Thar-Allah" facility, which is designated to defend Tehran from security threats, and another used by the IRGC battalion responsible for homeland defence. The strikes follow a recent escalation in conflict between Israel and Iran, raising concerns about further destabilization in the region.</p>

The move comes amid a resurgence of interest in nuclear power, driven by increasing electricity demand from data centers and the electrification of industries. The state is seeking partners for the project, which is a part of a Master Plan for Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, Iran has vowed retaliation, prompting analysis of potential targets. Possible responses include attacks on U.S. military assets in the Middle East, closure of the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric warfare, such as terror and cyber attacks. U.S. military assets in the Middle East include bases in Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and other countries, housing tens of thousands of personnel. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil supply, could be targeted by Iran. The U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System has warned of a heightened threat environment, including potential cyber attacks.

          <p>Ford Motor Co. is recalling nearly 200,000 electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs due to potentially faulty door latches. The door latches may remain locked after a driver or front seat passenger exits the vehicle and shuts the door, potentially trapping a child or other passenger who is unable to use the interior door releases. The recall affects model years 2021-2025. Ford will notify owners of the safety risk, and dealerships will fix the problem by updating the vehicles' software. The remedy is expected to be available by late September. This recall addresses a potential safety concern for rear seat passengers.</p>

This trend suggests that the trade and tech tensions between the US and China may be influencing trade patterns with Europe. Chinese exports of batteries, laptops, smartphones, and solar panels to the EU have reached unprecedented levels in some countries. Lithium-ion battery exports across the EU surged by 52 per cent from a year earlier. This shift has resulted in a notable increase in the EU's trade deficit with China.</p>
