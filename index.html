          <p>Kensington Palace released a new photograph of Princess Charlotte, taken by her mother, Catherine, Princess of Wales, to celebrate her 10th birthday. The image, captured during a family trip to Cumbria earlier this year using an iPhone, shows a smiling Charlotte. As Prince William and Kate's second child, she is third in line to the throne, and due to succession rule changes in 2013, she is the first British princess to rank above a younger brother, marking a significant moment in royal history and tradition.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have entered into an economic agreement granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense and providing the U.S. with a strategic alternative to China's rare earth mineral dominance. The deal, described as an equal partnership, involves U.S. investments in Ukrainian mineral, oil, and gas projects, with Ukraine contributing half of future royalties. This agreement could mitigate America's reliance on China for critical minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing and military equipment, as China has recently imposed export restrictions in response to U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>With higher education facing attacks from the Trump administration, including threats to federal funding and demands for control over admissions and curriculum, universities are being urged to band together to defend academic freedom. While Harvard has resisted Trump's demands, other institutions may struggle to do so alone. A statement signed by over 200 college presidents condemns federal interference, but a broader campaign is needed to demonstrate the value of universities. The article suggests that wealthier institutions should aid financially weaker ones, forming a 'NATO for higher education' to resist the administration's pressure.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. oil and gas projects are expected to increase under President Trump's administration, reversing previous declines seen under President Biden. Despite Trump's trade policies causing economic disruption, his focus on expanding fossil fuel production has spurred a surge in emissions. This shift threatens to exacerbate climate change impacts, as the U.S. aims for record oil production levels. The International Energy Agency warns that no new fossil fuel projects should proceed to meet agreed temperature limits, making Trump's ambitions a point of concern for global climate goals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is under fire for its efforts to sell off federal public lands, which are collectively owned by all American citizens. This initiative includes opening more land to drilling, mining, and logging, as well as selling land for housing development. Critics argue this undermines landscape protections and democratic governance. The administration cites emergencies such as an 'energy emergency' and a 'housing affordability crisis' to justify these actions. Public land advocates express concern over the disregard for public support for safeguarding these lands and the potential for environmental damage and loss of recreational opportunities.</p>

          <p>Chevron's stock price decreased on Friday due to a decline in profits attributed to falling oil prices. The company's net income fell by over 30% to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, from $5.5 billion in the previous year, although adjusted earnings of $2.18 per share aligned with Wall Street estimates. The decline in U.S. crude oil prices, influenced by President Trump's tariffs and increased OPEC+ production, impacted Chevron's U.S. production business. Despite the lower earnings, Chevron returned $6.9 billion to shareholders and expects to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of shares in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trumpâ€™s trade policies have contributed to lower oil prices while simultaneously increasing costs for oil and gas companies, leading to reduced first-quarter profits for the two largest U.S. oil companies.

As a result, some companies are scaling back operations, with rig counts in the Permian Basin declining.

Analysts suggest this escalation is a tactic to gain advantage before a truce halts fighting. The United Nations documented over 2,641 civilian casualties in the first three months of the year, and the attacks have displaced about 40,000 Ukrainians from their homes.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending federal funding for NPR and PBS, citing political bias. The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease federal funds for both media entities, potentially impacting local stations, especially in rural areas. Meanwhile, a federal judge ruled that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants from South Texas was unlawful, stating it exceeded the statute's scope. The judge's ruling protects those detained in the Southern District of Texas and is likely to be appealed by the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>Trump Ends Chinese Tariff Loophole Amidst Trade Negotiations</h2>

          <p>President Trump has ended a rule that allowed cheap Chinese goods to bypass U.S. tariffs, closing a loophole that U.S. businesses claimed gave China an unfair advantage. This move, however, is expected to raise prices for American consumers on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu. Trump is also giving other countries a chance to avoid tariffs by making trade deals, with his administration negotiating with over a dozen nations before a July 8 deadline. Simultaneously, a cabinet shake-up saw Michael Waltz moved to the U.N., and Marco Rubio assumed the role of interim national security adviser.</p>

The ECB stated that only those whose biological sex is female will be able to participate in women's and girls' cricket. Transgender women and girls can continue playing in open and mixed cricket categories. This policy change follows a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman based on biological sex. The ECB emphasized its commitment to inclusivity and ensuring cricket is played in a spirit of respect.</p>

The 3-ton truck had fallen into the hole in Yashio City in January, and rescue efforts were hampered by the unsteady ground and concerns about the stability of the surrounding area. Experts have attributed the sinkhole to corrosion in sewer pipes, highlighting concerns about aging infrastructure in Japan. The case has prompted calls for infrastructure improvements and inspections to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services killed nearly 2 million wild animals last year, using methods including firearms, poisons, and traps. While some killings are justified for protecting endangered species or preventing bird strikes at airports, the majority are related to conflicts with animal agriculture. Coyotes, European starlings, feral hogs, and pigeons, which interfere with livestock or feed crops, accounted for over 75% of the deaths. This reflects a consequence of animal agriculture, which has cleared wildlife habitat and leads to government-sponsored killing to protect industry interests.</p>
