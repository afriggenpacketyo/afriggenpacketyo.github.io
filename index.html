          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials concluded a day of tariff negotiations in Switzerland, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset" in a social media post. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in discussions aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, though specific details remain undisclosed. While Trump expressed openness to lowering tariffs, Chinese officials insist on the U.S. dropping its tariffs first. The talks are taking place against a backdrop of slowing goods flow and significant economic impact from the existing tariffs, with both sides acknowledging the unsustainable nature of the current situation.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to resume trade negotiations, aiming to de-escalate tensions impacting the global economy. The meetings, the first since increased tariffs, seek to address trade imbalances and concerns over fentanyl exports from China. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that both sides are engaging in talks has raised hopes for a potential reduction in tariffs and a tempering of hostile rhetoric. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing that a prolonged trade war could lead to slower growth and higher prices worldwide.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for "direct talks" with Ukraine, suggesting they should begin as early as May 15, seeking to remove the root causes of the conflict and move towards a lasting peace.

          <p>Five fishermen, including three Peruvians and two Colombians, arrived in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by an Ecuadorian tuna boat following 55 days adrift at sea. The fishermen had been missing since mid-March after reporting damage to their boat's alternator shortly after departing from Peru. The Ecuadorian navy is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. This rescue follows a similar incident earlier this year when another Peruvian fisherman was saved after 95 days at sea.</p>

          <p>Southern California's recent heat wave is expected to end Saturday evening, with cooler temperatures forecast for Mother's Day. After record highs, temperatures are predicted to drop by about 5 degrees on Sunday, with coastal areas experiencing highs in the 60s to mid-70s. The return of fog and breezes is anticipated, with the possibility of drizzles and light rain early next week. The rapid shift marks a return to more typical May weather conditions after a brief period of extreme heat.</p>
