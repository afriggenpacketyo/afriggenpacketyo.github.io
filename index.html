          <p>Federal authorities have arrested an Ohio man for allegedly making credible threats to murder U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The Cincinnati resident, Anthony Kelly, reportedly posted threats on social media, including plans to purchase a shotgun to use against officials. This arrest occurs amid heightened concerns from the Department of Homeland Security about a significant increase in assaults and doxxing incidents targeting ICE personnel. A search of the suspect's home uncovered a firearm and ammunition, underscoring the seriousness of the threats.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat carrying 48 Vietnamese passengers and five crew members capsized in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay during a sudden thunderstorm, resulting in at least 34 fatalities. Rescue operations successfully saved 11 individuals, but eight people remain missing as the search continues. The vessel, named Wonder Sea, reportedly overturned due to powerful winds, with many of the passengers being tourists from Hanoi, including approximately 20 children. The tragedy is compounded by the approach of a tropical storm, which is expected to hit the region soon.</p>

          <p>The latest season of Iowa Public Radio's podcast "Unsettled" delves into the multifaceted issue of gender dynamics in contemporary American society, with a specific focus on the role men play. The series examines how gender influences daily life and contributes to the persistent gender gap. By shifting the lens to include male perspectives and responsibilities, the podcast aims to foster a more comprehensive understanding of the societal structures and personal behaviors that perpetuate these inequalities. This approach seeks to uncover new avenues for dialogue and progress on the topic.</p>

          <p>Veteran guard Marcus Smart is set to join the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. The former Defensive Player of the Year plans to sign a two-year, $11 million deal, which includes a player option for the second year. Smart is expected to provide much-needed perimeter defense for the Lakers, complementing their offense-oriented backcourt. His addition is seen as a key move to bolster the team's depth and defensive capabilities as they aim to contend in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p>

University enrollments for Mandarin studies in the U.S. and Britain have seen significant drops from their peaks within the last decade. This decline reflects a broader shift in linguistic and cultural priorities, potentially influenced by changing geopolitical relationships and perceptions of China's global role.

Mexican airlines will now need U.S. government approval for their flight schedules.

          <p>Joe Casello, a Democratic state representative from Boynton Beach, Florida, has passed away at the age of 73 following a heart attack. First elected to the Florida House in 2018, Casello was a former firefighter who had also served as a city commissioner before his tenure in state legislature. According to state law, Governor Ron DeSantis must now call a special election to fill the vacancy left by his death. Casello had previously announced plans to run for a seat on the Palm Beach County Commission in 2026.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to strengthen cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic alignment is driven by the necessity to address the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. security commitments to Europe. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on security and defense. This move, alongside joint appearances with French and British leaders, signals a new emphasis on European-led security initiatives, potentially including reliance on French and British nuclear deterrents.</p>

          <p>An investigation by DW reveals that the Ukrainian military has been drafting men with pre-existing and sometimes severe mental health conditions, raising concerns about their fitness for service. Due to gaps in medical data systems and the pressure of mobilization, individuals with documented personality disorders and other psychiatric issues are being sent to basic training. Lawyers and human rights advocates highlight that while military doctors often distrust documentation for fear of draft evasion, the practice poses a danger to the recruits and their units. The situation underscores the immense strain the war is placing on Ukraine's mobilization system.</p>

          <p>Spanish football club Barcelona has reportedly reached a deal in principle to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club. The move, likely an initial loan with an option to buy, comes as Barcelona seeks to strengthen its attacking options on the left wing. Despite Rashford's inconsistent form, Barcelona is attracted by his potential and the financially advantageous loan structure, which mitigates risk. The transfer highlights a strange situation where a player deemed an outcast at a struggling Premier League club is being pursued by the La Liga champions.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their tour of Australia with a 27-19 victory in the first Test match in Brisbane, though the performance was uneven. The Lions dominated the first 50 minutes, building a commanding lead with a sharp and physical display, but their momentum faded after making numerous substitutions. Australia scored two late tries to make the final scoreline more respectable, but the Lions' lead was never seriously threatened. While a win is a positive start to the series, the flat second-half performance left a feeling that the team has more to give.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Bank of America analysts makes a bold comparison, suggesting quantum computing could be the most significant human breakthrough since the discovery of fire. The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, theoretically allows for near-instantaneous complex calculations, promising to revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence. While major milestones have been achieved, such as Google's Sycamore processor vastly outperforming supercomputers, a quantum computer has yet to solve a practical, real-world problem better than a classical one due to the instability of qubits.

          <p>Recently emerged air-to-air photographs of two Shenyang J-35 fighters suggest the aircraft may have entered low-rate initial production for the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The jets are shown with construction numbers and new shark markings on their tails, similar to other operational naval aircraft, indicating they could be in service. The J-35 is a carrier-based stealth fighter, and its progression toward operational status is a significant step in advancing China's naval aviation capabilities. The new fighters are expected to operate from China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Adolf Hitler, known as "Operation Valkyrie," is being observed. The assassination attempt, led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg, failed when a bomb he planted only minorly injured the dictator, leading to the swift collapse of the coup. While the plotters were initially deemed traitors, they are now largely remembered as heroes of the German resistance, though their motives and elitist background remain subjects of historical debate. The event stands as a powerful symbol of resistance within the Nazi regime, despite its ultimate failure.</p>

In a social media post, he labeled the advocates for transparency as "troublemakers and radical left lunatics," suggesting that no amount of disclosure would satisfy them. This commentary comes amid sustained public pressure and a lawsuit Trump himself filed against the Wall Street Journal over an Epstein-related story.

          <p>Following an order from former President Trump and intense public pressure, the Department of Justice has formally asked a federal judge to unseal grand jury testimony from the Jeffrey Epstein case. In its motion, the DOJ cited "extensive public interest" and stated it would work to redact victim information and other personal details to protect privacy. This move has been called for by lawmakers from both parties who argue transparency is crucial to restoring public trust. However, some legal experts caution that grand jury transcripts may offer only a limited, high-level view of the overall investigation.</p>
