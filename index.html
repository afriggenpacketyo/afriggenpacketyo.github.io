          <p>Following U.S.-led talks and an announcement by President Trump, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire to end weeks of escalating military confrontation. However, both countries quickly accused each other of violating the agreement, with reports of explosions and cross-border shelling in the disputed Kashmir region. The U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commended both Prime Ministers on choosing the path of peace, while Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar thanked Saudi Arabia and Turkey for facilitating the deal. Despite the initial agreement, the situation remains tense, with each side blaming the other for initiating the violations.</p>

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum in Point Roberts, Washington, is moving to Canada due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on goods from China and strained relations between the U.S. and Canada. The museum, which relies heavily on Canadian tourists, has experienced a significant drop in sales due to the tariffs and a Canadian boycott of U.S. businesses. Owners Neil and Krystal King cite the instability and economic pressure as reasons for relocating, despite their love for their current location. They plan to reopen the museum in Canada to avoid the tariffs and continue serving their loyal customers.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Ukraine to participate in direct talks on May 15 in Istanbul, hours after European leaders urged Moscow to agree to a 30-day ceasefire. Putin stated Russia seeks serious negotiations aimed at a lasting peace but did not directly address the ceasefire request. European leaders warned of new sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the ceasefire. Kyiv has not yet responded to the invitation, and the Kremlin has warned that trying to pressure Russia is useless.</p>
