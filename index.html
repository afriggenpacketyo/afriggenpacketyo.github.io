            <p>During a White House meeting with President Trump, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S., despite a Supreme Court order. Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported from Maryland. Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, indicated the decision rests with El Salvador, offering to provide a plane if they choose to return him. The situation has sparked debate over immigration policy and the rights of deported individuals, especially those wrongfully removed. The Trump administration's hardline stance on immigration continues to face scrutiny. Optimism score: 30</p>

This trend has become particularly popular with Gen Z women and has transformed female friendship into a commercial enterprise. Unlike self-improvement-focused “podcast bros,” these shows embrace gossip and unfiltered conversations, providing a sense of empowerment for women. Optimism score: 70</p>
