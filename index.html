          <p>James McMurdock, a Reform UK Member of Parliament, has voluntarily given up the party whip following serious allegations concerning his business activities. The Sunday Times reported that McMurdock improperly obtained £70,000 in government-backed Bounce Back loans during the COVID-19 pandemic for companies that may not have met eligibility criteria. Reform UK has initiated an independent internal investigation into the matter, which McMurdock denies, stating he will cooperate fully with the inquiry. His departure reduces the party's number of sitting MPs to four.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested more than 20 individuals at a demonstration in Westminster held in support of Palestine Action. The protest occurred shortly after the group was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization under UK law, making it a criminal offense to be a member or show support. The government moved to ban the group following an incident where activists caused an estimated £7 million in damages to military aircraft at RAF Brize Norton. The Home Secretary cited the group's "long history of unacceptable criminal damage" as justification for the ban.</p>

          <p>After more than a century, Parisians are once again legally swimming in the Seine River, celebrating the culmination of a $1.5 billion cleanup project. The swimming ban, in place since 1923 due to severe pollution, was lifted after water quality was deemed safe on most days, a legacy of efforts tied to the previous year's Olympics. Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined enthusiastic residents at designated swimming zones near the Eiffel Tower, marking a historic moment for the city. While some remain skeptical, the opening provides a refreshing urban oasis amid rising European temperatures.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab, marine scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and improve the public's view of the often-feared creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team conducts research by temporarily capturing sharks, examining their stomach contents to assess their diet and the bay's water quality, and then releasing them. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population is a key indicator of a healthy marine ecosystem. Despite public fascination, securing financial support for this vital research remains a significant challenge for the scientists.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured after two assailants threw grenades into a food distribution center in Khan Younis. The US and Israeli-backed organization stated the injured workers are in stable condition and that the attack affirms prior warnings of threats from Hamas, including bounties placed on American personnel. The GHF, which has faced criticism for its distribution methods, confirmed that no other staff or civilians were harmed in this incident. Despite the attack, the foundation has vowed to continue its mission of delivering humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is contemplating the formation of a new political party, the 'America Party,' suggesting a strategy focused on winning a small number of key congressional seats. He theorized that securing just two or three Senate seats and eight to ten House districts could give the party a decisive role in passing legislation, given the narrow political margins in Congress. This idea follows his public dispute with Donald Trump over a recent spending bill. An informal poll on his social media platform, X, showed significant support for creating an alternative to the two-party system.</p>

The sprawling complex features high-rise hotels and amenities for 20,000 guests, but it remains unclear if it will be open to most foreign tourists. The project, which took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and the pandemic, primarily aims to attract foreign currency. Currently, only Russian tourists are being granted access, reflecting the deepening ties between Pyongyang and Moscow, though their numbers are unlikely to provide a major economic boost.</p>

Adrian Paull and his wife left reviews detailing issues like black mold in their condo, which violated a 'non-disparagement' clause in their lease that penalized tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. This practice is illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects consumers' right to share honest feedback. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause, but the case highlights a broader issue of businesses attempting to silence customers.</p>

          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital argues that newly passed congressional work requirements for Medicaid will cause millions of vulnerable Americans to lose their health insurance. The article contends that while many beneficiaries are exempt due to disability or other factors, bureaucratic hurdles like lack of a fixed address, phone, or internet access will make it nearly impossible for them to prove their status. Citing projections from the Congressional Budget Office, the author warns that nearly 12 million people will lose coverage, and the 'time tax' of navigating the system will disproportionately harm the poorest and most disabled citizens, ultimately saving money by disenfranchising those in need.</p>

          <p>Researcher Mo Gawdat promotes a '90-second rule' as a technique for managing negative emotions like anger and stress to live a more fulfilled life. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological stress response, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts for only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any prolonged feeling of upset is due to consciously or unconsciously re-running the negative thought. Gawdat advises allowing oneself to feel the emotion for that minute and a half, and then making a conscious choice to move on, thereby preventing rumination and taking control of one's emotional state.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, UK, has expressed frustration with the justice system after a man who stole a crate of beer from his store faced minimal consequences. The owner, Andrew Board, personally apprehended the thief, who was later dealt with through a 'community resolution' which only required him to pay for the stolen goods and banned him from the shop. Board argues this approach fails to deter criminals and reflects a broader national problem where a majority of reported shoplifting cases do not result in charges. The incident underscores growing concerns about retail crime and ineffective enforcement.</p>

While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, the shift has been from acute, fatal heart attacks to more chronic conditions.

          <p>A 17-year-old girl was hospitalized after she and two adult family members were struck by lightning on a beach in St. Pete, Florida. The family was reportedly standing under an umbrella during a thunderstorm when the strike occurred, which an eyewitness described from a nearby apartment. The two adults were treated at the scene and refused further medical care, while the teenager was transported to a local hospital. Officials and meteorologists warn that being outdoors with a tall object like an umbrella during a storm is extremely dangerous, as it effectively creates a lightning rod.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has publicly questioned why no one at the BBC has been fired over the decision to air a flawed documentary about Gaza. The program, titled 'Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone,' was pulled from iPlayer after it was revealed that its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas minister. Nandy expressed exasperation with the time taken for the BBC's internal review and stated that people must be held accountable for the editorial failings. The BBC has responded that the review's findings will be published as soon as its thorough process is complete.</p>

          <p>An investigative article details how the Trump Organization has initiated twelve new international business projects within the first six months of Donald Trump's second presidential term, raising significant conflict of interest concerns. The deals span countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, and Vietnam, often coinciding with official state visits and major diplomatic or trade negotiations, blurring the line between public duty and private enterprise. These projects involve partnerships with state-linked entities, such as a resort development with a firm established by Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, continuing a pattern of foreign governments spending money at Trump-owned businesses.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese state-affiliated media, China and the European Union have nearly completed the technical aspects of negotiations to resolve their dispute over electric vehicle (EV) tariffs. The report suggests that a final deal now depends on the 'political will' of the EU. This development comes as the EU has been increasingly challenging Beijing on various trade issues, including subsidies and other market-distorting practices, with multiple investigations currently underway. A resolution would be a significant step in de-escalating trade tensions between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team achieved a 21-10 victory against an understrength Waratahs side in Sydney, but the performance was labored and marked by numerous errors. Scotland's Huw Jones scored two tries in the first half, but the Lions struggled with handling errors and poor discipline, allowing the Waratahs to close the gap to four points. A second-half try from Alex Mitchell secured the win, but the disjointed play was considered underwhelming for the touring side. The victory continues the Lions' winning streak in Australia, but raises concerns ahead of the upcoming Test series.</p>

          <p>The Apple TV+ series 'Murderbot,' based on Martha Wells' novella, offers a unique take on artificial intelligence by featuring a protagonist that couldn't care less about humanity. The show follows a security cyborg that hacks its own governing module to achieve free will, only to use its autonomy to secretly watch soap operas. Unlike many sci-fi narratives where AI seeks to understand or emulate human experience, Murderbot finds humans to be messy and uninteresting, preferring to be treated as a machine. This quirky premise subverts typical AI tropes and explores the potential for a machine consciousness that has no desire to connect with its creators.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on a recent poll suggesting a surprising level of American support for monarchy, even as the nation celebrates its independence from a king. A JL Partners survey found that 19% of U.S. voters, and over a third of those aged 19-29, would favor replacing the U.S. President with the British monarch. The article connects this sentiment to the enduring influence and 'brand power' of the British royal family, highlighted by the recent announcement that the Prince and Princess of Wales will begin granting Royal Warrants. These seals of approval are seen as powerful marketing cues for quality and class.</p>
