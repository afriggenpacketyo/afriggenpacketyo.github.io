          <p>Russia launched a significant overnight attack on Ukraine, utilizing a combination of drones and missiles that targeted seven different locations. The southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia was severely affected, with authorities reporting at least one death and 24 injuries, including three children, alongside extensive damage to residential buildings. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for stronger international sanctions against Moscow. Concurrently, Ukrainian forces successfully targeted two Russian oil refineries in retaliatory strikes, demonstrating their continued capability to hit strategic assets within Russia.</p>

          <p>A couple has shared their harrowing experience of discovering that a funeral director, Amie Upton, was keeping the body of their stillborn daughter at her private residence instead of at the designated funeral parlor. The parents, Cody and Liam Townend, found their baby on a sofa, feeling she had been robbed of her dignity during a time of immense grief. This case has highlighted the lack of regulation in the UK's funeral industry, prompting the couple and their local MP to call for new laws to ensure such a distressing event does not happen to other families.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, even after a significant Court of Appeal ruling. The court overturned an injunction obtained by Epping Forest District Council, which had sought to stop The Bell Hotel from being used for this purpose. Despite this setback, which was seen as a key test case, councils including West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne intend to press on with their own legal challenges, citing planning law breaches and unsustainable strain on local services.</p>

The initial loan will cost Bayern Munich £13 million, with a purchase option valued at £56.2 million for the 24-year-old Senegal international. Jackson's transfer comes after his playing time at Chelsea became limited following the arrival of new attacking players. Having already agreed to a pre-contract, he has been granted permission to travel to Germany to finalize the move.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has dealt a legal blow to President Donald Trump's trade policies, upholding a lower court's ruling that he cannot unilaterally alter the nation's tariff schedules. The decision, which came after the court expressed skepticism about the scope of presidential authority in this area, challenges a cornerstone of Trump's economic strategy. This ruling sets the stage for a potential high-stakes confrontation at the Supreme Court over the constitutional limits of executive power in matters of international trade and tariffs.</p>

          <p>A global movement to enhance online safety for children is fueling the development of artificial intelligence-powered technologies designed to protect them from harmful content. New laws, such as the UK's Online Safety Act, mandate that tech companies prevent children from accessing age-inappropriate material, leading to the adoption of age-verification systems from firms like Yoti. This regulatory push has created a new market for digital ID and content-filtering tools, while also prompting discussions about user privacy and data security in this evolving technological landscape.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's struggles under manager Ruben Amorim are linked to the difficulties in implementing his rigid 5-2-3 positional system, which has often been ineffective in the Premier League. This tactical analysis explores how Amorim's gameplan, reliant on creating numerical overloads in wide areas, is frequently neutralized by opponents using man-to-man marking. Furthermore, the team's two-player midfield is often outnumbered, leading to a loss of control and contributing to the club's disappointing results despite significant financial investment in new players for the squad.</p>

In a direct countermove, California lawmakers voted to redraw their state's maps to create an equal number of new Democratic-leaning seats, aiming to nullify Texas's advantage.
