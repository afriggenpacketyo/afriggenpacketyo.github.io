          <p>Serious concerns are growing for the Los Angeles Rams as quarterback Matthew Stafford continues to be sidelined by a back issue with the NFL season opener approaching. The 37-year-old veteran has not taken a single snap in team practices, leaving his availability for the September 7th game against the Houston Texans in doubt. While coach Sean McVay has previously expressed confidence in a recovery plan, the lack of progress is heightening worries about the team's prospects without their Super Bowl-winning quarterback.</p>

Their departure successfully derailed an initial special legislative session called to redraw congressional maps in a way that would favor the GOP. With a new special session now underway, Democrats are trickling back, though it remains uncertain if a quorum will be present, and they still face threats of arrest from state Republican officials for their actions.</p>

          <p>Air Canada was forced to suspend its plans to resume flights after its 10,000 flight attendants, represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, defied a government-issued back-to-work order. The strike, which has already affected about 130,000 travelers daily, continues as the union challenges the order's constitutionality and demands a fairly negotiated contract. The dispute centers on pay and compensation for unpaid work, with the union rejecting the airline's latest offer as insufficient to counter inflation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accompanied by top EU and NATO officials, is traveling to Washington to meet with President Trump following the recent U.S.-Russia summit. This high-stakes visit aims to ensure Ukraine and its European allies are central to any peace negotiations and to prevent agreements being made without their input. The presence of a strong European contingent is seen as a safeguard to reinforce Ukraine's position and advocate for a unified transatlantic approach, particularly regarding security guarantees and territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>Award-winning Irish novelist Sally Rooney has declared she will continue to support the direct-action group Palestine Action, even after it was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. Rooney stated she will use her earnings and public platform to support the group's actions against what she terms 'genocide,' accepting that this may make her a 'supporter of terror under UK law.' The UK Home Secretary defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and other disruptive activities.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the United States and European nations to provide Ukraine with "Article 5-like" security guarantees. This development, which emerged from the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, is considered a significant concession, as it addresses Ukraine's security concerns without requiring formal NATO membership. Ukrainian and European leaders have welcomed the potential guarantees but are seeking more details on their practical implementation ahead of meetings in Washington.</p>

          <h2>Nationwide Strike in Israel Demands Ceasefire and Release of Hostages from Gaza</h2>

          <p>Protesters across Israel conducted a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza. The 'day of stoppage' reflects growing public frustration after 22 months of war, with demonstrators fearing that continued military pressure endangers the lives of the approximately 50 hostages still held. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the protests, claiming they benefit Hamas, while he navigates pressure from far-right coalition members who oppose any deal that leaves Hamas in power.</p>

          <h2>China's Anti-Corruption Drive Increasingly Targets Officials from Ethnic Minorities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:00:10 EDT</div>

          <p>Recent high-profile corruption investigations into senior officials from ethnic minority communities in China signal a shift in the country's approach to ethnic affairs. The downfall of cadres from Tibetan and Hui backgrounds suggests that the previous leniency sometimes afforded to non-Han officials no longer applies under the current push for strict political discipline. Historically, top administrative posts in autonomous regions were reserved for ethnic minority members to promote inclusion, but these cases indicate that all officials are now subject to the same level of scrutiny in the anti-graft campaign.</p>
