          <p>A 27-year-old bride was fatally shot, and a 13-year-old was among the wounded, when masked gunmen opened fire on a wedding party in Goult, southeastern France. The violence, potentially linked to drug-related score-settling, occurred as the newlyweds were leaving the party. One of the attackers also died during the assault, with initial reports suggesting they were run over by the couple's car. Authorities have launched a murder investigation and mobilized dozens of police officers and a helicopter to apprehend the remaining assailants, leaving the small village in shock and fear of a tarnished reputation.</p>

          <p>Severe storms swept across the upper Midwest, resulting in three fatalities in Enderlin, North Dakota, due to a tornado. The storm system, characterized by tornadic activity, large hail, and strong wind gusts, also caused extensive damage in northern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. Beltrami County, Minnesota, declared a state of emergency after wind gusts exceeding 100 mph caused flash flooding, downed trees, and building damage in Bemidji. Over 10,000 customers in northern Minnesota remain without power, and Itasca State Park is closed due to a "traumatic wind event," as residents brace for more severe storms amid dangerous heat across the region.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, criticized the U.S. attacks against Iran's nuclear facilities, calling them a "massive gamble" by President Trump and expressing concern that Congress did not approve the strikes.

He emphasized that the Constitution grants Congress the sole authority to declare war, raising questions about the legality of the strikes.

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait, a critical global trade route located between Oman and Iran, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that such a move by Iran would be "suicidal," potentially provoking a global backlash, especially from countries like China that heavily rely on the Strait for oil imports. The U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending its recent precision strike on Iranian nuclear sites, asserting it was a limited engagement to disrupt Iran's nuclear capabilities. However, some lawmakers are questioning the legality of the action, as it was carried out without Congressional approval. Officials maintain the strike was not an attack on Iran or its people but a targeted effort to degrade nuclear weaponization ambitions, and that the president has the authority to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Critics argue that Congress should have been consulted before any military action was taken.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities is described as a significant gamble with the potential to reshape the Middle East and the concept of military intervention. Success could disempower Iran and enhance Trump's authority, but failure could lead to a protracted conflict and further destabilize the region. The intervention has drawn criticism from European leaders and Gulf states, who fear being drawn into a wider war. Analysts suggest that careful de-escalation is crucial, but the situation remains fraught with risk, with Iran potentially abandoning the non-proliferation treaty and seeking nuclear weapons in secret.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global oil trade route. This appeal follows Iran's warning that it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty after U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear facilities. The potential closure of the Strait, through which 20% of global oil consumption passes, could severely impact the global economy. Rubio stated that it would be "economic suicide" for Iran and would warrant a strong response from the international community, including the U.S., which has a naval presence in the region.</p>

Hegseth stated the U.S. wants Iran to negotiate peace, threatening further aggression if it doesn't, but the U.S. is in contact with Tehran privately and publicly.

          <p>A suicide bombing at a church on the outskirts of Damascus, Syria, resulted in the deaths of at least 20 people and injuries to 52 others. The attacker, who was affiliated with the Islamic State group, entered Mar Elias Church in Dweila during a service and opened fire before detonating an explosive vest. The Syrian Civil Defence posted photos and video from inside the church showing a heavily damaged altar, pews covered in broken glass and a bloodied floor. The Syrian government condemned the attack.</p>

          <p>Kenan Yildiz scored two goals to lead Juventus to a 4-1 victory over Wydad in their Group G match in Philadelphia during the Club World Cup. Juventus took an early lead with an own goal forced by Yildiz, followed by a spectacular strike from Yildiz himself. Wydad reduced the deficit, but Yildiz scored again in the 69th minute, and Dušan Vlahović added a penalty to secure the win. The result eliminates Wydad, and Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fails to beat Manchester City.</p>

The author claims that masking is not good policing practice and may violate Department of Homeland Security regulations. The author further argues that the practice undermines the authority of the agents, puts public safety at risk, and can be seen as intimidation. The author suggests that Congress should prohibit the use of masks by immigration agents.</p>

          <p>Following military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. officials, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, are urging Iran to engage diplomatically rather than retaliate. Officials emphasized that the strikes were aimed at Iran's nuclear program, not its people, and called for a peaceful resolution. Hegseth stated that the scope of the U.S. attack was "intentionally limited" and not aimed at "regime change." Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, however, argued that the U.S. had "blown up diplomacy" by launching the strikes.</p>

          <p>A rare June heatwave is gripping parts of the US, with tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East bracing for dangerously hot temperatures. Most of the northeastern quadrant of the country is under some type of heat advisory, with forecasts calling for heat indices exceeding 100F in many areas. Cities like Philadelphia have declared heat emergencies, directing residents to cooling centers and setting up medical hotlines. Meteorologists attribute the extreme temperatures to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that traps heat and humidity.</p>

Brook's innings, marked by outrageous strokes and dropped catches, ended when he top-edged a hook. Despite a rapid stand between Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, England were eventually bowled out for 465, trailing by six runs. Stokes' late wicket and Carse's earlier dismissal of Yashasvi Jaiswal shifted the momentum, leaving the match finely balanced.</p>

          <p>Satellite images of Iranian nuclear sites show new craters and possible collapsed tunnel entrances, but do not offer conclusive evidence that the underground facilities were breached. The images also reveal that a large support building on the Fordow site remained undamaged. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors are still trying to assess the extent of the damage. Experts suggest that the strikes may complicate tracking Iranian uranium and ensuring Iran doesn't build a weapon, potentially incentivizing them to move their program underground.</p>

Others, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, argued the strikes were a grave violation of the Constitution and grounds for impeachment, while some Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene opposed the U.S. action.</p>
