          <p>Kesha responded to fan backlash by replacing the AI-generated cover art for her single "Delusional" with a photograph of herself, taken by Brendan Walter. The singer initially used an AI image to express her frustration with the undervaluation of artists, but later decided that living in alignment with her integrity was more important. Kesha credited her team of human artists for the new cover, emphasizing the importance of considering human ramifications as AI technology advances. "Delusional" is the second single from her upcoming album "Period," marking her first release under her independent label, Kesha Records, after settling her legal battle with Dr. Luke.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) cautions that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in the upcoming Spending Review, as it finalizes budget plans for key sectors like the NHS, defense, and education. The think tank suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact other unprotected areas, potentially leading to real-terms cuts. With Chancellor Rachel Reeves ruling out additional borrowing and tax increases, speculation mounts over potential spending cuts to meet fiscal commitments. The IFS highlights the government's "front-loaded" spending approach, warning that the consequences of slowing down funding must be confronted, especially given ambitions to improve the criminal justice system and address prison overcrowding.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sale of single-use disposable vapes is now prohibited across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and reduce environmental waste. Shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, but the ban targets disposable vapes, which are considered a key factor in the rise of youth vaping. While vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, the long-term risks are still unknown, and disposable vapes, with their colorful packaging, have contributed to increased vaping among young people. Retailers violating the ban face fines, with the government predicting a significant impact, though health experts call for further regulation to address youth vaping. The optimism score reflects the fact that the ban is meant to protect children's health, and reduce waste.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, has cautioned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, may be susceptible to hacking due to slight delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could provide eavesdroppers with opportunities to exploit the system during quantum key distribution (QKD), a method designed to ensure secure communication. Despite the theoretical unhackability of QKD, Miller's analysis of data from Micius revealed vulnerabilities in its experimental implementation. The findings raise concerns about the security of China's quantum communication network and the potential for side-channel attacks.

          <p>Hamas has responded to the US-backed Gaza ceasefire proposal with demands for amendments, including a permanent truce and complete Israeli withdrawal, conditions not included in the current plan. While prepared to release some hostages, Hamas insists on guarantees for sustained aid and an end to the war, leading to a stalemate in negotiations. US envoy Steve Witkoff has deemed the response "totally unacceptable," while Israel remains firm on its right to resume hostilities, leaving the situation highly uncertain. The article reflects the complex and difficult position Hamas faces, caught between internal pressures and military realities. The optimism score is low due to the continued conflict.</p>

          <p>The White House has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, President Trump's pick to lead NASA, days before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote.
