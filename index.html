          <p>Elon Musk's attempt to revamp government efficiency through the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) has ended, but his companies are set to face reduced oversight. Musk's disruptive approach created both fear and anticipation before he gave up on his governmental role. Despite his departure, Musk maintains powerful friends in Washington, suggesting his influence will continue to shape policy and regulation. The long-term implications of Musk's involvement in government and his subsequent exit remain to be seen as his companies navigate a landscape with potentially less scrutiny.</p>

Laatsch allegedly transcribed classified information into a notepad at his desk and hid it in his socks, planning to deliver it to an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign emissary.

          <p>Texas Longhorns football coach Steve Sarkisian has refuted claims that the university spent $40 million to build its roster, calling the reports "irresponsible." Sarkisian acknowledged that the program has significant financial resources due to name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing. He suggested that $25 million was a more accurate figure for Texas' investment and emphasized that many other schools are also spending money to acquire players. Sarkisian's comments come after assertions that Texas' spending was comparable to or surpassed the $20 million spent by Ohio State.</p>

Challenges included training the AI with sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the system's security, and gaining international acceptance of the new verification methods. So far, only the initial training and testing phase has been completed, and specific data cannot be disclosed due to the classified nature of nuclear warheads.</p>

          <p>A senior Hamas official has stated that the group rejects the latest US proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, despite the White House claiming Israel has agreed to the plan. Hamas asserts that the proposal fails to meet their core demands, including a complete end to the war and a return to previous humanitarian protocols. The Israeli government has not commented, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told hostages' families that he accepted the proposal. Hamas maintains contact with mediators and will provide a written response in due course.</p>
