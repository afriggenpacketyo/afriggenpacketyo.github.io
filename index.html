          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem detailed plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations to Chicago, modeling them after recent deployments in Los Angeles. In an interview, she defended the administration's actions against criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, citing high crime rates in Chicago as justification for federal intervention. Noem also addressed the agency's hiring surge, the legal status of a high-profile detainee, and FEMA's readiness for hurricane season, asserting that the agency is more efficient and fiscally responsible than in the past. She stated that federal operations are not politically motivated and aim to enhance safety in all cities, regardless of their political leadership.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri claimed a controlled victory at an eventful Dutch Grand Prix, significantly extending his championship lead. The race was marked by multiple crashes and three safety car periods, creating a chaotic environment for the drivers. Piastri's McLaren teammate, Lando Norris, was on track for a second-place finish but was forced to retire with just seven laps remaining due to an oil leak, a major blow to his title aspirations. The unexpected turn of events allowed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to take second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar achieved his first-ever podium finish, securing third in a memorable race.</p>

He warned that these actions undermine vaccination efforts and could undo decades of public health progress. Echoing his concerns, former acting CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser also expressed fear that the leadership shakeup leaves the nation vulnerable to future health emergencies.</p>

He recounted a harrowing incident from his "Happy Days" era where he helped talk a suicidal teenager off a ledge over the phone. Winkler attributes his longevity and balanced perspective to tenacity, the ability to listen, and a deep sense of gratitude rather than just being a "nice guy."</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced that her party, if elected, will eliminate all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea. The policy shift aims to maximize fossil fuel extraction, with Badenoch arguing that current climate measures unfairly increase household energy bills. This move directly contrasts with the Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses and has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups and opposition parties. Critics argue the plan is reckless, will not lower energy bills, and represents a form of "irresponsible environmental vandalism" that undermines the UK's climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that the recent right-wing backlash against Cracker Barrel for updating its logo exposes the cynical and ulterior motives of the broader culture war. The piece argues that the outrage, amplified by figures like Donald Trump Jr., was manufactured to attack the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, rather than being a genuine response to a branding change. It connects the campaign against the restaurant chain to a larger strategy by activists like Christopher Rufo to "lay siege to the institutions" of American society. The author contends that making an example of Cracker Barrel is a tactic to instill fear in other corporations and impose an authoritarian agenda on all aspects of public life.</p>

          <p>CBS News is mourning the loss of veteran White House correspondent Mark Knoller, a revered figure known for his meticulous record-keeping of presidential activities across eight administrations. Knoller, who worked at CBS for 32 years, was considered the unofficial historian of the White House, with an encyclopedic knowledge of presidential statistics that even presidents' staffs would consult. Colleagues remembered him not only for his distinctive radio voice and journalistic integrity but also for his generosity and warmth.

          <p>Numerous beaches across the United States are under swimming advisories for Labor Day weekend due to high levels of fecal bacteria in the water. Popular coastal destinations from Florida to Maine and California have warned beachgoers against swimming, as the contamination can lead to illnesses like gastrointestinal distress and rashes. A recent report from Environment America found that 61% of U.S. beaches tested had at least one day of potentially unsafe fecal contamination levels in the past year. The pollution is primarily attributed to sources such as urban runoff, failing sewer systems, and industrial livestock operations, raising public health concerns during a peak travel period.</p>

          <p>Amid record levels of consumer debt, a growing number of American homeowners are tapping into their home equity through cash-out refinances to pay off high-interest loans. In the second quarter, 59% of all refinancing transactions were cash-outs, with many homeowners choosing to accept a higher mortgage rate to eliminate credit card and auto loan balances that carry much steeper interest. This trend highlights a paradox where many are house-rich, with record home equity, but cash-poor due to inflation and rising debt. While this strategy can significantly reduce monthly payments, financial experts caution borrowers to address the underlying spending habits that led to the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Dr. Gupta showcases the work of Dr. Prasad Shirvalkar, who used this method to map the unique neural signatures of chronic pain in patients' brains for the first time. This breakthrough has enabled the development of deep brain stimulation techniques that can predict and interrupt pain signals, offering new hope for managing a condition that affects millions.</p>

This development comes as the ongoing war has resulted in over 63,000 deaths in Gaza, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run territory, and a dire humanitarian crisis continues to unfold in the region.</p>

          <h2>Indonesian Government to Reduce Politician Perks Amid Widespread National Protests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a week of widespread anti-government protests, Indonesia's political parties have agreed to roll back some state-funded perks for lawmakers. President Prabowo Subianto announced that measures will include reducing the size of certain allowances and imposing a moratorium on overseas trips. The demonstrations, which have occurred in several cities and sometimes turned violent, were largely fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for parliamentarians that is nearly ten times the minimum wage. While the government hopes these concessions will quell the unrest, student leaders have called the move insufficient, demanding that deeper-rooted societal problems be addressed.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Six Key Phrases to Foster Cooperation in Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that building emotional safety is the key to getting children to listen. Instead of focusing on immediate obedience, parents should use phrases that create connection and validate a child's feelings, which calms their nervous system and encourages cooperation. Phrases like "I believe you," "Let's figure this out together," and "I'm on your side" shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative. By consistently protecting a child's dignity and assuring them of unconditional support, parents can build a foundation of trust where listening becomes a natural outcome rather than a result of threats or yelling.</p>

The article reveals that a majority of indoor heat fatalities in Maricopa County occurred in homes where the AC unit was broken or the electricity was shut off.

          <p>In a personal essay, a self-described liberal argues that hunting is a more honest and sustainable way to consume meat compared to the factory-farmed products common in modern society.

She contends that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, with license fees and taxes on firearms directly funding wildlife management.

          <p>President Trump's recent moves to influence the Federal Reserve, including the attempted removal of Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-standing political independence. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, critics and legal scholars warn that politicizing the Fed could undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system. Gaining control over the board would give the president influence not only on interest rates but also on bank regulation and the integrity of the Treasury system. This struggle raises concerns about the potential for politically motivated monetary policy, which could lead to economic instability similar to that seen in countries with less independent central banks.

The teenage royals, David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui, were attending a military school nearby when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees and rode the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of the traditional Hawaiian royal sport captivated locals and planted the seeds for the surf culture that would later flourish. The story serves as a crucial reminder of the sport's indigenous roots and its introduction to America through an act of cultural exchange.</p>

Although the containers are made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process effectively.
