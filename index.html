          <p>A power failure caused significant disruptions across the London Underground network, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line, leading to line suspensions and severe delays, as reported in the article. Transport for London (TfL) stated that the outage occurred around 14:30 BST, and while power has been restored, delays persist, affecting commuters and travelers across the city. Passengers shared their frustrations, highlighting the challenges of navigating the disrupted network and the lack of real-time updates from staff, while National Grid attributed the issue to a fault on its transmission network in central London. The incident underscored the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and the cascading impact on daily life in a major metropolitan area.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) declared its intention to disband and disarm, marking the end of a four-decade insurgency against Turkey, according to this Fox News article. The PKK stated that it has completed its historic mission, which shifted from seeking an independent Kurdish state to advocating for greater Kurdish rights and autonomy within Turkey. Turkey’s presidential communications director noted that the country will take necessary measures to ensure a smooth transition toward a terror-free environment, while the dissolution raises questions about the future of pro-American Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The U.S. and EU, allied with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and YPG, do not view these groups as affiliated with the PKK, contrasting with Turkey's stance.</p>

Alexander, a New Jersey native, moved to Israel at 18 and was serving in the IDF when captured, making him the last living American citizen held hostage by Hamas. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his role in securing Alexander's release, which is viewed as a goodwill gesture towards the Trump administration and a potential opening to jumpstart talks surrounding the broader conflict. While supporters celebrate his freedom, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum emphasizes the plight of the remaining hostages and urges Netanyahu to negotiate a comprehensive agreement.</p>

          <p>Indian and Pakistani military leaders held talks to extend a cease-fire that halted the most expansive fighting in decades between the two nuclear-armed states, according to this New York Times article. Civilian airports reopened, and stock markets jumped in both nations, signaling confidence in the agreement. Military leaders from both sides discussed measures to ensure neither side fires a single shot or initiates any aggressive action, while also agreeing to consider immediate troop reductions from the borders. President Trump asserted that he threatened both nations with trade consequences to push them toward a cease-fire, though the Indian government has downplayed the U.S. role in brokering the truce.</p>

The 59 Afrikaners underwent expedited reviews and were brought to the U.S. on a government-chartered flight, prompting scrutiny from resettlement agencies facing budget cuts. The Episcopal Church ended its refugee partnership, citing moral opposition to preferential treatment for white Afrikaners, while the Trump administration asserts that Afrikaners face persecution in South Africa. The U.S. Embassy in South Africa published a notice about the refugee admissions program for Afrikaners and disfavored minorities facing racial discrimination.</p>

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to drastically reduce tariffs on one another for the next 90 days as they continue to negotiate a more permanent trade deal, providing welcome news for investors, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. The temporary truce will see the United States lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%, starting Wednesday. However, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still impact American consumers, and shipping costs are expected to rise as manufacturers attempt to compensate for lost time. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent secured a commitment from China to cut non-tariff barriers, but experts warn that a tough road lies ahead.</p>

President Trump directed his government to allow South Africans of European descent to be resettled through the U.S. refugee program, alleging they have faced discrimination, particularly through a controversial land seizure law, while the South African government maintains that the law respects private property rights.</p>

The Trump administration plans to install new fiber-optic cables connecting the airport and the facility, which was recently moved from Long Island to Philadelphia, and the FAA has convened a task force to address the problems.</p>

Scientists discovered that certain bright spots seen in Webb's images did not appear in Hubble's counterparts, opening new questions about the universe.

Mexico's Agriculture Secretary expressed disagreement with the measure but confidence in reaching an agreement, while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum described the Trump administration's decision as "unfair."

Four Democratic members of the Senate foreign relations committee said on Monday that they would press for a vote later this week, citing concerns about conflicts of interest and threats to national security. The plan appears to be for the 13-year-old plane to be fitted out by the US military for use as Air Force One and then, when Trump leaves the White House, for it to be put on display in his presidential library – in effect being handed to Trump for his own personal use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary but significant easing of tariffs imposed over the last couple months, according to this CBS News article. The countries said they had agreed that ongoing discussions have the potential to address the concerns of each side in their economic and trade relationship, and have committed to a 90-day suspension of most of the levies imposed since early April. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China will reduce levies on American imports to 10%, with China also agreeing to ease some non-tariff barriers, potentially including resuming export of rare earths to U.S. customers.</p>

The play is less of a play than an interactive theatrical experience where audience members are summoned to the stage at random by the unrehearsed actor. The play explores themes of brutal authority and moral common sense, and depends on the curiosity of ordinary theatergoers to make a deeper impression.</p>

          <p>President Trump said weekend talks had resulted in a "total reset" in trade terms between the US and China, a move which goes some way to defuse the high stakes stand-off between the two countries, according to this BBC article. The talks in Switzerland resulted in significant cuts to the tit-for-tat tariffs that had been stacked up since January on both sides, with the US lowering those tariffs from 145% to 30%, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods will drop to 10% from 125%. President Trump told reporters that, as some of the levies have been suspended rather than cancelled altogether, they might rise again in three months time, if no further progress was made.</p>

A spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party said it was an important step towards a country free of terror. In this majority Kurdish city in south-eastern Turkey - the de facto Kurdish capital - we found a muted response to PKK's announcement.</p>
