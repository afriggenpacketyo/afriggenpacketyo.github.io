          <p>Forecasters are monitoring Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic and is expected to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain as early models project it could become a major hurricane near the Caribbean. The storm has already caused at least eight deaths and significant flooding in the Cabo Verde islands, prompting a state of emergency. This activity aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season in the Atlantic basin.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder following a failed 2019 assassination attempt in Birmingham, UK.

After fleeing the country and spending nearly five years on the run, she was extradited from Armenia to face trial, where a jury convicted her on multiple charges related to the sophisticated murder plot.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, a figure slightly below economists' expectations, while core inflation, which excludes food and energy, increased 3.1%. The report indicates that the impact of President Trump's tariffs is present but not yet causing major alarm, with rising shelter costs being a key driver of the increase. This data comes amid political pressure on the Bureau of Labor Statistics and keeps the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September on the table. (not investment advice)</p>

The law requires large online platforms to implement age verification systems to prevent children from accessing pornographic or harmful material, leading to complaints about privacy and censorship. The measures have prompted a surge in VPN use in the U.K. and drawn criticism from American officials who fear it could chill free expression and unfairly target U.S. tech firms.</p>

          <p>A teacher at Centreville High School in Virginia, Zenaida Perez, claims she repeatedly tried to expose an alleged scandal where a school social worker arranged and paid for a student's abortion in 2021 without parental consent. Perez alleges that despite her multiple warnings to school and district officials since May 2022, her concerns were ignored and met with retaliation. The school district has now launched an external investigation, stating it only recently learned of the allegations, a claim Perez disputes with detailed records.</p>

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their accounts but do not need the funds for living expenses, several financial strategies are available. Experts suggest reinvesting the money into a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to maintain long-term growth. Another popular option for those aged 70½ or older is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which satisfies the RMD requirement while avoiding an increase in adjusted gross income.

The shift aims to avoid price hikes for U.S. consumers during the holiday season and buys time for broader trade negotiations covering technology and rare earths, where China holds significant leverage. While countries like India now face steeper tariffs, China's willingness to engage in a full-blown trade war may have forced the Trump administration to seek a less confrontational path.</p>

          <h2>China Initiates Anti-Dumping Probe into Canadian Pea Starch Imports</h2>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched an anti-dumping investigation into pea starch imported from Canada, a move seen as retaliation for Canadian tariffs on Chinese steel. The ministry stated the probe was requested by domestic producers who claim they are being harmed by a surge of low-priced Canadian pea starch. This action follows the launch of similar investigations into Canadian canola oil and rubber, escalating trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread nostalgia for the 1990s, an analysis of data suggests that the present day is superior in several key areas. The article argues that while people remember the 90s for economic growth and cultural hits, they often forget the decade's record-high violent crime rates and the unchecked HIV/AIDS pandemic. Furthermore, global extreme poverty was vastly higher, while social tolerance for issues like same-sex marriage was significantly lower, indicating that "the good old days" are often viewed through a distorted lens.</p>

          <p>Newly released school records for the Uvalde gunman reveal a significant decline from a motivated young learner to a troubled teen with escalating academic and behavioral issues. The files, released after a long legal battle, show that Salvador Ramos was suspended multiple times in middle school and withdrew from high school due to poor performance months before the 2022 attack. While the documents do not shed new light on the criticized police response, they provide a more detailed timeline of the shooter's downward spiral.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Chris Nowinski, co-founder of the UNITE Brain Bank, explains the process of procuring brains from former athletes for the study of CTE, a neurodegenerative disease linked to head trauma. He notes that while the NFL has taken steps to reduce concussions, the issue has faded from public discourse partly because the league stopped denying the link and media coverage has fractured. Nowinski emphasizes that CTE risk remains a significant issue, especially at college and high school levels, where safety measures often lag behind the NFL's.</p>

This erosion of public health infrastructure and trust risks long-term damage, reversing decades of progress against preventable diseases and potentially leading to a lost generation of scientific talent.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, the underlying trade tensions are expected to continue altering global shipping routes throughout the year. Analysts predict a full-year decline in container volumes on the transpacific lane, which will maintain downward pressure on freight rates that have already fallen for nine consecutive weeks. In response, shipping giants like Maersk are seeing contractions in North American imports offset by strong growth in trade with Europe, Latin America, and other regions.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's on-demand delivery channel, Taobao Shangou, reportedly overtook rival Meituan in daily orders, fueled by an aggressive subsidy strategy to gain market share in China's competitive market. While Meituan typically dominates, its temporary halt of a promotional campaign allowed Alibaba to pull ahead, demonstrating the power of subsidies in influencing consumer behavior. According to a Morgan Stanley analysis, this intense competition is shifting the industry towards a duopoly, with both companies projected to hold nearly equal market shares by 2030.</p>
