          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, resulting in at least 19 injuries, four of which were serious. The incident occurred around 8:30 p.m. and prompted a temporary closure of the bridge. City officials stated that the bridge did not appear to sustain any structural damage, and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue with the sailboat. The vessel was disembarking and en route to Iceland when the collision happened, creating a dramatic scene along the New York City waterfront.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for answers in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators initially focused on Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but his alibi and footprint analysis cleared him. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile repeating itself on multiple items at the crime scene. Investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to two brothers, one of whom was Jerry Westrom, a businessman and hockey dad. Westrom was eventually arrested and tried, with the bloody footprints playing a key role in his conviction.</p>

Walmart responded that it would do its best to keep prices low but could not absorb all the pressure from the tariffs. Economists noted that it was inevitable that tariffs would drive up prices, as businesses could not absorb all the costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Reform UK has stated that the far-right is not welcome and that they have stringent vetting processes. The strategy involves small anti-immigration parties standing aside to improve Reform's chances and far-right activists campaigning against Reform's opponents.</p>

          <p>President Trump has warned Walmart against raising prices, telling the company to "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs onto consumers. This followed Walmart's warning that tariffs would lead to higher prices on various goods. Trump insisted that Walmart, having made billions, should sacrifice profits for his economic agenda. A Walmart spokesperson stated that the company would keep prices as low as possible, given retail margins. The situation highlights the pressure on American companies due to Trump's trade policies.</p>

A judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, and their fate now rests with California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who must weigh public opinion and political considerations.
