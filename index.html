            <p>The White House is standing by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth after reports surfaced that he shared sensitive information about potential strikes in Yemen within a second Signal group chat. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed concerns, attributing the leaks to disgruntled former Pentagon employees and asserting that no classified information was compromised in the Signal chats. Leavitt maintains that Hegseth is doing a tremendous job and has the President's full support despite the controversy. This defense comes amidst a sweeping leak investigation within the Pentagon. </p>

The agency's director was recently fired, and the administration has signaled a willingness to shut it down, leading to legal challenges and debates about its role in regulating the financial industry. </p>

Costco's reputation as a prepper paradise is subtly embraced by the brand, which sells non-perishable foods, water purification kits, and even gold bars. However, while prepperism is often associated with right-wing politics, Costco maintains diversity and inclusion initiatives. </p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could impact access to preventive care services under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The dispute centers on the structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations on preventive medical services. A lower court found the task force's structure unconstitutional, potentially jeopardizing no-cost coverage for services like cancer screenings and HIV-prevention drugs. The case raises questions about the appointment and oversight of the task force members and the impact on millions of Americans. </p>

            <p>An escalating trade war with the United States could benefit China's satellite industry by encouraging the substitution of domestic technology for foreign parts, according to an industry insider. The trade restrictions could affect up to 30 per cent of US-sourced specialised satellite components. The higher production costs were due to the smaller scale production of newer Chinese aerospace products that were not yet being widely used in the commercial space sector. This shift could accelerate China's efforts to compete with companies like SpaceX's Starlink. </p>
