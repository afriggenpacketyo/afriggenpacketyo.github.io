          <p>Shares of design software company Figma experienced a significant 27% drop, erasing a large portion of the gains from its successful IPO last week. The company, which recently went public on the New York Stock Exchange, had initially seen its stock price more than triple. This volatility comes despite Figma's consistent profitability and strong revenue growth, a rarity among recent tech IPOs. The company's valuation remains substantially higher than the price Adobe offered in a failed acquisition attempt in 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's stock declined following the release of its second-quarter earnings, which showed a 4% dip in operating profits. The results were dragged down by a drop in insurance underwriting, disappointing investors. The company also surprised many by recording a $3.8 billion loss on its Kraft Heinz stake and abstaining from stock buybacks, despite holding a near-record cash hoard of $344.1 billion. This conservative financial activity comes as the conglomerate prepares for CEO-designate Greg Abel to take over from Warren Buffett at the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack has warned that Americans may soon face higher inflation as businesses begin to pass on the costs of tariffs. Many companies had initially absorbed these costs by using stockpiled inventory, but are now facing squeezed profit margins. Hammack suggested inflation could reach a 3% annual rate, exceeding the Fed's 2% target, and highlighted the existence of a "two-speed economy" where high-income earners thrive while low-income households struggle with rising costs. This situation creates a challenging dilemma for the Federal Reserve as it balances controlling inflation with supporting a slowing labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The official also accused the U.S. and EU of hypocrisy, pointing out their continued trade with Russia in other sectors like uranium and industrial goods. This response comes after President Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Indian goods, accusing the nation of profiting from the war in Ukraine.</p>

A manhunt is still underway for the primary suspect, Austin Robert Drummond, who police believe had a relationship with the family and targeted them. A reward is being offered for information leading to his arrest, and he is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza are criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported plan to prioritize military action for their release. Following the collapse of ceasefire talks, reports suggest Netanyahu favors a "decisive military victory," a strategy that hostage families fear will endanger their loved ones. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum condemned the approach, calling it a "fraud" that could lead to devastation. This comes after Hamas released distressing videos showing hostages in poor health, increasing pressure on all parties to find a resolution.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating Fixed vs. Variable Annuities in the Current Economic Climate</h2>

          <p>This article explores the choice between fixed and variable annuities for retirement planning amidst current economic conditions of high interest rates and market volatility. Fixed annuities offer predictable, guaranteed returns, making them attractive for risk-averse individuals, especially with rates potentially falling later in the year. Conversely, variable annuities provide the potential for higher, market-linked growth, which may better protect against long-term inflation for those with a higher risk tolerance. The best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court case challenging President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs is anticipated to be appealed to the Supreme Court. The case centers on whether the president exceeded his power under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his "Liberation Day" tariffs. A lower court previously blocked the tariffs, but an appeals court stayed that decision, allowing them to remain in force pending a final ruling. Legal experts expect the appeals court decision within weeks, setting a timeline that could allow the Supreme Court to hear the pivotal case on executive power this term.</p>

This practice, which the zoo says is common in Denmark, is part of an effort to imitate the natural food chain and provide enrichment.

A new study has pinpointed a specific bacterium, *Vibrio pectinocida*, as the cause of the epidemic, which was particularly devastating to the sunflower sea star. The collapse of the sunflower sea star population, a keystone predator, led to an explosion of sea urchins that have decimated vital kelp forests. This discovery is a critical breakthrough, enabling more targeted conservation efforts, including developing diagnostic tests and breeding disease-resistant sea stars.</p>

          <p>A manhunt for military veteran Michael Paul Brown, the suspect in a fatal shooting that killed four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has entered its fourth day. Brown, 45, allegedly shot the victims, all of whom he knew, before fleeing. Authorities believe he is still armed and dangerous and have offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. The search involves multiple agencies scouring the rugged terrain near Anaconda, an area familiar to Brown from his youth. Relatives of the suspect have stated that he has struggled with mental illness for years.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the league in several offensive categories, the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup has struggled significantly since the beginning of July. This article analyzes the performance issues of three key stars: Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Teoscar Hernández. Betts is experiencing a season-long power outage, Ohtani's production has dipped since he resumed pitching, and Hernández has not returned to his early-season form after a groin injury. The team is counting on these core players to regain their consistency for a successful stretch run and defense of their World Series title.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is scheduled to execute inmate Byron Black, despite legal challenges concerning his implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Black's attorneys argued that the device could deliver painful shocks during the lethal injection process, but the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to deactivate it. The state contends that even if the ICD were to activate, Black would be rendered unconscious by the lethal drug and would not feel it. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters, and his case has raised unique questions about medical ethics and execution procedures.</p>

          <p>An ex-girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was previously identified as a victim and slated to testify against him, has written a letter to the judge advocating for his release on bail.

This development comes as Combs' legal team continues to push for his release ahead of his October sentencing for transportation to engage in prostitution.

          <p>The July jobs report, which showed a meager gain of 73,000 nonfarm payrolls and significant downward revisions for the previous two months, confirms that the U.S. economy is slowing considerably. The three-month average for job gains has fallen to just 35,000, pointing to weakened momentum that elevates the risk of a recession. Economists cite concerns that the impact of tariffs will continue to depress consumer spending and business investment. The weak labor market data intensifies pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk an interim compensation package of 96 million shares, currently valued at approximately $29 billion. This award is intended as a placeholder while the company appeals a Delaware court ruling that voided his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018. The new shares will vest in two years, provided Musk remains in a top executive role, and will be forfeited if the original package is legally reinstated. The move aims to incentivize Musk to remain at the company's helm amid flagging sales and his increasing focus on other ventures like xAI and political activities.</p>

Her leadership period was marked by significant changes, including MI5 taking lead responsibility for countering Irish republican terrorism in Great Britain.

          <p>Student loan borrowers who remain in the now-defunct SAVE forbearance plan will face significant financial consequences as interest resumed accruing on August 1. Staying in the payment pause means their loan balances will grow, and they will not make any progress toward loan forgiveness programs like PSLF. Experts advise that most borrowers should switch to an available income-driven repayment plan, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, to manage their debt effectively. The Department of Education will likely automatically move remaining borrowers into a new plan by 2028, but taking proactive steps now is recommended. (not investment advice)</p>
