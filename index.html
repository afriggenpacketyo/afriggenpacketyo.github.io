            <p>The National Park Service has reinstated an image and quote of Harriet Tubman on its Underground Railroad webpage following public criticism regarding their removal. Private cultural organizations, such as the Harriet Tubman Museum of New Jersey, are intensifying efforts to preserve American history. The museum's executive director, Cindy Mullock, emphasized the commitment to accurately depicting history, drawing inspiration from Tubman's bravery. The NPS stated that the changes were made without approval from leadership, prompting the restoration of the webpages.</p>

            <p>U.S. missionary Pastor Josh Sullivan was abducted at gunpoint from his church in Motherwell, South Africa, during a sermon, according to police and colleagues.

Sullivan, who arrived from Tennessee in 2018, was holding a prayer meeting with about 30 people when the armed kidnappers entered.

            <p>An opinion piece argues against using hallucinogens for spiritual growth, suggesting that the Torah promotes finding spirituality in everyday activities. The author references passages that emphasize the importance of ethical principles, moral laws, and daily interactions in experiencing holiness. By conceiving actions, meals, conversations, decisions, and interactions as opportunities to do something holy, people can fill their days with profound spiritual experiences. The author suggests this approach is more dependable, meaningful, and safe than using drugs to achieve spiritual highs.</p>

            <p>A report by the Foundation for Defence of Democracies reveals that US support for Ukraine has not slowed the provision of weapons to Taiwan or Israel, but supply chain problems exist. The study tracked 25 items provided to Taiwan and Ukraine, with only seven having a strong defense industrial base in the United States. The authors warned that insufficient spending has damaged US defense industrial bases, potentially hindering the country's ability to sustain weapon supplies to its partners. The report calls for prudent reforms and substantial new investments to address these weaknesses.</p>

The war has transformed Ukraine into a nation of drone-makers, with both factory assembly lines and small operations contributing to the effort.</p>

            <p>Seed oils, including canola, soybean, and corn oils, are poised to benefit from the ongoing trade war due to their affordability. Despite being maligned by some, there is no scientific evidence to suggest they are unhealthy. In contrast, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s view on fats is about bucking convention, not promoting health. Experts suggest that olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil, and avocado oil are all healthy choices for cooking.</p>

            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink envisions a future where all assets, from stocks to real estate, are tokenized and tradable on a blockchain. This revolution in investing could lead to 24-hour markets and faster settlement processes. However, the lack of a coordinated digital identity verification system poses a significant challenge. Experts agree that cybersecurity concerns must be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of tokenized assets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Trade and capitalism have been crucial in reducing global poverty, as evidenced by the sharp historical decline in extreme poverty. The world has experienced an unprecedented decline in extreme poverty since 1990, largely due to the opening up of economies to globalization. China's economic growth, in particular, has lifted 800 million people out of extreme poverty. The rise of global supply chains and international trade has contributed to this progress, although it has also had downsides, such as environmental destruction and social disruption.</p>

            <p>High winds and the threat of sandstorms prompted Beijing to cancel hundreds of flights and close public parks.

The Universal Studios theme park and historic sites like the Forbidden City have been closed. High winds and sandstorms are generated in China's dry north, where the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts are located.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policies have created economic turmoil, raising the danger of a US default. The president's flip-flop on tariffs has led to market instability, increased interest rates, and a growing possibility of recession. The bond market has reacted negatively, forcing the US government to pay more to borrow. Some see a battle with China, one of the largest holders of US debt, as a key factor in Trump's economic policies.</p>

            <p>Britishisms are increasingly making their way into American English, with Gen Z helping to fuel the import of words like "bonkers" and "cheeky." Researchers have identified the most commonly used Britishisms in American English, noting that social media and streaming services are contributing to this phenomenon. Americans generally welcome the linguistic imports, finding them more vivid or useful than their American counterparts. The exchange of phrases is seen as a healthy thing, enriching the language.</p>
