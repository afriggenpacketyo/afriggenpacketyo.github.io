          <p>Investors are closely monitoring three major factors influencing the stock market this week: escalating U.S.-China tensions, concerns about credit quality, and the ongoing federal government shutdown. Earnings season is ramping up, with several S&P 500 companies, including Danaher and Capital One, scheduled to report results. Additionally, the shutdown has delayed official government economic data, though the Bureau of Labor Statistics is prioritizing the CPI report for Social Security adjustments.

          <p>A five-day strike involving thousands of Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers in California and Hawaii has ended, with unions expressing renewed momentum for negotiations. While no agreement was reached, bargaining is scheduled to resume this week between Kaiser officials and the United Nurses Assns. of California/Union of Healthcare Professionals (UNAC/UHCP). Key points of contention include the union's demand for a 25% wage increase over four years and increased staffing, which the union links to patient safety. Kaiser, however, maintains that wages are the primary issue, asserting that its employees already earn above-market rates.</p>

The soldier expressed a desire to resettle in the South, marking the first reported defection by a North Korean soldier via the land border since August 2024. Despite the Demilitarized Zone's extensive defenses, such defections, while rare, highlight the persistent tensions and desperate conditions in North Korea.

          <p>Disgraced former Republican US Representative George Santos, recently released from prison after President Trump commuted his seven-year sentence, has declared a new mission: prison reform. Santos, who served 84 days for wire fraud and identity theft, described his experience in federal prison as "dehumanising" and "humbling," citing issues like rotting facilities and thick black mold. He informed Trump of his desire to contribute to the administration's prison reform efforts. This article outlines Santos's newfound focus and his criticisms of the U.S. correctional system.</p>

          <p>The government shutdown, now in its 19th day, continues as Democratic and Republican senators remain at odds over a resolution. Arizona Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly believes the shutdown could end this week if Republicans negotiate on health care subsidies, which are set to expire, causing premiums to rise. Conversely, Alabama Republican Sen.

          <p>The Trump administration carried out its seventh known strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel since last month, resulting in three fatalities, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced. The article states that the latest strike targeted a boat linked to a Colombian guerrilla group, occurring in international waters within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility. These strikes, which have killed at least 32 people, are justified by the administration as combating drug trafficking under a "non-international armed conflict" framework. However, lawmakers, including Sen. Mark Kelly, have questioned the legal rationale and constitutionality of these military operations.</p>

However, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth, and inconsistencies in regional classifications make comparisons challenging. Indonesia remains a notable exception with high male tobacco use and strong industry influence, while the region also grapples with the rising popularity of e-cigarettes.</p>

This agreement, reached with the American Federation of Teachers, means the Education Department will again process forgiveness for eligible borrowers in the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans. The administration had previously paused these cancellations, citing court orders related to the SAVE plan.

          <p>Bolivia is poised for a significant political shift as voters head to a presidential run-off election between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz. This election follows two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule, which ended due to voter frustration over infighting and fuel shortages. The country is grappling with its worst economic crisis in decades, including a severe US dollar shortage and high inflation. Both candidates promise to stabilize the economy, fix the exchange rate, and attract foreign investment, signaling a move away from populist policies and towards stronger ties with the U.S.</p>

Polanski estimates such a tax could raise £15bn-£25bn annually, emphasizing its primary goal is reducing inequality rather than solely funding public investment. The article notes that critics argue such a tax could penalize savings and encourage wealthy individuals to leave the country. Polanski also advocates for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, focusing on the "super wealthy" to address societal imbalances.</p>
