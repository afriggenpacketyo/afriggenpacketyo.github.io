          <p>Daniel Gunter has been found guilty of murdering his two-week-old premature son, Brendon Staddon, in Yeovil District Hospital's special care baby unit. Brendon suffered extensive and horrific injuries, including a fractured skull, broken neck, jaw, and legs, consistent with his head being swung against a hard surface multiple times. Nursing staff had previously voiced numerous concerns about Gunter's behavior and repeated rough handling of the infant during his brief life. While Brendon's mother, Sophie Staddon, was acquitted of a lesser charge, Gunter showed no remorse during the trial, prompting the judge to remand him into custody pending sentencing for this profoundly tragic crime.</p>

          <h2>Sydney Sweeney Campaign Fuels American Eagle Meme Stock Rally</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' stock surged by over 13%, positioning it as a new "meme stock," driven by high short interest and inherent brand recognition, notably a new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. This rally follows similar volatile trading for other stocks like GoPro and Krispy Kreme earlier in the week, as retail investors send specific stocks on wild rides. Sweeney's endorsement for American Eagle's denim line aligns with a growing preference for the fabric amid a boom in popularity for Western styles. The sudden surge provides a significant, albeit potentially temporary, reprieve for the stock, which had tumbled around 35% so far in 2025.</p>

          <h2>Cedar Point Roller Coaster Malfunctions Third Time, Stranding Riders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:33:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "Siren's Curse" roller coaster at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, malfunctioned for the third time since its June 28 opening, leaving riders suspended at a 45-degree angle for about 20 minutes. A park spokesperson stated the coaster's safety system performed as designed, ensuring all guests exited safely before the ride quickly reopened. This incident follows two previous malfunctions: one on opening weekend where passengers were suspended facing down, and another on July 2 that required a stair evacuation. The recurring issues raise public concern about the new ride's operational reliability, despite the park's assurances regarding safety protocols.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) maintained interest rates on Thursday, keeping its key deposit facility at 2%, following four consecutive cuts earlier this year. This decision comes amidst significant economic uncertainty, particularly regarding ongoing trade disputes between the EU and the U.S. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that while the euro zone economy performed better than expected in Q1, growth risks are "tilted to the downside" due to potential tariff escalations. The bank is closely monitoring the situation, including the euro's appreciation and global supply chain fragmentation, describing the current stance as "wait and watch" while keeping all options open.

The airline is also overhauling its business model, moving from open seating to assigned seats and new boarding orders, which initially impacted basic economy sales.

          <p>Slovenia, a nation of just over two million people, boasts remarkable sporting success, exemplified by Tour de France star Tadej Pogacar and NBA player Luka Doncic. This achievement is attributed to a robust foundation laid in schools, where highly trained physical education teachers and small class sizes foster high physical literacy across the population. The national SLOfit program, monitoring children's physical development since 1987, also plays a crucial role in identifying talent and guiding physical activity. Additionally, the country's diverse geography and a sports culture not solely dominated by soccer contribute significantly to its athletic prowess and national self-esteem.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has launched an ambitious "24-hour economy" initiative, aiming to diversify the nation's economy and create 1.7 million jobs by tripling the operating hours of vital industries. The plan seeks to transform Ghana from an import-dependent to a self-sufficient economy, with public and private sectors collaborating on three eight-hour shifts daily. While theoretically promising for boosting GDP and employment, economists and local observers express concerns regarding the substantial $4 billion funding needed and the country's existing infrastructure challenges, such as unreliable power supply. The initiative represents a bold shift in mindset for the nation.</p>

These new aerogels overcome the traditional weakness of poor mechanical strength, making them highly elastic and suitable for extreme applications, such as shielding aircraft. The "2D channel-confined chemistry" method, utilizing nanoscale graphene oxide during production, allows for the derivation of hundreds of formulations, each exhibiting high elasticity.
