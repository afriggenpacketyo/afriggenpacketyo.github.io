          <p>Austin Robert Drummond, 28, has been arrested in Tennessee following a weeklong manhunt for his alleged role in a quadruple homicide. Authorities accuse him of killing four members of his girlfriend's family, including her mother, sister, and the parents of an infant he later abandoned. The baby was found safe in a car seat outside a stranger's home, which initiated the investigation and search. Drummond faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder, and was previously convicted for armed robbery.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed. A lead forecaster explains that the atmosphere is a "chaotic system," where minor initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, a concept known as the Butterfly Effect. The article discusses the difficulty of predicting weather for small geographic areas and the challenge of condensing complex meteorological data for public consumption. Future improvements may come from AI, but communicating uncertainty and impact will remain a key task for human forecasters.</p>

          <p>A San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputy, Cameron Romo, has been arrested and charged with soliciting bribes and committing extortion while on duty. The charges stem from a citizen complaint filed in June 2024, which led to an internal investigation and Romo being placed on administrative leave. The 27-year-old deputy, who has been with the department since 2020, was booked into the Central Detention Center. Sheriff Shannon Dicus stated it was unfortunate but expressed pride in the investigators for holding the deputy accountable.</p>

          <p>The political conflict in Texas has intensified as Democratic state lawmakers fled to Illinois to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. In response, U.S. Senator John Cornyn has requested FBI assistance in locating the absent legislators, while Governor Greg Abbott has sued to remove a key Democrat from office. The walkout denies the state House a quorum, stalling the legislative process. This move is part of a larger national battle over gerrymandering, with Democratic states like California and Illinois threatening to redraw their own maps in retaliation.</p>

          <p>A recent Realtor.com report shows that home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering slight relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, largely due to increased housing inventory from a pandemic-era building boom and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to see rising prices and limited supply, creating a divided national housing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to terminate approximately $7 billion in grant funding awarded through the Solar for All program, which aims to help low- and middle-income households install solar panels. This action targets funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that have already been awarded to 60 state agencies and other entities. While the administration has previously clawed back unobligated funds, this move to cancel awarded grants is expected to face legal challenges. This is the latest in a series of administration actions targeting clean energy initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced a new proposal to streamline the process for businesses to use drones for commercial purposes, such as deliveries and inspections. Previously, companies required a case-by-case waiver to operate drones beyond the pilot's line of sight, a process officials say has stifled innovation. The proposed rules would establish industry standards for drone construction, require collision avoidance technology, and ban flights over large crowds. The move is intended to create a clear regulatory framework to safely integrate commercial drones into U.S. airspace.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The committee is examining the federal government's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. The letters cite Bill Clinton's documented travel on Epstein's private plane as a reason for the summons. The move is part of a broader set of subpoenas targeting high-profile figures, including former attorneys general and FBI directors.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is alerting the public after wild pigs trapped in Monterey County were discovered to have bright blue muscle and fat tissue. Officials believe the coloration is a sign the animals have consumed diphacinone, a type of rat poison used in agriculture that is often dyed blue. Because the poison can remain in the tissue, authorities are warning hunters and others not to consume any animal with such pigmentation due to the risk of secondary poisoning. The discovery highlights the unintended consequences of rodenticides on the wider ecosystem.</p>

Banks can close accounts for various reasons, including suspected fraud or regulatory compliance under the Bank Secrecy Act, and are often not required to provide a reason. While banking leaders deny political bias, pointing to risk management as the driver of their decisions, the issue has prompted calls for an executive order to provide regulatory clarity and prevent discriminatory practices.</p>

          <p>The term "Russia hoax," frequently used by Donald Trump, refers to his assertion that investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election were a politically motivated witch hunt. This article explains that despite the claim's persistence, U.S. intelligence and a bipartisan Senate report concluded Russia did interfere to help Trump. The "hoax" narrative has been fueled by the discrediting of some specific claims, like the Steele dossier, and a special counsel report that did not charge Trump with a crime. The phrase continues to be a central part of a political strategy to cast doubt on the investigations.</p>

Investigators found that the sub's design was fundamentally flawed and that OceanGate ignored warnings about hull damage from previous incidents.
