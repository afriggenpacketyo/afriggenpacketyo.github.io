          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is set to lose a significant portion of its federal research funding from agencies like the NIH and NSF. The federal government cited concerns over antisemitism and bias on campus as the reason for the suspension, a move that could affect hundreds of life-saving research grants. UCLA's chancellor expressed deep disappointment, stating the penalty does not effectively address the alleged discrimination and harms national interests that depend on the university's groundbreaking work. This development follows a recent $6 million settlement the university paid to Jewish students who alleged they were blocked from accessing campus by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.</p>

          <p>Chevron announced a significant drop in its second-quarter profits, with net income falling by 44% to $2.49 billion compared to the previous year. The decline was attributed to lower crude oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop in net income, the company's adjusted earnings per share beat Wall Street expectations. The acquisition of Hess, which adds key assets in Guyana and the U.S., is expected to start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter as Chevron aims for significant cost reductions.</p>

          <p>A woman whose 79-year-old mother was killed in a car crash in Cornwall is advocating for an overhaul of the UK's regulations for older drivers, calling the current system "unsafe and inadequate." The current rules rely on drivers over 70 to self-declare medical conditions affecting their ability to drive when renewing their license every three years. With an aging population, statistics show drivers over 75 are at a higher risk of being killed or seriously injured. While some older drivers in rural areas view driving as a lifeline, road safety advocates and medical professionals are supporting mandatory health checks to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Police in Leicestershire, UK, have arrested a 76-year-old man on suspicion of administering a noxious substance after eight children and one adult fell ill at a summer camp in Stathern. The nine individuals were hospitalized on Monday but have since been discharged. The incident prompted a large emergency response, with neighbors describing chaotic scenes as a local village hall was used as a triage center for the affected children. The police force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over its handling of the initial report of children feeling unwell a day before officers visited the camp.</p>

The lawsuit was filed by three of the founder's extramarital children against their half-sister, Kelly Zong Fuli, who is now the company's CEO. The plaintiffs claim Zong breached a family agreement to establish offshore trusts for them totaling US$2.1 billion following their father's death. The court order will remain in effect pending the resolution of a parallel lawsuit in mainland China, with Wahaha Group stating the legal disputes are unrelated to its operations.</p>

          <p>Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has sold his final equity stake in the firm and stepped down from its board, completing a management transition he began in 2022. The move finalizes his shift away from management, though he will remain a significant investor and a mentor to the firm's leadership. Dalio founded Bridgewater in 1975 and built it into a powerhouse known for its macro strategies. The transition was facilitated by a capital raise from existing investors and employees, with co-CIOs Bob Prince and Greg Jensen now being major equity holders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having an emergency savings fund significantly reduces the likelihood of individuals tapping into their 401(k) retirement accounts prematurely. The study found that investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are much less likely to take out 401(k) loans or make hardship withdrawals. This cash buffer is especially critical for hourly workers, who often have more volatile incomes and are more prone to early 401(k) withdrawals. Experts emphasize that even small, automated contributions to a liquid, high-yield savings account can build a crucial financial safety net over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rising global temperatures are profoundly impacting mountaineering, increasing objective dangers like rockfalls and avalanches on the world's highest peaks. Glaciers are melting at an accelerated rate, removing the natural "glue" of snow and ice that holds rocks in place, as seen on mountains like Laila Peak in Pakistan. This forces expeditions to adjust schedules, often climbing at night to avoid the warmest, most dangerous parts of the day. The changing climate also leads to more extreme weather, such as heavy rainfall and glacial lake outburst floods, threatening both climbers and local communities economically dependent on mountain tourism.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, the fifth named storm of the season, which is expected to bring disruptive weather to the country on Monday. Forecasts predict the storm will track across the northern UK, with the most severe winds, potentially gusting between 60 and 80 mph, affecting western and southern areas. Even inland regions in the south could experience gusts of 40-45 mph. The storm's intensity is fueled by an active jet stream, and officials warn of potential travel disruptions, damage to temporary structures, and power outages due to the high winds and heavy rain.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative to increase social mobility within Whitehall, the UK government will now restrict its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This determination will be based on their parents' occupations when the student was 14. Successful interns will then be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program for the civil service. The move, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves, though it has drawn criticism from a Conservative shadow minister for being based on "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>A historical analysis details the pervasive surveillance operations of the Stasi, East Germany's Ministry for State Security, which employed around 90,000 full-time staff and up to 200,000 informal collaborators. Under the mantra "we must know everything," the Stasi monitored citizens through mail interception, wiretaps, and intimidation tactics to suppress any opposition to the ruling Socialist Unity Party. Historian Philipp Springer's new book reveals that many joined the Stasi for job security or a sense of power, though the day-to-day work was often mundane. The legacy of the Stasi continues to impact Germany, as citizens can still access their files and discover who informed on them.</p>

The process has been confirmed to be harmless to the rhinos but renders the horns undesirable for consumers and easily traceable for law enforcement.

The article highlights the system's high level of concealment, which could enable the U.S. military to achieve tactical surprise and launch attacks from multiple, dispersed locations.

Bolton argues that Trump's "America First" slogan is not based on a consistent philosophy but rather on the president's immediate instincts, leading to a cabinet of "yes-men" rather than advisors. He expresses concern over the administration's understanding of alliances like NATO and its approach to global crises in Ukraine and the Middle East. Bolton suggests that this transactional, isolationist impulse is a dangerous departure from the post-WWII consensus on America's role in maintaining global stability.</p>

          <p>An abandoned Southern California Edison power line suspected of starting the deadly Eaton fire could have been removed years ago under a safety rule that was weakened following opposition from utility companies. In 2001, state regulators proposed forcing utilities to remove inactive lines, but the final 2005 rule allowed companies to leave them up indefinitely if they determined a "foreseeable future use." This dormant, century-old line is now central to lawsuits alleging it sparked the fire that killed 19 people. Critics, including a retired regulator, argue that intense lobbying from utilities prevented stronger safety measures that could have averted the disaster.</p>

          <p>The Southern California city of Sierra Madre is grappling with a surge in bear-related home intrusions, with 41 incidents reported in June alone, a dramatic increase from previous years. Officials and residents believe the recent Eaton fire has driven bears from their charred habitats into neighborhoods in search of food and water, exacerbating an ongoing human-wildlife conflict. The situation has led to frustration with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which recently euthanized one problematic bear but has faced criticism and funding cuts for its conflict-resolution programs. Local leaders are now discussing regional solutions to address the public safety threat.</p>

          <p>Following Kamala Harris's decision not to run for governor of California, speculation has intensified about a potential 2028 presidential bid, reigniting the debate over whether a woman can win the U.S. presidency. Experts note that while some Democratic donors and strategists express anxiety about running a female candidate after recent losses, others believe the party needs a bold, progressive platform regardless of the candidate's gender. The discussion highlights the challenges female candidates face, including latent sexism, but also points to the potential for a woman of color to mobilize voters with an authentic message for change in a post-Trump political landscape.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic party and progressive culture are increasingly alienating young men, potentially pushing them towards Donald Trump. Citing focus groups and a pattern of media commentary critical of masculinity, the author suggests many men feel overlooked and criticized, leading them to seek validation elsewhere, such as in online communities or by voting for Trump as an act of rebellion. The piece contends that while some of these voters are persuadable, Democrats must change their approach and stop treating masculinity as a problem. The author suggests a failure to do so could be a key factor in a potential Trump victory.</p>

Two weeks later, Fox opened fire on a vehicle carrying four other minors, who survived the attack. Fox, who has a lengthy criminal record, was identified through DNA, video, and cellphone evidence and was found guilty by a jury in March on multiple counts, including murder and attempted murder.</p>

          <p>Despite a statewide ban, foie gras, a product made by force-feeding ducks or geese, has been discovered for sale in several Wild Fork Foods stores in Southern California. The sale violates a California law that prohibits both the production and sale of products resulting from the force-feeding of birds. After being contacted by journalists, the product was removed from shelves, but the incident highlights confusion over enforcement, as state and local agencies deflect responsibility. Animal welfare organizations condemned the sale, describing the production of foie gras as one of the most deliberate forms of animal cruelty in the modern food industry.</p>

Medical societies stress that robust data shows most SSRIs are safe and do not increase birth defect risks, while untreated maternal depression poses significant dangers like preterm birth and suicide.

          <p>Tulip Siddiq, a Labour MP in the UK, is scheduled to face trial in Bangladesh this month on corruption charges, which she denies as politically motivated. The allegations claim she illegally obtained land as part of a broader investigation into the regime of her aunt, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission has confirmed the trial will proceed, even in her absence. Siddiq, who resigned from her ministerial role in January to avoid being a distraction, maintains her innocence and states she has never owned the land in question, calling the proceedings a "baseless and defamatory" smear campaign.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are now seeking a "substantially higher" prison sentence for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, after he was convicted on two prostitution-related charges. In a court filing, prosecutors opposed his request for release on $50 million bail, arguing that the sentencing guidelines could call for a much longer term than the four to five years initially estimated. They contend Combs remains a danger to the community due to an extensive history of violence. The defense argues for a shorter sentence and maintains that Combs is not a flight risk or a danger, citing his desire to be with his children.</p>

Beginning in 2026, single filers can deduct up to $1,000 and married couples filing jointly can deduct up to $2,000 for cash donations. This change is significant as approximately 90% of filers currently take the standard deduction and thus cannot write off charitable gifts.

Lawmakers passed only $40 million for school construction, of which Governor Mike Dunleavy vetoed nearly $28 million, citing a state budget deficit caused by falling oil revenues. For decades, the state has ignored warnings about its over-reliance on oil and has failed to implement alternative revenue sources like an income or sales tax. This inaction leaves many remote, primarily Indigenous schools in deteriorating and unsafe conditions.</p>
