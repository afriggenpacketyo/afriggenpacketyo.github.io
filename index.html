          <h2>SpaceX's Starship Experiences Uncontrolled Reentry After Losing Contact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever constructed, experienced an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere after mission control lost contact with its upper stage during its ninth uncrewed test flight. The rocket, intended for interplanetary travel, leaked fuel, spun out of control, and likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX confirmed a "rapid unscheduled disassembly," attributing the loss of control to a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage. Despite the failure, SpaceX emphasized that the test would provide valuable data to improve Starship's reliability for future missions aimed at making life multiplanetary. The last sentence of the article indicates that SpaceX will use the data to improve Starship's reliability.</p>

          <h2>Unemployment Rises Among Recent College Graduates, Research Shows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment, with their unemployment rate nearing 6%, surpassing the national average. This cohort accounts for 12% of the rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023, despite making up only 5% of the labor force. The report attributes this trend to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech industry, which is experiencing automation and AI-driven job displacement. Economic uncertainty and cautious hiring practices by businesses are also contributing factors, potentially leading to continued upward pressure on unemployment rates among recent graduates.

According to a study published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, even minor track imperfections can cause severe turbulence in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. However, the engineers say they have discovered a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, lowering "extremely severe bumps" to levels that are "pronounced, but not unpleasant." The researchers used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests to reach their findings.</p>

Affected residents describe their experiences as a nightmare, witnessing their former homes fall into disrepair. Despite the cancellation, significant funds have already been spent on the project, and costs continue to rise due to ongoing maintenance and insurance obligations on the unused properties.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a slight increase in early trading after the U.S. government barred Chevron from exporting crude oil from Venezuela under a new authorization. This restriction raises concerns about potential supply tightness, leading to increased reliance on Middle Eastern crude. The Trump administration's decision reverses a previous license, impacting Venezuelan oil output, which had seen a slight recovery due to foreign company licenses. Market sentiment is also influenced by ongoing Iran-U.S. nuclear talks and expectations regarding OPEC+ output decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump will issue a full pardon to Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of the reality television show “Chrisley Knows Best,” who were convicted of financial fraud and tax evasion. Trump called their treatment “pretty harsh” and said their treatment exemplifies the weaponization of justice against conservatives. The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million to support their luxurious lifestyle. Their lawyer connected the prosecutors in the Chrisleys’ case to Fani T. Willis, the Georgia state prosecutor who brought an election interference case against Trump in 2023.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his "disappointment" with the price tag of the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House, which was heavily backed by President Trump. Musk stated that the bill increases the budget deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The bill, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, impose work requirements on Medicaid and roll back clean energy tax credits. Musk's comments suggest a divergence in opinion with Trump regarding fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a steep decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The percentage of mothers reporting their mental health as "excellent" decreased, while the percentage reporting poor or fair mental health increased, particularly among single parents and those with children on Medicaid or uninsured. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as high housing and childcare costs, food prices, and the unequal burden of household responsibilities. The study highlights the need for greater support and access to mental health care for mothers.</p>

The gas, legally sold for culinary purposes, is being misused recreationally, leading to health issues like hypoxia, nerve damage, and even death. The Annual Report of America's Poison Centers found there was a 58 % increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide in the US between 2023-2024. The loophole allowing its sale, combined with changes in packaging and marketing, has contributed to the rise in misuse among young people.</p>
