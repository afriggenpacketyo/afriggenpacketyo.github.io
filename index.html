          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student who has lived in the United States since she was 4, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Police determined they stopped the wrong vehicle after reviewing dashboard camera footage. Arias Cristobal, who does not qualify for DACA, remains in ICE custody facing deportation, along with her father, who was also arrested following a traffic stop. The assistant Dalton police chief expressed regret over the agency's mistake, with Arias Cristobal's lawyers indicating she will likely remain in custody pending a bond hearing. The article highlights the broader context of increased ICE arrests of undocumented immigrants without criminal records during the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The auction of Louise Riggio's art collection at Christie's in New York, featuring works by masters like Mondrian and Picasso, yielded $272 million, but fell short of pre-sale expectations due to economic uncertainties surrounding President Trump's tariffs. Despite guarantees from the auction house, bidding was subdued, and a major Warhol painting was withdrawn, signaling weakness in that market. While some paintings by artists like Gerhard Richter and Monet sold well, others, like a Fontana, saw a significant drop in value compared to previous sales. The article suggests a cautious outlook for the art market, with experts emphasizing the need for hard work to maintain a healthy market amid financial uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, impacting over 8,000 people who were granted work permits and deportation reprieve due to unsafe conditions in their home country. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that Afghanistan's improved security and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return, reversing the Biden administration's extension of TPS due to the Taliban's takeover and humanitarian crisis. This decision has drawn criticism from advocates who argue it will have long-lasting negative effects, with the Trump administration also seeking to roll back TPS for Venezuela, a move currently halted by a judge. The article highlights the administration's broader efforts to return TPS to its original temporary intent.</p>

The resolution, passed by the DNC's credentials committee, stems from a challenge by Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg. Free alleges that the DNC improperly combined two questions and tallied votes together, giving male candidates an advantage over female candidates. This decision comes amid controversy surrounding Hogg's efforts to primary some Democratic politicians, with DNC Chair Ken Martin emphasizing neutrality in primaries.

These cuts would eliminate funding for NOAA's global CO2 program and end decades of unbroken data collection, degrading the nation's ability to project how climate change could impact the future.

          <p>For the first time in nearly 30 years, the EPA did not release its annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, but data obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) reveals progress in reducing emissions, although not fast enough to meet climate goals. The report, examining data from 1990-2023, found that gross greenhouse gas emissions dropped about 17% since 2005. However, the EDF is concerned that new policies passed by the Trump administration might worsen carbon pollution in the future. The transportation sector remains the top-emitting sector, and the U.S. needs to further accelerate the pace of emissions reductions.</p>
