          <p>Marcus Monzo is on trial for the murder of 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin, who was fatally stabbed while walking to school in Hainault, east London.

Monzo also faces charges related to hurting five other people and aggravated burglary, with the prosecution stating that he shouted about God during the attacks. The defense contends that Monzo's actions were influenced by self-induced intoxication and a pre-existing mental health condition.

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing figures over some of her votes on the Supreme Court, including decisions on foreign aid and Trump's hush money case. Despite this, former President Trump has publicly defended Barrett, whom he appointed, emphasizing her commitment to interpreting the law and Constitution. Some conservative commentators have expressed concerns about her perceived "squishiness," while others accuse Trump of elevating her as a "DEI Hire." Legal experts note that Barrett consistently votes conservatively on key issues, often aligning with Justices Kavanaugh and Alito.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates following a weaker-than-expected private sector jobs report.

The ADP report showed private payrolls increasing by just 37,000 in May, significantly below expectations.

          <p>China has lodged a formal protest against US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for his criticism of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. The Chinese government accused Rubio of distorting historical facts, attacking China's political system, and interfering in its internal affairs. Rubio's statement, published on the State Department's website, praised the courage of the Tiananmen protesters and emphasized the universal principles of freedom and democracy. China views such criticisms as a challenge to its political system and rejects external interference.</p>

The report comes ahead of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a modest gain.

The repetitive and often brutal nature of slaughtering animals can lead to dissociation, substance abuse, and violent thoughts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal challenges to President Trump's tariffs raise significant questions about the separation of powers, a fundamental component of the Constitution's architecture. Two federal courts have ruled that Trump lacks the authority to impose these tariffs, but a specialized federal court has paused enforcement of those decisions. The central issue is whether a 50-year-old statute, the International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977, grants the president the tariff-setting power. The litigation could have major implications for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.</p>
