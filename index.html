          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth convened a Justice Department task force to investigate alleged anti-Christian bias during the Biden administration. The meeting occurred amid scrutiny of Hegseth's communication practices, particularly his sharing of potentially sensitive information in Signal chats, raising concerns about transparency and security protocols. Bondi defended the investigation, citing cases against anti-abortion protesters and FBI scrutiny of traditional Catholics as examples of alleged bias, but the inquiry faces criticism and calls for further investigation into Patel's conduct.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers raises concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Experts warn that garnishing wages will reduce consumer spending, which accounts for a significant portion of U.S. economic activity. While the impact may be smaller than other factors like tariffs, it could compound economic challenges. The resumption of collections ends a pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, adding financial pressure to borrowers already facing economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over potential tariff-related price increases, American consumers remain loyal to iPhones, according to a Morgan Stanley survey. The survey revealed high iPhone upgrade intention rates and strong adoption of Apple Intelligence, suggesting continued demand for Apple products. Apple is trying to diversify its supply chain away from China and even went so far as to airlift 600 tons of iPhones from India to the U.S. However, analysts remain cautious about Apple's stock due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.
