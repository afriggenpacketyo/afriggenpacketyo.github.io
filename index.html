          <p>South Koreans are participating in a snap election to select a new president following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative leader who faced rebellion charges related to his imposition of martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest a likely win for Yoon's liberal rival, Lee Jae-myung, amidst public dissatisfaction with conservatives after Yoon's actions. Lee has emphasized patience regarding Trump's tariff policies, while Kim has expressed a desire to meet with Trump promptly, and the winning candidate will immediately assume office for a five-year term, facing challenges such as a slowing economy and strained relations with North Korea. Lee has also acknowledged the difficulties in achieving a summit with Kim Jong Un soon, expressing support for restarting talks with Kim Jong Un, potentially involving South Korea in North Korean projects. Optimism surrounding the political climate is tempered by the potential for continued domestic divisions.</p>

          <p>A former health teacher at IDEA Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., Devonne Keith Brown, has been arrested by the FBI on charges of soliciting child pornography from a minor. Brown allegedly used CashApp to send payments to the minor for sexually explicit photos, with the minor stating she met a man named "Joseph" who requested nude images. Authorities also found sexually graphic images and videos in emails sent to Brown by minors, and the charter school has stated that Brown is no longer employed and they are cooperating with law enforcement, emphasizing the safety and well-being of students. The school also stated that there is no indication that any IDEA student was directly involved in the case, and the investigation is ongoing. The incident raises serious concerns about the safety of children and the potential for exploitation by individuals in positions of trust.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a 72-hour stay for Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, an 18-year-old Boston high school student arrested by ICE while on his way to volleyball practice. Gomes, who entered the U.S. on a student visa, is eligible for asylum, and his attorney argues he has no criminal history. ICE defends the arrest, stating Gomes was in the country illegally, but Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey expressed outrage, and protests erupted in Milford, Massachusetts, over his detention. The acting director of ICE acknowledged that Gomes was not the initial target, but was driving his father's vehicle, whose whereabouts are currently unknown. The situation highlights the complexities of immigration enforcement and the impact on individuals and communities.</p>

          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has reversed a ruling granting qualified immunity to LAPD officer Toni McBride in a lawsuit over a 2020 on-duty shooting. The court cited a precedent case, stating that continuing to shoot a suspect who appears incapacitated violates the Fourth Amendment, and the case will now proceed to trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. McBride's father, a director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, believes his daughter acted in self-defense, and this ruling is a twist in a lawsuit against LAPD officer Toni McBride over an on-duty shooting that occurred in April 2020. McBride, who was granted medical retirement from the police department late last year, killed Daniel Hernandez after he was in a car accident in South L.A.</p>

          <p>In Milwaukee, Demetric Scott has been charged with felonies for allegedly framing Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented immigrant he's accused of assaulting, by sending forged letters threatening to kill Donald Trump. The letters, mailed to Wisconsin officials and ICE, gained media attention and were highlighted by the White House, but were later revealed to be a hoax. Scott allegedly admitted to writing the letters to prevent Morales-Reyes from testifying against him in an armed robbery and aggravated battery case, and Morales-Reyes remains in ICE detention despite evidence that he could not have written the letters.

          <p>One of Big Bear's bald eaglets, Sunny, has successfully taken its first flight from the nest, while her sister, Gizmo, remains behind. The eaglets, born in March, are nearly 13 weeks old, which is prime time for fledging, and viewers of the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam have been anticipating this moment. Sunny's flight followed days of practice, and young eagles often return to the nest soon after their first flight. It is expected that both eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, before venturing off on their own in the fall.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. The Department of Education stated this decision aims to protect Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes, and this action marks a policy shift for the administration, which had previously announced the resumption of collection activities on student loans. The pause allows older borrowers more time to address their defaulted loans and avoid reductions in their Social Security checks, and more than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are currently in default, highlighting the potential impact of this policy change. This move provides a measure of relief to older Americans struggling with student debt.</p>

          <p>Grupo Firme had to cancel their appearance at La Onda festival due to visa issues, joining a growing list of international musical acts, particularly música Mexicana artists, facing similar challenges since President Trump's second term began. This cancellation followed Julión Álvarez's postponed show in Texas due to his work visa being revoked, and the cancellation of Chicago's Michelada Fest over artist visa concerns. The U.S. State Department also canceled the visas of the band Los Alegres del Barranco after they displayed photos of a drug lord at a concert, and the article underscores the difficulties international artists face in obtaining visas under the current administration. These visa issues have caused significant disruptions and financial losses for artists and event organizers.</p>

          <p>Following a Molotov cocktail attack on Jewish Americans in Boulder, Colorado, the Jewish community is experiencing heightened fear and concern. The attack, where the suspect shouted “Free Palestine!”, is part of a broader surge in antisemitic violence, with anti-Jewish hate crimes reaching record levels in recent years. This violence has led to increased security measures at Jewish centers and temples, and some Jewish individuals are removing or concealing religious symbols out of fear. The rise in antisemitic incidents is attributed to various factors, including the Israel-Hamas war and the spread of hate speech online, and community leaders are calling for greater commitment to the safety of the Jewish community.</p>

The national anti-terror prosecutors are taking over the investigation, citing the suspect's intent to "disrupt public order through terror", and this incident is raising concerns about hate crimes and racism in France.

The pardons erase these convictions, and the divers' attorney argues that the case should never have been filed.
