          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has lowered its policy rate to a more than two-year low of 3.6% to stimulate the country's slowing economy. This decision was influenced by a substantial drop in inflation, which now sits near the bank's target range, providing room for monetary easing. The central bank also downgraded its full-year GDP forecast for 2025, citing uncertainties from the global trade environment, including U.S. tariffs, and weaker-than-expected domestic growth in the first quarter.

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to the App Store rankings of his AI chatbot, Grok. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to achieve top rankings, an issue he deems an "unequivocal antitrust violation." This legal threat escalates Musk's ongoing feud with OpenAI and adds to Apple's existing antitrust challenges, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <p>In a trial concerning the legality of President Trump's 2024 National Guard deployment in Los Angeles, a high-ranking general testified he never heard the protests described as a "rebellion." The lawsuit, filed by California's governor, questions whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military for law enforcement. The testimony challenges the administration's justification for using a law that permits presidential action during a "rebellion," adding a new layer to the ongoing legal and political dispute.</p>

Workers expressed frustration with the leadership's response and a sense of vulnerability, stating the attack was "shocking but not surprising." The shooter, who was killed during the incident, was reportedly an anti-vaccine advocate, and employees are calling for enhanced security measures and a stronger condemnation of the rhetoric they believe fueled the violence.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Peak Temperatures and Water Shortage Warnings Amid Heatwave</h2>

          <p>Much of England is under heat health alerts as temperatures are expected to peak, potentially reaching 34°C (93°F) in some southern and central areas. This heatwave is occurring while a national drought group warns that England is facing "nationally significant" water shortfalls. The combination of prolonged dry, hot weather is impacting crop yields, river wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. The heat is being driven by very warm air from continental Europe, where record-breaking temperatures have also been recorded.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Urges Trump to End Partisan Redistricting Efforts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 20:13:20 EDT</div>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has called on President Trump to halt a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas, warning of a retaliatory "redistricting arms race." With Texas Democrats blocking the plan by denying the legislature a quorum, Newsom stated California is prepared to redraw its own maps to create more Democratic-leaning seats to "neutralize" any Republican gains. The governor's letter to the president frames the issue as an "affront to American democracy" and a partisan power grab ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and has placed the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control, citing a need to address crime. The president invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act to enact the takeover, a move he called a "liberation day" for the capital. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the unprecedented action "unsettling," while noting that violent crime has actually been declining, contrary to the administration's claims, which appear to be based on outdated statistics.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is expanding "safe zones" around at least 100 schools in response to community fears over immigration raids. The announcement followed an incident where federal agents mistakenly detained a 15-year-old student at gunpoint outside a high school. In partnership with the mayor's office, the district will deploy staff and volunteers to create protective perimeters, aiming to reassure families that children will be safe traveling to and from school amid a heightened climate of fear.</p>

          <p>In the canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City, scientists are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to track the critically endangered axolotl. With the salamander now nearly impossible to find visually, researchers are filtering water to detect genetic traces left by the creatures. This modern technique allows them to monitor the dwindling population, which has plummeted from thousands per square kilometer to just a few dozen. The work aims to guide conservation efforts and highlights how protecting the axolotl's habitat also improves water quality for the entire region.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Federal Takeover of D.C. Police Criticized as Authoritarian Power Grab</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 19:23:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis piece from The Atlantic frames President Trump's federalization of the D.C. police and deployment of the National Guard as a politically motivated power grab, not a genuine crime-fighting measure. The article argues the move is based on misleading and outdated crime statistics and serves as a "PR stunt" to distract from other issues. It criticizes the action as an authoritarian precedent, using the military as a prop against the will of an elected local government, and draws parallels to anti-democratic actions by leaders like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele.</p>
