The Dragon spacecraft is crucial as the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, but SpaceX has been developing a replacement.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the public feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, describing it as an inevitable clash of egos with potentially damaging consequences for both parties. It suggests that while the spectacle is entertaining, it highlights a societal tendency toward abstraction and obfuscation, distracting from important policy issues. The author argues that their constant provocations and attention-seeking have downstream effects, creating content for others to draft off of, but ultimately prevents society from deciding who we are, both individually and collectively. The feud exemplifies the internet's culture of continuous conflict, where the underlying issues are often overshadowed by the spectacle.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed an amended complaint arguing that the Trump administration's ban on foreign students with F and J visas is unconstitutional. The university argues that the ban, affecting over 7,000 students, is a "government vendetta" in retaliation for Harvard's refusal to comply with demands including ideological screening and viewpoint diversity quotas. Harvard claims the administration is using the proclamation to circumvent previous court decisions, while the Department of Homeland Security defends the measure as restoring common sense to the student visa system.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's proclamation that sought to bar Harvard University's international students from entering the country. Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating the policy risks causing "immediate and irreparable injury." Harvard refiled a lawsuit to block the proclamation, arguing it violates the First Amendment and misuses federal law, calling it a "government vendetta" rather than a national security measure. The proclamation also directed the secretary of state to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard.</p>

The plaintiffs argue that the cost estimator software used by the insurers is flawed, leading to inadequate coverage.

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. In many states, this time doesn't count toward their ultimate sentence, extending their confinement and increasing costs. Experts argue that this practice undermines the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile system and violates fundamental rights. The article highlights the negative impact of detention on young people and calls for reforms to ensure fair treatment and access to services.</p>
