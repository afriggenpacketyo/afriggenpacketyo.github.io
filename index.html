        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican senators, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, are raising concerns about President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to its potential impact on the national debt, which has reached nearly $37 trillion. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by over $1.5 trillion against current baseline spending, the Congressional Budget Office estimates it could add about $3.1 trillion to the debt. Senators are pushing for steeper cuts, potentially affecting social safety net programs, while the White House defends the bill, citing its own analysis that projects $1.6 trillion in savings over 10 years. The Senate is expected to modify the House-passed proposal, and any changes must be approved by the House. Optimism about the bill's passage remains uncertain as some Republicans threaten to block it without modifications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia escalate attacks and engage in a second round of negotiations, the Trump administration is signaling a shift in its approach toward mediating the conflict by taking a less prominent role. President Trump has not publicly reacted to Ukraine's recent drone strikes inside Russia, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio played a smaller role in the latest talks. U.S. officials expressed disappointment with Russia's demands for a 30-day truce, viewing them as nonstarters. Despite the lack of progress in negotiations, attacks from both sides have intensified, with Ukraine claiming to have damaged a significant portion of Russia's strategic bomber fleet and Russia deploying a record number of drones and missiles against Ukraine. The situation remains tense, with both sides continuing to fight. </p>

          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election, intended to be a key component of the ruling party's societal transformation, saw a turnout of less than 13% of eligible voters. Despite President Claudia Sheinbaum's enthusiastic praise of the election as "extraordinary" and a "great success," the low participation rate has raised concerns about its legitimacy. Experts attribute the lack of participation to various factors, including the election being held off-year, the novelty and complexity of the balloting process, and the obscurity of the vast majority of candidates. Opponents have seized on the low turnout to mock the ruling party's electoral prowess and question the future independence of the judiciary. It is expected that the election results will reinforce the ruling party's power over all three branches of government.</p>

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's remarks at a town hall regarding potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to a constituent's concern about potential deaths resulting from Republican Medicaid cuts by stating, "Well, we're all going to die," and later sarcastically apologized in a cemetery. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current professional baseball player, aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy, particularly its impact on Iowa soybean farmers. Democrats have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, making this a challenging but significant political contest. </p>

          <p>Following recent solar storms, the northern lights may be visible in several U.S. states, including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and others as far south as New York and Pennsylvania. The sun's current maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle is contributing to more frequent and widespread light displays. A coronal mass ejection prompted forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert, with another potential aurora-producing event headed toward Earth. While severe storms can disrupt radio and GPS communications, the phenomenon offers a chance for skygazers to witness the colorful auroras, which are commonly visible near the poles, by venturing to quiet, dark areas away from city lights. </p>

The DOE will investigate institutions allegedly allowing males into female-only spaces, including the University of Wyoming and Jefferson County Public Schools in Colorado. The move signals a strong stance on protecting women's sports and intimate spaces, with Secretary of Education Linda McMahon vowing to fight on every front to uphold these rights. </p>

          <p>A recent study by Johns Hopkins University indicates a decline in childhood measles vaccination rates across the United States since before the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant variations within states. The MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year in 33 states, with 78% of counties experiencing a decline. The study highlights the need for targeted vaccination strategies to address these disparities, especially as the country faces its largest measles outbreak since 2019. The CDC reports that 96% of reported cases are among unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status, underscoring the importance of achieving herd immunity through widespread vaccination. </p>

Despite these challenges, Congress has shown limited pushback, reflecting a long-term trend of legislative fecklessness and deference to the executive branch.

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. This ruling limits the administration's practice of rapidly deporting individuals accused of gang membership under the 1798 law. The judge determined that the government has not provided sufficient notice for migrants to challenge their deportation, though he acknowledged the president's authority to decide whether an invasion or predatory incursion has occurred. This decision adds to the complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in other states reaching different conclusions. </p>

The Kremlin tasked a fugitive financier, recruited by Russian intelligence, to kill Grozev, leading to a multiyear, multicountry operation. While six individuals were sentenced to prison in London for their involvement, the broader campaign to silence Grozev highlights the extent of the Kremlin's efforts to suppress dissent. The story serves as a reminder of the dangers faced by those who speak truth to power and the importance of resisting unchecked, murderous authority. </p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following months of political turmoil, with the opposition's Lee Jae-myung emerging as the frontrunner. Lee, from the Democratic Party, faces ongoing legal cases and investigations for corruption, but his party already holds a parliamentary majority. His main opponent is Kim Moon Soo, from the conservative People Power Party, who has sought to distance himself from the impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol. The election is a significant step toward stabilizing the country, but the new leader will face daunting challenges both at home and abroad. </p>

          <p>Despite a turnout of less than 13%, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has called the country's judicial election 'extraordinary.' The election, intended to overhaul the judicial system, saw limited participation, which experts attribute to its off-year timing, complex process, and the obscurity of candidates. Opponents have criticized the low turnout, but the ruling party is expected to maintain control over the judiciary. The election's outcome is likely to consolidate power further in the presidency, potentially impacting the balance of power in Mexico. </p>
