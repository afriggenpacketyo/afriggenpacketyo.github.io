          <p>Following Israeli military strikes in Iran, the Chinese embassy in Tehran has issued a warning to Chinese citizens and businesses in the country. The embassy described the security situation as "severe and complicated" and advised its citizens to closely monitor the situation, enhance their safety awareness, and strengthen security measures. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel conducted strikes on nuclear targets in Iran, with the operation expected to continue for several days. The United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the United States was not involved in the strikes. The embassy's warning reflects growing concerns over regional instability. The optimism score reflects the inherent caution and concern prompted by escalating regional tensions. </p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel's military conducted airstrikes on Iran, targeting its nuclear facilities and research scientists in an operation dubbed "Operation Rising Lion." Netanyahu stated the strikes would continue until the Iranian nuclear threat is removed, while U.S. sources, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirmed that the United States was not involved in the operation. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson said the military launched a preemptive offensive based on intelligence to strike Iran's nuclear program in response to Iranian aggression. Iranian state media reported explosions and casualties in Tehran and Natanz, where a uranium enrichment facility is located, and the strikes come amidst ongoing efforts to negotiate an agreement with Iran to limit its nuclear program. The optimism score reflects the severe nature of the conflict and the potential for further escalation. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard to Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles. Breyer stated that Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he called the California National Guard into federal service, violating the Tenth Amendment. Newsom expressed gratitude for the decision, calling it a victory for the Constitution and democracy, however, the Justice Department swiftly notified the court it is appealing the order. The optimism score reflects the positive outcome for state authority but also acknowledges the ongoing legal battle. </p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary ruling against President Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with the state of California's argument that the president erred in how the guard was being activated. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom by noon Friday (Pacific Time), though the ruling could still be appealed. Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts do not have authority to review a president's decision on whether the National Guard is needed. Newsom had said that Trump's use of the military was unlawful, adding that the federal government is turning the military against American citizens. The optimism score reflects the legal challenge to federal power, but acknowledges the possibility of an appeal. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, according to archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were eating humans’ cooked foods and waste. This suggests the domestication process of Sus scrofa occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. The conventional view is that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The optimism score reflects the positive contribution to our understanding of history. </p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has begun, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining sluggish. As no party holds a majority in the 127-member assembly, all eyes are on whether Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats. Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, especially those unaffiliated. Major issues at stake include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals, child-rearing, and measures against heat. The optimism score reflects the anticipation of political change and the focus on key issues. </p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing their overseas expansion despite ongoing trade tariffs, with production abroad being key to their long-term survival. Solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US are still subject to tariffs, leading Chinese firms to diversify their production base. About 80% of existing Chinese solar manufacturers’ overseas capacity is in Southeast Asia, while nearly 80% of their planned overseas capacity expansion is in the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe. This diversification is a response to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs. The optimism score reflects the resilience and adaptability of Chinese solar companies in the face of trade challenges. </p>

          <p>About 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike to protest what they call unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing store workers announced that members have voted overwhelmingly in favor, giving their leaders authority to call a strike. The workers' contracts expired March 2, and negotiations are scheduled to resume on June 25. Among the chief sticking points in the talks is staffing levels, with the union contending that a staffing shortage has hurt service and working conditions.

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings from former federal officials that it could be costly and increase the risk of catastrophic blazes. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts, which are now split among five agencies and two cabinet departments. Trump’s proposed budget calls for the creation of a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the US interior department. The order makes no mention of climate change, and organizations representing firefighters say it would be costly to restructure firefighting efforts.
