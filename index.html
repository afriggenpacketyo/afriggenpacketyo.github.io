            <p>The UK experienced warm and sunny weather, with temperatures reaching 23.2C in London, but failed to surpass the hottest day of the year recorded earlier in April. Fire services are warning of increased wildfire risks due to low rainfall. The forecast for the weekend includes sunshine and possible light rain, with temperatures expected to remain above average. The warmest April UK temperature on record was 29.4C in London in 1949, making this year still relatively mild compared to historical records.</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice missed a court-imposed deadline to inform a federal judge about its plan to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was wrongly deported.

The Supreme Court instructed the lower court to clarify the wording of its original order, and the judge has scheduled a hearing to address the matter.

            <p>The Trump administration eliminated the HHS office responsible for setting federal poverty guidelines, which determine eligibility for benefits for at least 80 million people. Former staff members claim no one else in the government knows how to calculate the guidelines. HHS defended the firings, stating that the department merged AHRQ and ASPE to streamline operations. Concerns are rising about potential cuts in assistance to low-income families if the positions are not restored or duties reassigned.</p>

            <p>A British man was surprised to find a photo of his tattoo in a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to identify alleged members of a Venezuelan criminal gang, Tren de Aragua (TdA). Pete Belton, who has no connection to the gang, expressed concern about a planned family trip to Miami. Lawyers argue that some deportees have been misidentified as gang members based on their tattoos. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of individuals it alleges to be members of TdA.</p>

            <p>The United States is experiencing the highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with over 700 infections confirmed in at least 24 states. A significant outbreak in West Texas has led to two deaths, primarily affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers. Health experts attribute the increase to lower vaccination rates. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voiced support for vaccination amid the outbreak, encouraging people to get the measles vaccine but opposing government mandates.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policies have raised concerns about the U.S. dollar's status as a safe haven currency. The dollar has fallen to its lowest level in three years, and investors are reassessing its attractiveness as a global reserve currency. The Trump crash has included US equities, government bonds, known as treasuries, and the dollar losing value in sync. The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy is undermining confidence in the dollar and potentially accelerating de-dollarization.</p>

Trump advocated for ending daylight saving time, citing its popularity and the desire to avoid changing clocks. This follows Trump's recent shift in tariff policy, implementing a 90-day pause for most countries while increasing tariffs on China.

            <p>The world's longest-lasting pig organ transplant has failed after the recipient's body rejected the genetically modified organ. Towana Looney, who received the pig kidney in November 2024, had the organ removed after 130 days. Despite the rejection, doctors emphasized the significant progress made in xenotransplantation research. Other patients have received genetically modified pig kidneys or hearts, but none survived as long as Looney. Researchers hope that pig organs may alleviate the organ shortage.</p>

            <p>Hector Carvajal, the founder of Don Carvajal Cafe, says that tariffs might push him to charge a minimum of 25% more per bag of coffee. He's one of many American business owners trying to walk the tightrope of increasing prices to help cover increased costs due to tariffs, while also attempting to avoid losing customers en masse. The founder sources his coffee beans from the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Brazil and Costa Rica, so they'll be subject to the 10% tax. Adjusting to changing trade policy takes time, energy and resources for small businesses to adapt.</p>

            <p>Gold prices are currently soaring due to fears of a global trade war and its potential to push the U.S. economy into recession. However, some analysts think gold prices may have peaked and are currently overbought. Experts often recommend getting investment exposure to gold through an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of physical gold. There is also the option of buying physical gold, or bullion, including bars and coins, which "is a financial insurance position, as opposed to part of your portfolio." (not investment advice)</p>
