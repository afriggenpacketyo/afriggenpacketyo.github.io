          <p>Liberty Steel is urgently attempting to prevent the closure of its Rotherham and Sheffield plants, which could result in 1,450 job losses.

          <p>President Trump's tax and spending bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is facing opposition from Republican dissidents in the House of Representatives. The bill's $4.9 trillion in tax breaks, partly funded by cuts to Medicaid and green energy incentives, have sparked concerns about the growing national debt. Disagreements also center on the extent of Medicaid cuts, with some lawmakers seeking immediate implementation of work requirements. Another point of contention is the proposed tripling of a local tax deduction, which is seen as insufficient by lawmakers from high-tax states.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved a 17th package of sanctions on Russia, aimed at intensifying economic pressure and pushing President Putin toward peace talks. The new measures target Russia's "shadow fleet" used for covert oil exports, with discussions already underway for an 18th package that could target gas pipelines and banks. Despite the extensive sanctions, Russia's economy has rebounded after an initial contraction, prompting questions about the effectiveness of the measures. While sanctions have impacted Russia's revenues and increased inflation, the country has adapted by finding new markets and evading restrictions.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, investors are considering adding the precious metal to their portfolios; however, it's important to manage risks strategically in today's volatile economic climate. Experts recommend limiting gold investments to a maximum of 10% of an overall portfolio, focusing on secure investment types like gold bars and coins rather than riskier options such as mining stocks. Monitoring the economic climate is also crucial to determine potential selling opportunities and ensure gold continues to serve as a reliable hedge against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly 2 million federal student loan borrowers who've requested to be in an affordable repayment plan are stuck in a backlog of applications, waiting to be approved or denied, according to new data recently shared by the U.S. Department of Education. In late March, the Trump administration made the online applications available again, and said that it pulled the forms because it needed to make sure all repayment plans complied with a court order that blocked the Biden administration's new IDR plan, known as SAVE, or the Saving on a Valuable Education plan. Without access to an affordable repayment plan, student loan borrowers can be suspended on their timeline to loan forgiveness and at risk of falling behind and facing collection activity.</p>

          <p>Nearly two million federal student loan borrowers are caught in a backlog of applications for affordable repayment plans, according to the U.S. Department of Education. This delay complicates matters as the Trump administration restarts collection activity, potentially leaving borrowers vulnerable to default. The Education Department estimates that approximately 10 million people could be in default on their student loans within months. Without access to an affordable repayment plan, borrowers risk falling behind and facing collection activity, impacting their timeline for loan forgiveness.</p>

          <p>Medical experts are discussing former President Biden's recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer, which had spread to his bones, raising questions about screening practices. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, but many men continue screening into their 70s. Some experts noted that aggressive cancers can develop even with regular screenings. The PSA test, while common, is not foolproof and can miss fast-growing cancers. The article highlights the complexities and limitations of prostate cancer screening and the potential risks of treatment for slow-growing cancers.</p>

          <p>President Trump appears to be stepping back from his diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, disappointing many Ukrainians who view his approach as ineffective. While Trump's shift may reduce pressure on Ukraine to make concessions, it also signals a continuation of the devastating conflict. Many Ukrainians believe Russia is unwilling to negotiate unless forced, and they see Trump's diplomacy as a cover for intensified attacks. Despite the challenges, Ukrainians remain determined to defend their country, with increased support from European allies and growing domestic weapons production.</p>

The legislation removes exemptions for confession in reporting mandates, potentially altering the practice of confession within the Catholic Church and drawing concerns from religious freedom advocates.</p>
