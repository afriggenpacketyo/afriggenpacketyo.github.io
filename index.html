          <p>A surprising bipartisan coalition in the House defied Republican leadership, voting against a rule that would have blocked proxy voting for new parent lawmakers.  Nine Republicans joined Democrats, creating a temporary House paralysis.  The vote centered on a discharge petition by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, seeking to allow proxy voting for parents within 12 weeks postpartum. House GOP leaders subsequently canceled votes for the week.</p>
