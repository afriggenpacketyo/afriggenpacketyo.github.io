            <p>President Trump's imposition of 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, excluding certain technology hardware like iPhones, is predicted to inflict 'irreversible' damage on many American businesses, particularly small businesses. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China as companies halt container exports. Industries like furniture, toys, apparel, and footwear are already experiencing a complete stop in orders from U.S. importers. Experts warn that these high tariffs will likely halt most trade between the U.S. and China, potentially leading to widespread product shortages and lost sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The welfare of resurrected animals is also a concern, as they lack kin and their natural habitats no longer exist. A study suggests that resources spent on de-extinction could save more species if directed towards conservation efforts.</p>

            <p>The US-China tariff war could end quickly once talks begin, as both sides are open to dialogue after escalating duties. President Trump raised levies on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting China to counter with tariffs totaling nearly 148%. Trump paused fresh tariffs for most trading partners, except China. Observers believe that a resolution is possible due to mutual willingness to negotiate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A bomb exploded in central Athens, damaging the offices of Greek railway company Hellenic Train, following anonymous warnings to media outlets.

            <p>Israel's defense minister has announced that the military will soon expand its offensive throughout most of Gaza. The IDF has completed the takeover of a 'security zone' in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, separating Rafah and Khan Younis. Israeli officials say the offensive aims to pressure Hamas into freeing the remaining hostages. Hamas said the offensive kills civilians and makes the fate of hostages 'uncertain.' The UN's human rights office warned that the evacuation orders fail to comply with international law.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the potentially devastating economic impact of Donald Trump's tariff policies, arguing that they could irreparably damage the U.S.'s global standing and economy. The author suggests that the first Trump administration’s flirtation with protectionism seems quaint in hindsight. The article suggests that there’s no coming back from this quickly. It suggests that the lack of Congressional oversight exacerbates the problem, and notes that markets are reacting negatively, questioning the safety of U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>

            <p>Amid the uncertainty of Trump's tariffs, Americans are adjusting their spending habits, stocking up on goods, postponing major purchases, and reconsidering their consumption patterns. Some consumers are stocking up on goods potentially hit by tariffs, while others are cutting back on unnecessary expenses and focusing on savings. The economic instability is causing some to delay or cancel planned purchases, while others are reconsidering their consumption patterns and prioritizing local and independent shops.</p>

            <p>US support for Ukraine has not slowed the provision of American weapons to Taiwan or Israel, but there are supply chain problems that need “prudent reforms and substantial new investments”, according to a Washington-based think tank. The Donald Trump administration has pledged a record US$1 trillion in defence spending for next year. The report’s authors, Ryan Brobst and Bradley Bowman, warned that US defence industrial bases had been damaged by insufficient spending and that Washington might not be able to sustain the supply of weapons to its partners without a major shift.</p>
