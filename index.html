        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has limited the grounds for mass compensation claims related to undisclosed commissions in car finance deals. The court rejected the idea that car dealers have a "fiduciary duty" to buyers, a ruling that prevents a potential flood of claims against lenders. However, it upheld one claim where the commission was deemed "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act, setting a precedent for cases with exceptionally large, undisclosed payments. Analysts believe a separate regulatory review could still result in billions in compensation payouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Washington Commanders' proposal to build a new stadium at the former RFK Stadium site has cleared a significant hurdle with a 9-3 D.C. Council vote. The plan, which includes a $3.7 billion redevelopment project with housing and retail space, requires one more approval before heading to the mayor's desk. This progress comes as former President Donald Trump has publicly pressured the team to revert to its previous "Redskins" nickname. Team owner Josh Harris has affirmed that the "Commanders" name will remain.</p>

Kugler, a Biden nominee whose term was set to expire in 2026, will return to a professorship at Georgetown University.

          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling over 500 points and the Nasdaq shedding over 2%. The decline was driven by a weaker-than-expected jobs report, which showed only 73,000 jobs added in July, alongside downward revisions for the previous two months. Investor sentiment was further dampened by the White House's announcement of new tariffs on over 60 countries, creating fresh uncertainty for global trade and increasing expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released a surprisingly weak jobs report. In a social media post, Trump accused McEntarfer, a Biden appointee, of manipulating data to make him look bad. The report showed a gain of only 73,000 jobs in July and included major downward revisions for the prior two months, contributing to a sharp stock market drop. The move was swiftly criticized by McEntarfer's predecessor as a dangerous, groundless attack on the integrity of the federal statistical system.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been moved from a low-security facility in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. The transfer occurred shortly after she met with a top Justice Department official to discuss the Epstein case, though no official reason for the move was provided. The new facility has fewer security features, such as perimeter fencing, and a lower staff-to-inmate ratio.

Furthermore, with inflation readings difficult to parse and strong stock market performance potentially reducing demand for safe-haven assets, the immediate direction for gold is unclear.

This "safe country" concept is central to the Italy-Albania deal, which aimed to fast-track applications.

This analysis argues that the weak data, combined with rising inflation, aligns with the stagflationary environment economists had originally predicted would result from the administration's trade policies.

          <p>Indian fast bowler Prasidh Krishna revealed that a heated on-field exchange with England's Joe Root during the fifth Test was a deliberate tactic to disrupt the star batter. While the exact words were not audible, Root's animated reaction was unusual. Krishna, who took four wickets, described the incident as competitive banter between two players who are friends off the field. The tense moment was part of a series marked by several confrontations, reflecting the high stakes as India seeks to level the series, which England currently leads 2-1.</p>

          <p>Walt Disney Co. is reportedly set to announce a deal giving the NFL an equity stake in its sports media giant, ESPN. In exchange, ESPN is expected to take over the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership would deepen the financial ties between the league and one of its largest broadcast partners ahead of future media rights negotiations. The move comes as ESPN adapts to the decline of traditional cable TV by launching a direct-to-consumer streaming service to better compete in the evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>A debate has been reignited in Germany over whether to raise the retirement age beyond 67 to sustain the country's pension system. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche argued for working longer to counter the demographic reality of an aging population, where the ratio of workers to pensioners is rapidly declining. The proposal faced immediate backlash from political opponents and trade unions, who argue it would effectively be a pension cut for those in physically demanding jobs unable to work longer. The discussion highlights the urgent need for reform as Germany's pension fund faces increasing financial pressure.</p>

The craft will be based on Joby's S4 design but will use a gas turbine, a departure from Joby's all-electric commercial air taxis.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized physical education assessment that was a staple in American schools for over 50 years until it was phased out in 2013. The order aims to address declining physical fitness and rising obesity rates among children, which it frames as a threat to national vitality. The revived program will also reinstate the Presidential Fitness Award for top-performing students. Educators express cautious optimism, hoping the new test will focus on overall health rather than just athletic performance.</p>
