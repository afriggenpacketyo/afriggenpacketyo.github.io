          <p>Six men, including a possible teenager, were found dead at the Prospect Valley Dairy farm in Northern Colorado. Emergency crews responded to a confined space rescue call and discovered the victims. Preliminary findings from the Weld County Coroner's Office suggest the cause of death was exposure to a toxic gas. The Weld County Sheriff's Office has stated that no criminal activity is suspected, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is now conducting a federal investigation into the tragic workplace incident.</p>

Authorities report a car bomb exploded in the city of Cali, killing six and injuring over 60, while a drone attack on a police helicopter near Medellin killed 12 officers. Dissident factions of the former FARC guerrilla group are blamed for the violence, which poses a significant challenge to the nation's peace process. In response, the government has convened a security council to implement additional protection measures for its citizens.</p>

          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who, along with his brother Lyle, was convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. After a lengthy hearing, the panel determined that Menendez still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety, citing numerous prison rule violations as a primary factor. The commissioners acknowledged the claims of abuse the brothers have long maintained but concluded that other options were available besides murder. Menendez will be eligible for another parole hearing in three years.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are choosing to include their pet dogs in their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral family members. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, "flower girls," and greeters, bringing a unique sense of joy and comfort to the special day. To meet this demand, specialized dog chaperone services have emerged to manage the pets, ensuring they are well-cared for and prepared for their roles. This trend reflects a broader societal shift where pets are increasingly viewed as cherished members of the family, akin to children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its component suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics, to pause production of its H20 artificial intelligence chip. This move follows reports that the Chinese government told local tech companies to stop purchasing the chip due to national security concerns, specifically regarding potential tracking technology or "backdoors." The development complicates Nvidia's efforts to navigate the complex trade relationship between the U.S. and China, especially after Washington had approved export licenses for the H20 chip. Nvidia has stated it is managing its supply chain to address market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A court filing from the legal dispute between Elon Musk and OpenAI has revealed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to participate in a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the AI company in early 2025. The proposal was made when Musk, through his company xAI, was attempting to form an investor consortium to take over OpenAI, which he co-founded as a non-profit. According to the filing, neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent or invested in the bid. This information surfaced as part of OpenAI's counterclaims against Musk in their ongoing lawsuit.</p>

The "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the Bank of Japan, remained steady at 3.4%. This data comes as the central bank continues to face pressure regarding its monetary policy, with inflation remaining above its 2% target for the 40th consecutive month. (not investment advice)</p>

The injunction prohibits any new detainees from being brought to the site and mandates the removal of all camp infrastructure after the 60-day period.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in her dissent, described the outcome as "Calvinball jurisprudence," arguing it creates arbitrary rules that make it difficult to challenge government actions and ensures the administration prevails.</p>

          <p>Families who lost babies under the care of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust have stated they feel "ignored and dismissed" after a meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national review into maternity services. The group, which has been campaigning for an independent inquiry led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden, claimed the meeting made no progress and that the chair was unprepared. Their frustration was compounded by the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, which they believe compromises the investigation's independence and ability to hold the system accountable for failures in care.</p>

          <p>The online message board 4chan has declared it will refuse to pay fines proposed by the UK's media regulator, Ofcom, under the new Online Safety Act. A lawyer for the site stated that Ofcom has provisionally decided to impose a £20,000 fine with daily penalties for failing to provide information for an investigation. The lawyer argued that as a U.S.-based company, 4chan is protected by the First Amendment and that UK laws create no legal obligations in the United States. This standoff highlights the growing international conflict over the regulation of U.S. tech firms and the extraterritorial reach of national laws.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to hold a special election in November, where voters will decide on a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps to favor Democrats. The move is a direct response to a similar partisan gerrymandering effort by Republicans in Texas, with Newsom stating California is "neutralizing" the Texas map. If approved by voters, the new boundaries could flip up to five Republican-held House seats to Democrats. The action has been criticized by Republicans as a "Gavinmander," but Democrats argue it is a necessary step to counter a power grab.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content in their products. The guidance also calls for an end to the promotion of snack foods for babies under one year old and restricts the use of unsubstantiated health claims on packaging. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the new recommendations, with the government stating it will consider "alternative measures" if the industry fails to make sufficient changes.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., stated he was puzzled by the company's stock drop following what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. Despite Walmart raising its full-year sales and earnings forecast, its stock fell by 4.5%, becoming the Dow's biggest loser for the day. Simon highlighted the company's growing sales, expanding margins, and ability to manage tariffs as signs of robust health. He suggested investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss driven by non-systemic issues like restructuring costs, arguing the company's fundamentals remain very strong.

The vehicle is designed to be larger, with more cargo space and a technology-rich interior, as the brand aims to reclaim its position in the competitive midsize SUV market.

          <p>The global race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying. China and Russia are considered the leaders in this field, having invested heavily in the technology for years, while the U.S. and other Western nations are now working to catch up. These weapons pose a significant strategic threat because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. The proliferation of this technology is altering military calculations and raising concerns about a new era of geopolitical competition.</p>

          <p>American midfielder Dante Polvara came off the bench to score a crucial goal and inspire a comeback for Aberdeen in their Europa League play-off match against FCSB. After falling behind 2-0, Aberdeen rallied to a 2-2 draw after Polvara's introduction, with his impressive goal just three minutes after entering the game shifting the momentum. The fan-favorite player, who has been used sparingly this season by manager Jimmy Thelin, delivered a dynamic performance that has increased calls for him to be given a starting role. His cameo highlighted his value to the team ahead of the second leg in Bucharest.</p>
