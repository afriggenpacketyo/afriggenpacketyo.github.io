Human forecasters translate the computer outputs into understandable forecasts for various media. The article also touches on concerns about potential disruptions to weather monitoring due to staffing shortages and budget cuts, which could impact the accuracy and detail of forecasts.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached a deal to reset their relationship after Britain's exit from the bloc in 2020. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. Both sides have agreed to work toward a deal that would make it easier for young people to live and work across the continent through a "balanced youth experience" scheme.

The author argues that by entering into these agreements, the law firms have become subsidiaries of the administration, subject to the president's demands. The firms may be forced to argue for policy positions they detest, as the president is aware that many lawyers at these firms lean liberal and contribute to Democratic candidates. The author concludes that the firms have lost their independence and are now vulnerable to the president's control.</p>

          <p>Recent studies have shown that a vegan diet can be just as effective as a meat-based diet for building muscle through strength training. While it was previously believed that animal-based protein was superior for muscle protein synthesis, new research indicates that plant-based protein can be comparable if consumed in sufficient quantities and as part of a balanced diet. The article highlights a trial comparing vegan and omnivore diets, which found that both offered the same muscle-building potential. The importance of consuming a variety of plant-based foods to ensure adequate intake of essential amino acids is also emphasized.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is experiencing a mass exodus of attorneys as the Trump administration redirects its focus to enforcing the president's executive orders. Approximately 70% of the division's lawyers have left or will leave, marking a significant shift from its traditional mission of combating discrimination and protecting constitutional rights. The administration is prioritizing issues such as ending alleged radical indoctrination in schools and combating anti-Christian bias. This has led to concerns that the division is being weaponized against the populations it is supposed to protect.</p>

          <p>Verizon has ended its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies to gain the FCC's approval for its $20 billion deal to buy Frontier Communications. The company is removing DEI references from training materials and websites, ending bonuses tied to diversity goals, and dissolving its DEI-focused HR department. This move follows a trend of companies abandoning DEI efforts under pressure from the Trump administration, which has declared war on such initiatives. The FCC has been actively investigating companies like Comcast and Disney over concerns about DEI discrimination.</p>

The industry is preparing its workers for potential encounters with immigration officials and emphasizing the importance of legal compliance.</p>

Although economic growth slowed slightly in April compared to the first quarter, it remained robust, with industrial output, retail sales, and exports exceeding market expectations.</p>
