        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its broader restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's announcement earlier in the week that it would shut down seven vehicle plants and reduce its global workforce by 20,000 jobs after experiencing a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The potential closures involve Nissan's main Oppama plant, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co., a builder of commercial vehicles, together these plants represent approximately 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The company has yet to engage in discussions with labor unions, parts makers, and local municipalities, making the closures uncertain.</p>

          <p>Republicans, led by House Oversight Committee Chairman, are raising concerns about Joe Biden's cognitive abilities and his authorization of aides to use an autopen for signing official documents. The concerns stem from the release of audio from Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, which reveals Biden slurring words, muttering, and experiencing memory lapses, including failing to recall the date of his son Beau's death or the year Trump was first elected. Comer has announced a new investigation into who authorized the autopen's use, especially concerning presidential pardons, raising questions about the validity of actions taken under Biden's authority.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura concluded her four days of testimony in the criminal trial of Sean Combs, providing detailed accounts of their tumultuous relationship marked by violence, drug use, and power imbalances. Ventura, who signed with Combs' label at 19, testified that he subjected her to physical abuse and coerced her into drug-fueled sexual performances with male escorts, which she described as becoming "like a job." Defense attorneys attempted to portray Ventura as a willing participant, but Ventura stated she was acting under Combs' instructions and felt trapped in the relationship. Ventura testified that she received a $20 million settlement from her civil lawsuit against Combs, but said she would give the money back to undo the harm she suffered.</p>

Comey removed the post after the backlash, claiming he was unaware of the violent connotations some associated with the numbers.

This release follows a February 2024 report in which Special Counsel Robert Hur described Biden as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."

The dust storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, significantly reduced visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports.

Goldberg argues that the party's tendency towards groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion led to a collective failure to recognize and address Biden's obvious infirmity. The article suggests that while Biden's inner circle attempted to shield him, his decline was evident to many, yet party leaders and insiders remained unwilling to acknowledge the problem. The author calls for a reckoning within the Democratic Party to learn from these mistakes and regain credibility with voters.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post. Comey's Instagram post, featuring seashells arranged to spell the numbers 8647, was interpreted by Trump supporters as a call to assassinate the president, prompting a Secret Service investigation. Comey has stated that it "never occurred to me" that the numbers represented a coded threat and removed the post hours after it drew attention from Trump administration officials and supporters. The number 86 is common slang for stopping or getting rid of something, and the number 47 could be understood to indicate Trump, the 47th president.</p>

The downgrade, one notch below the highest triple-A rating, reflects concerns about the government's ability to address its growing debt burden, which now exceeds $36 trillion. Moody's pointed to the failure of successive administrations and Congress to curtail U.S. debt or address long-term financial challenges, such as the rising costs of Social Security and Medicare. The downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and the government, though past downgrades have had limited impact.</p>

          <p>The United States has lost its last perfect credit rating as Moody's downgraded the nation's rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', citing concerns over the government's ability to repay its debt due to ballooning deficits and interest costs. Moody's expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year. The White House responded by blaming the previous administration for the fiscal situation. The downgrade coincides with a setback in Congress for a landmark spending bill proposed by the current administration.</p>

          <p>An internal review has revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season, citing staff cuts and a push by President Trump to eliminate the agency.

The document references Mr. Trump's plan to shift more emergency response duties to the states, suggesting the federal agency should offer "supplemental assistance" in some cases.
