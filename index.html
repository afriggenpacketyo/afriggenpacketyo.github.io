          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating inter-bank lending rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. They were jailed years ago as part of a global scandal surrounding the Libor and Euribor rates, which influence borrowing costs for mortgages and loans. The men argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what was then normal commercial practice to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis, and this ruling marks a significant vindication after a ten-year fight. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that Canada will not agree to unfavorable terms simply to avoid new U.S. tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump. With a looming August 1st deadline, the U.S. plans to impose a 35% tax on Canadian goods if no agreement is reached. This standoff is part of a broader U.S. protectionist strategy that has disrupted the global economy, with Canada already facing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Carney indicated Canada is prepared to implement countermeasures to protect its key industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>AI Startups Attract Massive Investment, But Profitable Exits Remain Scarce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 06:15:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of the year, AI startups in the U.S. raised a staggering $104.3 billion, nearly matching the total for all of 2024, with giants like OpenAI and Anthropic leading the charge. Despite this influx of capital, the market for venture capital exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized from 281 deals. This disparity indicates that while investor appetite for AI is robust, profitable returns are lagging, characterized by frequent but lower-value acquisitions rather than high-value public offerings. Analysts suggest this trend may continue until macroeconomic conditions improve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered by a schoolboy on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a storied past. Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that served during the American War of Independence, it was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship in the Arctic. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a significant community effort by the island's 500 residents. The ship, which wrecked in 1788 with all crew surviving, is now being preserved as a link to the island's rich maritime history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has cultivated a near-monopoly on the refining of rare earth elements, which are critical for everything from smartphones to advanced defense systems. This dominance was achieved over decades by undercutting U.S. producers, enduring severe environmental costs, and eventually consolidating hundreds of small, unregulated mines into six state-controlled giants. This strategic control allows Beijing to influence global supply and prices, a power it has wielded in trade disputes with the U.S. Now, American companies are attempting to re-enter the industry to reduce reliance on China, spurred by recent Chinese export restrictions that highlighted supply chain vulnerabilities.</p>

Woldbye stated that despite his absence, the airport's crisis management procedures functioned correctly.

          <p>A new study from Peking University People's Hospital suggests that weight lost while using anti-obesity medications, such as GLP-1 drugs, is often regained after treatment stops. The research, published in BMC Medicine, found that patients saw "significant weight" return just eight weeks after ceasing the medications, with the regain continuing over a 20-week period. The findings underscore a common challenge in weight-loss strategies and highlight the potential need for long-term treatment protocols to maintain results. The study emphasizes that weight management may require ongoing intervention rather than a short-term fix.</p>

The timing is critical, as the hearing coincides with rising inflation and threats of new tariffs on numerous trading partners. The plaintiffs argue that President Trump misused the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and that the tariffs violate the "major questions doctrine" by enacting policy of vast economic significance without clear congressional approval.

Reproductive psychiatrists expressed concern that the panel ignored the significant risks of untreated maternal depression and could spread misinformation that prevents pregnant women from receiving necessary care.

          <p>The son of an elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who were detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan five months ago, fears they could die in prison due to their declining health. The couple, aged 80 and 76, were arrested for unknown reasons and have been held in harsh conditions, including a maximum-security prison, despite facing no charges. Their son reports his father is suffering from serious convulsions while his mother is numb from malnutrition. The UN has called their detention "inhumane," and the family is pleading for their immediate release and access to medical care.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a major trade agreement with Japan, which includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. As part of the deal, U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles and auto parts will be reduced from a threatened 25% to 15%, a move welcomed by Japan's Prime Minister. The agreement also reportedly opens Japan's market to some U.S. agricultural products. While touted as a major success by the administration, U.S. automakers have criticized the deal for giving Japanese imports a tariff advantage over parts from Canada and Mexico.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing significant protests after signing a controversial bill that brings the country's independent anti-corruption bodies under the control of the Prosecutor General's Office. Critics, including Transparency International and the European Commission, warn this move undermines Ukraine's anti-corruption reforms and could threaten its path to EU membership. Zelenskyy has defended the law as necessary to cleanse the agencies of Russian influence and ensure justice. The legislation has sparked demonstrations in Kyiv and other cities, with opponents fearing a slide towards authoritarianism.</p>

The new directives require USDA funding recipients to disclose foreign contracts and certify they are not part of "malign foreign talent recruitment programs." The policy has already resulted in the dismissal of 70 noncitizen researchers. While the USDA frames this as a necessary security action, critics and scientists warn that it could stifle vital international collaboration and hinder American innovation in agricultural science.</p>

The new system is a key part of China's "dual circulation" strategy to boost domestic consumption and could serve as a buffer in the trade war with the U.S. Goods with sufficient value-added processing in Hainan will also be able to be sold tariff-free to the rest of mainland China.

The judge in the case discovered the fabrications after using ChatGPT to verify a citation, finding that many of the referenced cases did not exist in any legal database. The incident, which is not isolated in the country, led the judge to rule against the plaintiff and criticize the lawyers for their "laziness" in failing to check the AI-generated research.

          <p>Germany is experiencing a boom in its "shadow economy," with undeclared work projected to reach €511 billion in 2025, representing over 11% of the country's total economic output. An expert who studies the phenomenon attributes the surge to a growing public perception of paying high taxes for poor-quality state services, such as unreliable trains and crumbling infrastructure. This "tax rebellion of the common man" is also fueled by a struggling official economy and a debate over social welfare benefits, which critics argue may disincentivize legal, low-paid work. The trend highlights a growing disconnect between citizens and the state. (not investment advice)</p>
