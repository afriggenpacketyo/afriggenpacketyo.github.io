          <p>A manhunt is ongoing for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider him armed and dangerous, offering a reward for information leading to his arrest as they search the rugged terrain he is familiar with. The small, tight-knit community is mourning the victims, who were regulars at the bar and known by the suspect, whose family says he has struggled with mental illness for years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is launching a 12-month pilot program requiring some business and leisure travelers to post bonds of up to $15,000 to enter the country. The policy targets visitors from nations with high visa overstay rates or inadequate security screening, with the State Department set to announce the specific countries affected. Officials expect only about 2,000 people to be impacted during the pilot, which aims to test the feasibility of the bond system and encourage foreign governments to reduce overstay rates.

          <p>Nations are meeting at a UN conference in Geneva to resume negotiations for a legally binding global treaty aimed at curbing plastic pollution. With plastic production soaring and an estimated 200 trillion pieces in the world's oceans, the talks are stalled over key issues like production caps and chemical bans. While nearly 100 countries support an ambitious treaty, oil-producing nations are pushing back, advocating for a focus on recycling rather than production limits, creating a critical impasse in addressing the environmental and health crisis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that Poland is sliding back towards right-wing populism less than two years after a coalition led by Donald Tusk ousted the Law and Justice party. The initial enthusiasm has faded due to unfulfilled promises, a failure to liberalize abortion laws, and adopting nationalist rhetoric, leading to a slump in Tusk's popularity. This trend reflects a broader pattern where post-populist governments struggle to enact change and offer a compelling future vision, risking a return to populist rule.</p>

          <p>Recent social media footage has revealed what appears to be China's next-generation early warning and control aircraft, designated the KJ-3000. The prototype is based on a modified Y-20B transport plane, distinguished by a large rotating radar dome, or rotodome, on its fuselage. Despite some militaries moving away from this type of aircraft for modern warfare, Beijing's development of the KJ-3000 signals a continued commitment to this airborne surveillance strategy, with the new design suggesting advanced capabilities.</p>

          <p>India has responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of higher tariffs by defending its increased imports of Russian oil. The country's foreign ministry stated it only began buying significant quantities of Russian oil after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe following the 2022 conflict, a move it claims the U.S. initially encouraged to stabilize global energy markets. India also highlighted that both the U.S. and EU continue to engage in substantial trade with Russia, framing the criticism as targeted and hypocritical. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Israeli media reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to pursue a full military occupation of the entire Gaza Strip. The move would involve expanding Israeli military operations across all parts of the enclave, a decision reportedly driven by the belief that Hamas will not release more captives without Israel's total surrender. This development comes amid intense international pressure for a ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid, as well as domestic pressure to secure the release of remaining captives.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest as he stands trial for allegedly plotting a coup. The judge cited Bolsonaro's failure to comply with previous restraining orders, including a ban on contacting allies, which he allegedly flouted during a recent rally. The order also prohibits him from receiving most visitors and using a phone, escalating the legal and political pressure on the former right-wing leader, who denies the allegations.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has confirmed he declined an invitation to serve on President Donald Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley, who was shocked to see his name mentioned, stated that he felt he would be too busy and that it was in his best interest not to accept the position. The NFL player has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, and he pushed back against criticism of those meetings by stating that he respects the office of the presidency.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and cavers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The survey also uncovered evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The finds are part of a larger project aimed at understanding the long history of farming and human interaction with the landscape, highlighting the crucial role that recreational cavers play in uncovering subterranean archaeological sites.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates that in the event of a full military blockade by China, Taiwan's natural gas reserves would be depleted in just 11 days. The analysis, based on 26 war-gaming scenarios, also found that coal supplies would last seven weeks and oil reserves 20 weeks, posing a critical vulnerability for the island. However, the report concludes that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict.

          <p>More than £100 million in prizes from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program have gone unclaimed, including 11 prizes of £100,000. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace winners, especially those who were gifted bonds or only have old paper records. NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of prizes since 1957 but acknowledges that older, non-digitized bonds are harder to trace, leaving millions in limbo during a cost-of-living crisis.

          <p>An American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has sparked a significant social media debate and drawn praise from President Donald Trump. The controversy centers on a line where the blue-eyed actress makes a pun on "genes" and "jeans," which some critics claimed echoed rhetoric associated with eugenics, while others dismissed the outrage as overblown. American Eagle defended the ad as being solely about its denim, and the company's stock surged after Trump, who noted Sweeney is a registered Republican, praised the campaign.

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has issued a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed fat and muscle tissue. Lab tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by diphacinone, a common anticoagulant rodenticide, which the pigs likely consumed directly or by eating other poisoned animals. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use bait stations inaccessible to non-target wildlife and advising hunters to avoid consuming any game that appears discolored or abnormal.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This trend is directly linked to a 62% rise in screenings within this age group from 2019 to 2023, following updated recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45. While researchers celebrate this as promising news for early detection, they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and are not increasing equitably across all demographics.</p>

While some have floated the idea of retaliatory redistricting in blue states, they insist their primary goal is to make the harmful legislation less dangerous.</p>

The letter argues that this tragic moment in the region has highlighted the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination and that a viable state would need to recognize Israel and ensure its security. This move reflects growing international momentum for a two-state solution but contrasts with the Trump administration's position that such recognition would be "rewarding Hamas."</p>
