          <p>Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron is stepping down from his role, with Humam Sakhnini, former Activision Blizzard Vice Chairman, taking over as CEO and joining the board. Citron will remain on Discord's board as an advisor. This executive change comes amid speculation about a potential IPO for Discord, a popular social messaging service with roughly 200 million monthly active users. The company has raised $1.1 billion and is valued at around $14.7 billion, focusing on enhancing user experience and building a sustainable business rather than commenting on IPO rumors.</p>

Examples include the removal of 'transgender' from the Stonewall National Monument page and changes to descriptions of the Little Rock Nine. Historians, like Yale professor David W. Blight, view these actions as attempts to revise the past, echoing historical revisionism seen during the Civil War era.

          <p>Despite President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, manufacturers of disposable medical gear in the U.S. remain uneasy. The industry, devastated by cheap Chinese imports, faced critical shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. While tariffs aim to make the U.S. independent of China, some worry about the impact on responsible industrial policy. The few remaining companies in the U.S. that produce protective gear express concerns about the long-term effects of the trade war.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant rally on Wednesday, driven by comments from President Trump and other officials regarding tariffs, trade, and the Federal Reserve. Investors seized on these remarks amidst uncertainty about the White House's intentions. The S&P 500 initially rose sharply before paring back gains after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed speculation about unilaterally lowering tariffs on Chinese goods. The rally was partly fueled by Trump's statement that he had 'no intention' of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 7% increase despite reporting weak first-quarter earnings, driven by CEO Elon Musk's increased involvement and optimism surrounding potential reductions in China tariffs. President Trump signaled that duties on China would not be as high as 145%, boosting investor sentiment. Musk also announced that he would spend less time at the Department of Government Efficiency. The company's lackluster results included a 20% year-over-year drop in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly pushing for a breakthrough in the Russia-Ukraine war, with President Trump claiming to be 'very close' to a deal. However, the US plan involves recognizing Russia's claim to Ukrainian territory, which would violate Ukraine's constitution. As negotiations continue, there are signs that Trump may be preparing to blame Zelenskyy for the lack of a deal, potentially shifting blame and reducing support for Ukraine.</p>
