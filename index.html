          <p>Experts warn that hotel rooms can harbor significant bacteria, with some studies showing higher levels than hospitals. The most germ-infested spots include decorative items like pillows and bed runners which are rarely washed, high-touch surfaces such as remotes and light switches, and even bathtubs. Other frequently overlooked areas are glassware, ice buckets, and hard-to-reach places like curtain rods, prompting advice to disinfect surfaces and rinse any provided drinkware upon check-in.</p>

          <p>China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, has published a series of commentaries aimed at rebuilding the reputation of the force's political officers. The articles emphasize the need for unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, honesty, and integrity, particularly in the promotion process for soldiers. Observers suggest these guidelines are a response to recent corruption and misconduct among fallen generals, signaling Beijing's intent to repair the damage and reinforce ideological control within the military.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a transatlantic trade framework. The meeting aims to prevent the implementation of a threatened 30% U.S. tariff on EU goods, which is set to take effect on August 1. There is cautious optimism for a deal, with sources suggesting a potential agreement could involve a 15% baseline tariff, similar to a recent framework established between the U.S. and Japan.

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, was questioned for a day and a half by Justice Department officials. The discussions reportedly covered a wide range of topics and individuals connected to the case, though specific details were not disclosed.

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunisia's capital to denounce the rule of President Kais Saied, four years after he dissolved parliament and seized broad powers. Demonstrators chanted for "the fall of the regime," criticizing the government for jailing opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, and turning the country into an "open-air prison." The protest highlights growing discontent over what critics describe as a slide into authoritarianism and the crushing of political dissent since Saied's 2021 power grab.</p>

          <h2>Over One-Fifth of NASA's Workforce Applies for Voluntary Departure</h2>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing more than 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program. This significant exodus would reduce the civil servant workforce from approximately 18,000 to 14,000, raising concerns about the agency's operational capacity. The departures come amid a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and recent leadership instability, though NASA maintains that safety and its exploration missions remain top priorities.</p>
