          <p>President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on imports from approximately 90 countries, aiming to address trade deficits and boost domestic manufacturing. These tariffs, effective April 9th, include a baseline 10% tariff for all imports and higher reciprocal levies for specific nations. Asian countries face the steepest tariffs, with potential combined rates exceeding 100% for Chinese imports if Trump's threats of additional tariffs materialize. Economists warn these tariffs could reignite inflation and trigger retaliatory measures, potentially leading to serious recessions in the U.S. and globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports if China does not withdraw its planned retaliatory 34% tariff on American products. This escalation follows Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on numerous nations, aiming to rectify trade imbalances. China has responded with its own 34% tariff on U.S. goods, effective April 10th, prompting Trump's threat. If implemented, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports could reach a combined 104%, potentially increasing costs for American consumers by thousands of dollars annually and further spooking Wall Street.

          <p>Historical market data suggests that downturns, while unsettling, often present opportunities for buying assets at a discount.

Bear markets have averaged a 13-month decline followed by a 23-month recovery to a new peak.
