          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will remain in Pittsburgh, creating 70,000 jobs and adding $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel was previously blocked by former President Biden, but is now subject to another national security review. U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel both applauded the announcement, highlighting the benefits of the partnership for American workers and the steel industry. The agreement follows Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on foreign steel imports, with details about ownership and terms of the deal remaining unclear. </p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a budget package, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes significant cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, totaling roughly $700 billion and $300 billion respectively.

Critics argue that these changes will cause many people, including those entitled to benefits, to lose them.

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, advanced reactors. The orders direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and expedite approvals, while also urging consideration of lowering radiation exposure limits. The administration set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050, and will explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. Critics fear that the executive actions could cause the agency to take shortcuts on safety, while supporters believe that the actions are incredibly exciting. </p>

The case gained a break when the nanny, after ending her relationship with Worrell, provided information corroborating existing evidence. Worrell was arrested in Missouri and extradited to Georgia, while authorities continue to seek information about who fired the shot that killed Doris. </p>

Critics argue this move is intended to prevent Arevalo-Chavez from testifying about Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's alleged pact with the gang. Arevalo-Chavez faces racketeering and terrorism charges in New York, and his attorneys claim the dismissal is part of a deal with El Salvador to suppress the truth about Bukele's negotiations with MS-13.

The administration labeled CDN a "foreign terrorist organization," and officials claim the sanctions aim to cut off the cartel's ability to obtain drugs, money, and guns.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached the Pentagon on May 1, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at Reagan National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact caused the Pentagon tower to delay clearance for landing, resulting in the helicopter circling again. The cause of the lost contact is attributed to a temporary antenna's location, and the Army has since moved the antenna to the Pentagon's roof. The FAA declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation. </p>
