          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following controversial remarks by the host. Kimmel linked the individual charged with killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement, prompting backlash and a decision by affiliate owner Nexstar to preempt the show. The move has drawn criticism from free speech advocates and unions, who view it as a response to pressure from the FCC and the Trump administration, while former President Trump praised the network's decision.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist, to be deported to either Algeria or Syria. The ruling cites alleged misrepresentations on his green card application, though his lawyers argue the decision is retaliation for his political speech and procedurally flawed. Khalil has been in a protracted legal battle with the Trump administration, which initially sought his removal on foreign policy grounds before a federal judge blocked that attempt. He now has 30 days to appeal the latest deportation order.</p>

Current forecasts predict the storm will remain over open waters, tracking north of the Caribbean and away from major landmasses for several days. However, meteorologists anticipate it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves westward. While no immediate land hazards have been issued, the system could potentially approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office in what officials initially termed a "targeted attack." The suspect, identified as Donald Henson, reportedly exited the vehicle, threw an American flag over the gate, and fled on foot before being apprehended. Authorities noted that Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint that lacked a federal nexus and is believed to have a history of mental health issues. He now faces federal charges for damaging government property and assaulting a federal officer.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic defense pact, significantly deepening their long-standing security relationship. The agreement stipulates that an attack on either nation will be considered an act of aggression against both, establishing a framework for joint deterrence. This move comes amid growing regional instability and concerns among Gulf states about the reliability of traditional security guarantees. The pact was finalized during a state visit by Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>

Harris writes that she believed Buttigieg would have been an "ideal partner" but felt the political stakes were too high, a sentiment she believes Buttigieg shared.

          <p>This opinion article frames the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" as a significant and brazen assault on free speech, orchestrated by the Trump administration and its allies. It argues that the action, prompted by pressure from the FCC and affiliate station owner Nexstar, goes beyond typical "cancel culture" and represents a more dangerous use of governmental power to silence critical voices. The piece positions the event within a broader context of the political right's escalating efforts to control public discourse and suppress dissent, suggesting it sets a dangerous precedent for press freedom in the United States.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will adopt a cautious approach, implementing only moderate easing measures for the remainder of the year. This strategy is expected to narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries, which could help ease capital outflow pressures and provide support for the yuan. The PBOC's daily fixing rate for the yuan was set slightly weaker after the Fed's announcement, but the offshore yuan strengthened, reflecting market expectations of a restrained policy response from Beijing.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has declared his intention to designate the decentralized, far-left movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The announcement raises legal and practical questions, as the U.S. currently lacks a domestic terrorism statute equivalent to the one for foreign entities, partly due to First Amendment protections. This is not the first time Trump has proposed such a designation; he raised the idea in 2020, though his then-FBI Director Christopher Wray characterized antifa as an ideology rather than a structured organization, making such a label difficult to apply.</p>

          <p>The Central Council of Jews in Germany has publicly called on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government to continue its "unconditional" support for Israel. During an event commemorating the council's 75th anniversary, its president, Josef Schuster, urged Berlin not to be swayed by criticism from other European nations or internal political voices. Chancellor Merz, who was in attendance, affirmed that criticism of the Israeli government must be possible but rejected any criticism that serves as a pretext for antisemitism, stating that Jewish life is essential for Germany's future.</p>

          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published a report strongly refuting the Trump administration's attempts to downplay the dangers of climate change, stating the evidence is "beyond scientific dispute." The report directly supports the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," which concluded that greenhouse gases threaten public health and must be regulated. This comes as the current EPA administration is working to revoke that finding. The National Academies' report asserts that scientific understanding of climate threats has only strengthened since 2009, warning of a future where climate-induced harm worsens.</p>

In a new video, the world's top-ranked doubles player stated she was privileged to experience different cultures and that her comments were not representative of her positive experience in the country, vowing to "be better."</p>

          <p>The University of California's governing board has approved requests from five UC campuses to purchase additional weapons and equipment, including thousands of rifle rounds, pepper-ball projectiles, and drones. The acquisitions are part of an annual report required by state law on police use of military-grade equipment. The request comes amid heightened scrutiny of UC's handling of campus protests, particularly at UCLA, where police deployed pepper balls and sponge foam rounds against demonstrators in 2024. Critics voiced concerns that the new weapons would be used against students and faculty exercising their free speech rights.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists measured the alcohol content of figs and plum-like fruits in the chimps' diet, finding it averaged around 0.3% by weight. While not enough to cause intoxication, the steady, low-dose exposure supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our primate ancestors who associated the scent of ethanol with ripe, calorie-rich food.</p>

The recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce reforms to the Send system, which has been criticized as financially unsustainable despite a rising number of children requiring legally binding support plans.</p>

The report highlights that children and people of color are disproportionately affected and warns that recent state and federal budget cuts to social safety nets could exacerbate the problem.</p>
