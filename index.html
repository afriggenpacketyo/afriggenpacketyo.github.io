          <h2>Germany Proposes New Military Draft Plan Amid European Security Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 03:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Defense Minister has introduced a draft bill to re-establish a form of military conscription, which was suspended in 2011, to address the changing security landscape in Europe. The proposal is a compromise, allowing the government to call up conscripts if required for national defense, without a full return to compulsory service. The plan aims to bolster the Bundeswehr by increasing active soldiers and doubling the number of reservists to 200,000, partly by making voluntary service more financially attractive. This initiative is a direct response to new NATO guidelines and Russia's aggression, aiming to have the new system in place by 2026.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has reached a £55 million agreement with Nottingham Forest to sign 23-year-old winger Anthony Elanga. The move is part of Newcastle's strategy to strengthen their squad as they prepare for their return to the Champions League. Elanga, a Swedish international, had a successful season with Forest, contributing six goals and eleven assists. This transfer represents a significant profit for Nottingham Forest, who acquired Elanga from Manchester United for £15 million in 2023 after he had spent over a decade developing at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly held its policy interest rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' predictions of a rate cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time to assess incoming data to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its target, noting recent monthly figures were slightly stronger than expected. The decision drew criticism from Australia's Treasurer, who highlighted the country's progress on inflation and the government's cost-of-living relief efforts. The Australian dollar strengthened following the announcement, which comes amid a broader economic growth slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Colombian President Gustavo Petro asserts that governments have a duty to take decisive action against Israel for its conduct in Gaza, rather than remaining passive. He argues that countries must enforce a UN resolution by implementing sanctions, asset freezes, and an arms embargo. Citing Colombia's suspension of coal exports to Israel and South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice as examples, Petro calls for a united front to uphold international law. He warns that failing to act renders the multilateral system ineffective and makes complicit nations of atrocities.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump has recently achieved a series of significant successes, including a military strike on Iran's nuclear sites and a $16 million legal settlement with CBS's parent company. The author posits that despite these wins, media coverage has remained overwhelmingly negative, attributing this to a long-standing institutional bias against the former president. The piece suggests that positive developments are often reframed with a critical lens or underreported. However, the author also criticizes Trump for missteps, such as his divisive rhetoric about political opponents hating the country.</p>

A major focus of the discussions with Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be tackling illegal migration across the English Channel and reinforcing support for Ukraine.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover announced a 15.1% fall in retail sales for the three months to June, attributing the decline partly to the threat of US tariffs. The UK-based automaker had temporarily paused shipments to the United States in April after the Trump administration announced new tariff plans, impacting a key market for its premium vehicles. The company stated the sales drop was also influenced by the planned discontinuation of older Jaguar models as it shifts towards new electric vehicles. While a deal for lower tariffs was eventually reached, the uncertainty affected wholesale performance in North America.</p>

According to the Financial Times, the Singapore-based company submitted a draft prospectus last week while also seeking approval from Chinese regulators. Shein has faced significant hurdles in its ambition to list in London or New York, largely due to scrutiny from lawmakers over allegations of forced labor in its supply chain, which the company denies.

A 2016 study, which cost $50,000, recommended a nearly $1 million project to enhance flood monitoring and public warnings, but it did not move forward. Just this April, a local water authority voted to select a firm for a new flood warning system, but the project's status remains unclear.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas is rapidly becoming a political issue, raising questions about disaster preparedness and federal aid. The tragedy has drawn attention to the Trump administration's previous commitment to reduce federal aid to states for natural disasters, a policy now under intense scrutiny. As rescue operations continue, the focus is shifting to the political ramifications, including the response of Texas officials and the role of federal agencies. The disaster's handling is being examined alongside other major political events, such as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to Washington and new tariff announcements.</p>

          <h2>US Delays Tariff Hikes but Confirms New Rates for Over a Dozen Countries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:59:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially delayed imposing its most aggressive tariff hikes, setting a new deadline of August 1 while notifying 14 countries of the specific rates they will face. The letters detail levies such as a 25% tax on imports from key allies Japan and South Korea, though the White House indicated the rates could be adjusted based on negotiations. This extension of the previous 90-day pause is seen by economists as a recognition that complex trade deals require more time. The move provides a temporary reprieve but maintains pressure on trading partners to reach agreements with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been moved out of the intensive care unit to a rehabilitation facility, over three weeks after he and his wife were shot multiple times in their home. The attack was part of a series of what officials have described as politically motivated shootings targeting lawmakers. The same night, state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot in their home. The suspect, who allegedly also targeted two other officials, faces multiple federal and state charges of murder and attempted murder and may face the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Key stock market indices, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, have formed a 'golden cross,' a technical indicator where the 50-day moving average rises above the 200-day moving average. This pattern is often interpreted by analysts as a signal of a potential long-term bull market. According to the article, historical data since 1975 shows that the S&P 500 has risen 88% of the time in the year following a golden cross, with an average return of over 12%. The last time this occurred for global stocks in January 2023, it was followed by a 43% rise over two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, just days after his administration confirmed a pause on some military shipments to the country. Trump stated that Ukraine must be able to defend itself from Russia's intense attacks and that the new aid would consist primarily of defensive armaments. This decision follows recent phone calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia. The White House had previously halted some shipments as part of a broader review, citing concerns about depleting U.S. military stockpiles.</p>

          <p>Singapore is emerging as an increasingly popular choice for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its appeal. Industry insiders note that while the U.S. has long been the top destination, factors like cultural adjustment difficulties and safety concerns are causing some students to look elsewhere. Singapore offers a compelling alternative with its high-quality universities, economic openness, and cultural familiarity. This trend suggests a potential shift in international education patterns, with Singapore benefiting from growing uncertainty surrounding the student experience in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report highlights the significant amount of urban land dedicated to parking in many U.S. cities, linking it to safety risks and poor urban design. San Bernardino, California, tops the list with 49% of its downtown area consisting of parking lots, followed by cities like Arlington, Texas, and Lexington, Kentucky. The study notes that 1 in 5 vehicle accidents occur in parking lots, resulting in thousands of injuries and hundreds of deaths annually. It attributes these incidents to factors like driver distraction, poor lighting, and flawed design, such as a lack of designated pedestrian walkways.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) appears to be phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening at some U.S. airports. According to sources, the rule has expired at several airports, including those in Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia, although travelers at other major hubs have also reported not having to remove footwear. The mandatory shoe removal rule was implemented nationwide in 2006, following the 2001 attempted 'shoe bomber' incident. The change brings the standard screening process closer to the experience for travelers enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to permanently amend its rules to curb 'renovictions,' where landlords evict tenants under the pretext of a substantial remodel to then charge higher rents. The new ordinance will prevent landlords from using a remodel as a 'just cause' for eviction unless they have a direct order from a government agency to vacate the unit for safety reasons. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated during legitimate renovations, including requirements for landlords to cover relocation expenses and provide comparable temporary housing.</p>
