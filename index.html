            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House violated the First Amendment by barring Associated Press reporters from covering events in secure spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One. The ruling stated that while the White House isn't obligated to grant the AP special treatment, it cannot exclude journalists based on their viewpoints. This decision comes after the AP sued the White House for restricting access after the news agency refused to adopt the administration's term "Gulf of America" instead of "Gulf of Mexico." The judge's order is temporarily stayed, giving the White House time to appeal, but the AP celebrated the ruling as a victory for press freedom.</p>

            <p>New York Republicans are proposing "Peanut's Law," also known as the Humane Animal Protection Act, following the controversial seizure and euthanasia of a pet squirrel named P'Nut by state environmental officers. The bill would mandate a 72-hour waiting period before the Department of Environmental Conservation can euthanize seized animals, allowing owners a chance for a hearing. P'Nut, a social media star with nearly a million followers, was taken from his adoptive family's farm after an anonymous complaint and subsequently euthanized, sparking widespread backlash. The Longos, P'Nut's family, hope the law will prevent similar incidents and ensure animal rights are respected.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the need for other players to step up, and the team will rely on depth arms until Snell's return.

            <p>The acting commissioner of the IRS, Melanie Krause, is resigning over the Treasury Department's plan to share immigrant tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The IRS disclosed an agreement with DHS to share names and addresses of immigrants. Krause is leaving due to disagreement over the decision to share taxpayer data. Treasury argues the agreement helps secure borders and pursue criminals. Advocates say the information sharing violates privacy laws. The IRS has been called upon to assist with immigration enforcement earlier this year.</p>

            <p>Alabama's new school voucher program, the CHOOSE Act, has received a substantial number of applications, with over half coming from families already in private schools or homeschooling. The program provides eligible families with up to $7,000 for private school tuition or $2,000 for homeschool expenses. The high demand raises the possibility that the state will need to allocate additional funding to the program. Supporters say the program empowers parents to choose the best education for their children, while critics worry about the impact on public school funding.</p>

The visit comes amid tensions over President Trump's assertions about China's influence over the canal. The Hong Kong consortium is selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc, effectively putting the ports under US control.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants alleged to be members of a Venezuelan gang, using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court clarified that those subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. The decision splits the court 5-4. Justice Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent. The dispute involves President Trump's use of the wartime authority to remove alleged gang members without a hearing. The ruling comes amid tensions between the president and the judiciary.</p>
