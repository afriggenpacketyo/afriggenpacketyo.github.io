          <p>The Trump administration has announced an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, citing India's continued procurement of Russian oil. This move doubles the total duties on Indian products to 50% and is part of a broader strategy to economically pressure countries doing business with Russia amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. President Trump has criticized India for its high tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers, setting a 21-day deadline for the new levies to take effect. The action underscores the administration's use of tariffs as a primary tool in its foreign and trade policy negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing, survivors and officials in Hiroshima expressed growing anxiety over the rising threat of nuclear weapons, particularly in the context of global conflicts. The city's mayor warned against the increasing acceptance of nuclear deterrence, urging world leaders to learn from the devastating consequences of the 1945 attack that killed 140,000 people. Despite calls from survivors for Japan to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the government continues to rely on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for security. The ceremony emphasized the urgent need to preserve survivor testimonies and pursue a nuclear-free world.</p>

The talks occurred just before a White House deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal or face severe economic penalties, potentially including tariffs on countries buying Russian oil. The Kremlin described the conversation as "useful and constructive," focusing on the Ukrainian crisis and strategic cooperation. This diplomatic effort takes place as Russian forces continue their intensified attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine, raising doubts about Moscow's willingness to negotiate.</p>

          <p>An analysis of recent trade deals shows a significant disconnect between President Trump's characterization of foreign investment pledges and the perspectives of U.S. trade partners like the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Trump has publicly described these multibillion-dollar commitments as "gifts" and "signing bonuses," while the partner nations view them as aspirational goals for private sector investment, not binding governmental guarantees. This discrepancy raises questions about the enforceability of these pledges, which are part of framework agreements rather than formal accords. The White House has warned of potential retaliation if the commitments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

The filing highlights the persistent challenges facing brick-and-mortar retailers, especially those catering to young shoppers who now discover brands through social media platforms like TikTok.

In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited supply due to stricter building regulations and high demand.

The research found that for every additional hour spent on devices, the risk of conditions like high blood pressure and insulin resistance increased, with the effect being more pronounced in 18-year-olds than in 10-year-olds. The study also suggests that reduced sleep and later bedtimes amplify these health risks, implying that screen time may be detrimental by displacing sleep.

Experts advise that a reverse mortgage can be a valuable tool for those who wish to remain in their homes and need supplemental income, as it provides funds without a monthly repayment obligation. However, it reduces the inheritance left to heirs and comes with fees and interest.

          <p>The National Natural Science Foundation of China has announced an additional application round for its Excellent Young Scientists Fund, a program designed to lure top scientific talent from overseas. Launched in 2021, the fund provides significant grants of up to 3 million yuan to researchers under 40 who commit to full-time positions at Chinese institutions. This expansion aims to bolster China's scientific community by attracting more outstanding young researchers to work in the country. The move comes as other nations, including the U.S., are reportedly facing cuts to research-related expenses.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Supreme Court's 2019 Ruling on Gerrymandering Enabled Current Partisan Redistricting Efforts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's 2019 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause is directly responsible for the current wave of aggressive partisan gerrymandering, such as the efforts seen in Texas. The 5-4 ruling declared that partisan gerrymandering was a political issue beyond the reach of federal courts, which Justice Elena Kagan warned would damage American democracy. The author contends that this decision gave a green light to parties to create extremely biased electoral maps, undermining the principle of "power is in the people" and fueling political polarization. The piece calls on the court to reconsider its stance.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of people are seeking help for aerophobia, or the fear of flying, a condition that affects millions of Americans and has been heightened by recent aviation incidents. A class led by a former commercial pilot, "Captain Ron," aims to cure nervous fliers by combining technical explanations about aviation safety with cognitive behavioral techniques. The class provides a supportive environment where attendees learn about turbulence, airplane mechanics, and breathing exercises to manage panic. For many, simply sitting on a grounded plane and learning to reframe their anxiety is a crucial step toward overcoming their fear.</p>

          <p>The University of California has confirmed that the Trump administration has frozen $584 million in federal research grants at UCLA, more than double the amount initially thought. The suspension follows allegations that the university acted with "deliberate indifference" to antisemitism on campus. UC President James B. Milliken called the cuts a "death knell" for vital research in medicine, science, and energy, and stated that the university will negotiate with federal officials to restore the funding. The move is part of a broader administration action against several universities over alleged civil rights violations.</p>

The company is working on making its core menu more affordable to re-engage this crucial consumer base. Stronger performance in international markets also contributed to the positive results, with the company anticipating a stronger second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In northern Nigeria, communities in states like Zamfara and Sokoto are resorting to making peace deals with violent bandit groups to survive, as state security forces have failed to protect them. These armed groups have disrupted farming, abducted and killed residents, and caused severe food shortages in the nation's agricultural heartland. While some villagers see the deals as a "rational survival calculus," others find it unacceptable to negotiate with those who have committed atrocities. Analysts warn these agreements grant legitimacy to non-state actors and represent a failure of the government's social contract.</p>

Reynosa is known to be controlled by a faction of the Gulf Cartel, and the region has been plagued by violence from disputes over control of drug trafficking, human smuggling, and fuel theft.
