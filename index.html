          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was found to have a rare chordoma wrapped around her brain stem. During an MRI before the initial surgery, a second chordoma was discovered on her spine, which could have caused paralysis if undetected. Dr. Mohammed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center devised a unique surgical plan, removing the spinal tumor through Flores' eye socket, a technique he called the "third nostril" approach. This innovative procedure avoided incisions in the spine or nose, allowing for complete removal of the tumor and reconstruction of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone, followed by radiation and rehabilitative therapy, leaving her cancer-free nearly a year later. The article highlights the success of this novel approach for difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed top Asian military officials at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning of an "imminent" threat from China to Taiwan. Hegseth urged Asian countries to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war, characterizing China as seeking "hegemonic power" in Asia. He referenced a 2027 deadline allegedly given by President Xi Jinping for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan, though Beijing has not confirmed this. Hegseth emphasized that the U.S. does not seek conflict with China but will ensure China cannot dominate the U.S. or its allies, while also encouraging Asian nations to avoid economic dependency on China. </p>

          <p>Doug Schoen, a Harvard alumnus, discusses the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard University, particularly concerning antisemitism on campus and the university's handling of related incidents. Schoen argues that while Trump's demands for reform are not entirely out of bounds, a targeted approach is necessary to avoid harming America's scientific prowess. He highlights incidents such as the Harvard Law Review awarding a grant to a student charged with assaulting an Israeli student and the revocation of a professor's tenure due to data falsification. Schoen suggests that Trump's actions have spurred Harvard to take steps towards change, advocating for a balanced approach that addresses concerns without undermining the university's vital contributions. </p>

          <p>US immigration authorities are collecting DNA information from migrants, including children, and uploading it to a national criminal database, according to government documents. This practice, largely carried out by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), involves individuals not necessarily accused of felonies, raising concerns about genetic surveillance. The DNA is stored in the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (Codis), leading to a significant expansion of genetic data collection since 2020. Experts criticize the program for reinforcing harmful narratives about immigrants and intensifying policing practices that target immigrant communities, with concerns about privacy and potential misuse of the data.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is scheduled for trial in August, but the case faces several challenges, including a lack of a clear motive from prosecutors. Kohberger's attorneys requested a trial delay, citing prejudicial publicity from an NBC Dateline special that allegedly contained prosecution leaks. The defense is also challenging the admissibility of evidence, including Kohberger's Amazon shopping history and a master's essay about handling a crime scene. While the judge has ruled against several defense motions, the absence of a motive remains a concern, with legal experts suggesting jurors will want to understand why the alleged crime was committed.</p>

President Trump's evolving trade policy has created uncertainty, leading some retailers to reduce or withdraw their full-year guidance. While some companies have been explicit about tariff-related price hikes, others cite "macroeconomic uncertainty." Economists agree that tariffs are inflationary, and a majority of U.S. CEOs report they have increased prices or are considering doing so this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The early Mission: Impossible films, unlike many modern franchises, prioritized the individual vision of their directors over strict continuity, resulting in diverse and unpredictable stories. Brian De Palma's noir-ish style in the first film contrasted with John Woo's maximalist approach in the second, while J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird stretched the limits of tone in the subsequent installments. These films allowed filmmakers to demonstrate their creative strengths, adapting the franchise to their unique sensibilities.

The van was found abandoned in Merced County, and a storage locker contained the merchandise, leading to charges of insurance fraud and filing a false police report against the couple.

          <p>Consumers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations this year due to economic uncertainties, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, summer travel budgets have been scaled back after President Trump announced widescale tariffs and the stock market dropped. The average summer travel budget initially grew by 21% year-over-year, but later decreased to a 13% increase. Travel costs are generally down, with hotel room rates and airfares declining, but inflation has reduced the amount of money available for non-essential items like travel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Strategy's bitcoin treasury strategy, which boosted its market cap, is now being replicated by various companies, including Trump Media and GameStop, but Wall Street remains skeptical. Trump Media plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, while GameStop has allocated $500 million. Michael Saylor, Chairman of Strategy, views this trend as a global shift in corporate finance, with interest exploding in Hong Kong, Korea, Abu Dhabi, and the UK. Under President Trump, the U.S. government is treating bitcoin as a long-term store of value, establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve funded through seized bitcoin, while the Department of Labor is rolling back guidance discouraging bitcoin investments in retirement plans.
