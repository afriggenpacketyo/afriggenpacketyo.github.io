          <p>The United States has altered the trajectory of the conflict with Iran after bombing Iranian nuclear sites, a move praised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu lauded President Trump for his decision, which he believes will change history, particularly in neutralizing Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iran, however, has stated that it had already moved its nuclear material out of the targeted sites. The future escalation of the war now hinges on how Iran and its allies choose to respond, especially given prior warnings from Iran's supreme leader about irreparable damage following any US military intervention. The bombing has provided Israel with a clearer point at which to declare the nuclear threat neutralized. </p>

          <p>In response to U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran's Foreign Minister stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty. Following the U.S. strikes, Iran launched a wave of missile and drone strikes against Israeli military targets, prompting Israel to initiate its own missile offensives in western Iran. The U.S. President claimed the strikes on Iran's nuclear sites were a spectacular military success, but this claim has not been independently confirmed.

          <p>Iran launched missile attacks on Israel, resulting in at least 21 people wounded, after the U.S. joined Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian missiles impacted several sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, causing significant damage to buildings and prompting search and rescue operations. The Israel Defense Forces reported that Iran launched approximately 30 missiles at Israel, and the IDF is investigating a possible issue with the interceptor systems in Haifa, where no alert sirens sounded. Since the beginning of Israel's operation against Iran, Iran has reportedly fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, prompted by the Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies in the original investigation, including blood evidence in the couple's bedroom. Some spots believed to be blood were not, and others were never tested, casting doubt on the prosecution's case. Despite this, the District Attorney's Office initially sought to retry her before ultimately dropping the charges due to insufficient evidence.</p>

Research indicates that transplanting islet cells into the spleen, with proper shielding, could improve their survival and effectiveness in treating type 1 diabetes. The spleen is being explored as a more promising long-term survival site compared to the liver. These findings could potentially transform the spleen into a hub for diabetes treatment, especially given the high number of diabetes cases in China and worldwide.</p>

The NATO Summit in The Hague is expected to feature tense talks on European defense spending, while Summer Davos in Tianjin will address trade negotiations between China and the US. Additionally, Germany's Day of Industry will highlight the restart of economic growth. The U.S. President has claimed that strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites were a "spectacular military success" that "completely obliterated" the country's major enrichment facilities.</p>

This portable device is designed for both defense and industrial applications, contrasting with similar lasers that require bulky cooling units. The team overcame challenges in stabilizing laser performance across wide temperature swings through innovative design choices, including minimal thermal drift pump lasers and heat-isolating components. The laser's core features a dual-clad optical resonator with ytterbium-doped fibers, emitting a lethal 1,080nm beam.</p>
