          <p>Renowned author Sir Philip Pullman has strongly criticized the unauthorized use of writers' works to train artificial intelligence (AI) software, labeling it a "wicked system" that amounts to theft. He advocates for immediate changes to copyright laws to ensure creators receive compensation and recognition for their intellectual property. Pullman argues that this practice, which allegedly affects all writers, stifles growth in creative fields. The government is currently consulting on AI and copyright, with expert groups formed to address these concerns and potentially introduce new legislation.

          <p>National Guard troops are slated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, extending their presence through New Year's Eve and Mardi Gras. New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick confirmed the deployment, emphasizing it as a partnership to support an understaffed police department, not a takeover. The assistance, requested by Governor Jeff Landry, aims to bolster security for major city events like the Bayou Classic. While crime rates are down compared to last year, the police department still requires approximately 300 more officers, making the Guard a crucial force multiplier for public safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has affirmed that the national inquiry into child sexual assault gangs will maintain its original focus and scope, despite three abuse survivors resigning over fears of dilution and concerns about the chairperson appointment. Survivors accused officials of attempting to broaden the inquiry to wider child sexual abuse, potentially obscuring the specific issues of grooming gangs, and criticized shortlisted candidates as "establishment insiders." Fiona Goddard, a survivor, stated policing and social work services contributed most to the "cover-up of the national mass sexual assault and trafficking of children." Mahmood expressed regret over the resignations, keeping the door open for their return, and emphasized the inquiry would explicitly examine offenders' ethnicity and religion.</p>

          <p>Hundreds protested in New York City's Chinatown after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted raids targeting counterfeit goods, leading to an unknown number of detentions. Videos showed multiple masked federal agents detaining individuals and shoving away onlookers, while an armored military vehicle patrolled the streets. Local officials and mayoral candidates condemned the aggressive tactics, with Mayor Eric Adams stating NYC does not cooperate with federal civil deportations. Critics, including the New York Immigration Coalition, labeled the operation "authoritarian theatrics" creating fear rather than safety within the immigrant community.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is grappling with rampant copper wire theft, causing over 37,000 streetlight outages and significant safety concerns, including a link to the fatal shooting of actor Johnny Wactor. The iconic Sixth Street Bridge remains dark due to $2.5 million in estimated repair costs for stolen wires. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, aims to curb the issue by increasing responsibility for junk dealers purchasing scrap metal and raising penalties for unauthorized sales to public entities. City officials are also exploring solar lighting and updated funding for maintenance to restore light to affected communities.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year rebound in September, breaking a four-month decline, primarily driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, especially mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to fall by 13.3%, with auto shipments particularly impacted despite a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth. The data follows the appointment of Japan's first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, whose loose monetary and massive fiscal stimulus policies are expected to weaken the yen, potentially benefiting exporters and the Nikkei 225 index.</p>

          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, emphasizing that true hair health relies on basic care rather than expensive products or complex routines. They clarify that cold water doesn't enhance shine, and no product can repair damaged hair or split ends, which ultimately require a haircut. Furthermore, the notion of hair "self-cleaning" is false, as regular washing is essential to prevent oil and bacteria buildup. Dry shampoo is acceptable for occasional use but not as a substitute for washing, as overuse can lead to itchy and flaky scalp issues, underscoring the importance of proper hygiene.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a wrongful death lawsuit that he never witnessed drug use from his late teammate Tyler Skaggs, who died of an overdose in 2019. The lawsuit alleges the Angels are responsible for former communications director Eric Kay supplying Skaggs with fentanyl-laced pills. Trout described Skaggs as a friend and noted Kay's "wired" behavior, which he suspected was drug-related, but was unaware of the specific substance or Kay's alleged dealing to players. Five other MLB players testified to receiving opioids from Kay, highlighting a significant drug problem within the team.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why President Donald Trump achieved a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza but struggles to make similar progress with Russia over Ukraine. The key difference lies in leverage: Trump had unique influence over Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and strong ties with Arab players, partly due to Israel's attack on Hamas negotiators. In contrast, Trump's attempts to strong-arm both Putin and Zelensky on Ukraine have had little effect, with both leaders seemingly using his desire for a deal to their advantage. The war's complexities and lack of willingness from either side to yield territory present a significant diplomatic challenge, hindering any swift resolution.</p>

The research, involving over 58,500 patients, revealed significant variations in effects like weight gain/loss, heart rate, and blood pressure during the first eight weeks of treatment. Academics emphasize that these differences are clinically important and call for antidepressants to be closely matched to individual patient needs and health conditions. This initiative aims to improve treatment efficacy and patient adherence, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to mental health care, potentially benefiting millions.</p>

          <p>UK supermarket prices have soared, with orange juice serving as a stark example, increasing by 134% since 2020. This article attributes the surge to a "perfect storm" of factors, including crop diseases, extreme weather, over-reliance on single-nation supply (Brazil for oranges), new packaging regulations, and trade wars. While global orange consumption is down, the market remains concentrated, and price increases transmit faster than decreases. Experts suggest retailers may also be recouping margins. This analysis indicates that consumers might need to brace for persistently high food prices due to climate change and supply chain vulnerabilities, impacting household budgets significantly.</p>

Grijalva's delayed seating, attributed by Johnson to the ongoing government shutdown, prevents her from accessing congressional resources and exercising her duties. Critics allege Johnson is intentionally blocking her because her vote could be decisive in a discharge petition to release the Epstein files, which currently has 217 signatures, one short of the required 218. Mayes argues this disenfranchises Arizona's seventh congressional district, calling it an "unlawful breach" of the Constitution and democratic process.</p>
