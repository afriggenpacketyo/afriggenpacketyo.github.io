            <h2>Smartphones and Computers Exempted from Trump's New Tariffs</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-12 10:44:49 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs, including levies on Chinese imports. This decision alleviates concerns from US tech companies that gadget prices could skyrocket, as many are manufactured in China. Some estimates suggested that iPhone prices could have tripled if tariff costs were passed to consumers. Apple, along with other smartphone giants like Samsung, has been trying to diversify its supply chains to reduce reliance on China, with India and Vietnam emerging as potential manufacturing hubs.

            <p>An economist is expressing concerns about the long-term repercussions of President Trump's trade policies, arguing that the damage will not be easily undone. The economist suggests that countries will adapt by establishing new supply chains and exploring alternative markets, potentially leaving the United States behind. The economist points to recent free-trade talks between the EU and other nations as evidence of this shift. This situation is exacerbated by a lack of trust in America's reliability and adherence to international agreements, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As space travel becomes more frequent with missions to the Moon and Mars, the possibility of death in space is a grim but necessary consideration. Current protocols involve returning the body to Earth quickly for low-Earth-orbit missions, while longer missions might require preserving the body in a specialized chamber. The article discusses the implications of death in various scenarios, including exposure to the vacuum of space or the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. The ethical considerations of burial versus preservation are also explored.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war has created global economic uncertainty, with panelists discussing the potential fallout. Trump's belief in tariffs as a tool to strengthen the American economy is based on the idea that trade imbalances mean America is being taken advantage of. The president is consistent in his view on immigration and tariffs, believing that America should not be getting a 'bad deal'. The article highlights the president's conviction that trade imbalances mean that America is getting ripped off.</p>

            <p>Tennessee lawmakers are facing criticism for supporting strict abortion bans while simultaneously pushing policies that negatively impact immigrant children. The state senate approved a bill allowing public schools to check the citizenship status of students, potentially denying education to undocumented children. This action has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that it contradicts the lawmakers' purported concern for children's welfare. The bill is likely to face legal challenges due to its potential violation of constitutional rights.</p>

            <p>Despite the recent market collapse caused by Trump's tariffs, much of the conservative media has remained supportive of the president. While economists and business leaders warn of a potential recession, conservative news outlets often downplay the issue or cheer on Trump's policies. Some right-wing commentators claim the tariffs will lead to a "new golden age" for America, while others focus on other issues to avoid criticizing the president. Some exceptions include the Wall Street Journal, which has criticized Trump's tariff policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Credit card debt does not disappear when you die; it becomes the responsibility of your estate. While transfer-on-death designations can avoid probate, creditors can still pursue the transferred property to settle debts.

Temporary 0% interest rates on credit card debt can also lead to higher interest rates and monthly payments once the promotional period ends, suggesting the importance of paying off debt quickly.

While Trump's intentions may be to reindustrialize the US, the policies risk damaging alliances and undermining the dollar's dominance.
