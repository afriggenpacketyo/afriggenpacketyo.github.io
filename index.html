          <p>A severe thunderstorm with high winds struck central New Jersey, resulting in at least three fatalities and widespread property damage. Two men died in Plainfield when a tree fell on their car, and another death was reported in North Plainfield. In response to the "devastating storm," the city of Plainfield has declared a state of emergency and cancelled its Fourth of July parade, concert, and fireworks display. Officials are now focused on recovery efforts and supporting the affected families as they deal with the tragedy.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he was "very disappointed" with a recent phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting he "didn't make any progress" on the issue of the war in Ukraine. This call occurred shortly after the White House announced a halt on some weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns over dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. Despite the lack of progress with Russia, Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and they agreed to collaborate on strengthening Ukraine's air defense capabilities. The Kremlin acknowledged the call and stated it pays close attention to the president's statements.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that discussions are underway to form a new left-wing political party, following ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana's announcement that she was leaving the party to co-found the new entity with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated that the new party would offer a "real alternative" to the current political system. This move aims to formalize the alliance of independent pro-Gaza MPs coordinated by Corbyn into an official party. While some on the left of the Labour party have expressed support, none have yet committed to joining the new venture.</p>

          <p>A top aide to New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who was recently placed on leave for an alleged sexual harassment incident, had previously been the subject of an investigation into his workplace behavior. According to a Politico report, press secretary Avi Small was investigated for allegedly berating junior staff members, though the probe did not find a human resources violation. This development comes after Hochul, upon succeeding former Governor Andrew Cuomo, pledged to maintain a non-toxic work environment. Small was recently put on leave following an accusation of inappropriately touching a staffer at an office retreat.</p>

          <p>The Kent County Council in the UK has ordered the removal of all transgender-related books from the children's sections of its libraries, a decision announced by its Reform UK leader. The move was initiated after a complaint from a member of the public about an adult-oriented transgender book being displayed at a library entrance. While proponents call it a "victory for common sense," critics, including LGBTQ+ advocates and opposition politicians, have condemned the action as censorship that makes trans youth feel unsafe and unwelcome. The council has since clarified that the directive is to ensure all books are stocked in age-appropriate categories.</p>

Republicans are highlighting the bill's permanent tax cuts, increased defense spending, and border security funding as fulfilled campaign promises. Democrats, however, are focusing on the legislation's cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and food stamps, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will cause millions to lose health coverage. Polls indicate that a majority of voters currently oppose the bill, and both parties are strategizing on how to message its impacts ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The UN human rights office reports that over 600 people have been killed near aid convoys and distribution sites in Gaza since late May, labeling the situation "unacceptable." Most of these deaths occurred at or near sites run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). While the UN could not definitively assign responsibility for all deaths, it noted that the Israeli military has shelled and shot at Palestinians trying to access these points. The World Health Organization added that Gaza's Nasser Hospital has become a massive trauma ward, treating a constant stream of patients with severe injuries from these areas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed budget, part of a larger legislative bill, includes drastic cuts to federal science agencies, sparking fears of long-term damage to U.S. innovation and economic growth. The National Science Foundation (NSF) faces a 56% budget cut and a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships, with hundreds of active research grants already being canceled. This article from The Guardian is a callout for stories from scientists, researchers, and students to detail how these cuts at the NSF and other agencies are affecting their work and the future of American scientific output.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's proposed budget threatens to slash NASA's funding by nearly a quarter, a move the Planetary Society calls an "extinction-level event." The cuts would particularly devastate the Science Mission Directorate, with an 80% reduction for the Habitable Worlds Observatory, a key project for finding alien life. This funding crisis jeopardizes 19 active missions and could force the U.S. to cede its leadership in space exploration to other nations like China and the European Union, which are advancing their own ambitious space programs.

          <p>As groundwork is laid for a potential summit between President Trump and Chinese leadership, a prominent Chinese academic has stated that Beijing requires clarity on the U.S. position on Taiwan. Wu Xinbo, a dean at Fudan University, asserted that Trump should explicitly state that the U.S. does not support Taiwan's independence, a key issue for Beijing which views the island as a renegade province. This call for clarification comes after the U.S. State Department recently removed a phrase from its website stating it did not support Taiwanese independence, describing the change as a routine update.</p>

          <p>The European Union is considering leading an initiative to form an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has been hampered by a paralyzed dispute resolution system. The proposal, floated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, aims to create a new trade body with like-minded nations, potentially starting with the CPTPP trade alliance. This move is a strategic response to U.S. protectionism, which has blocked appointments to the WTO's top court, and market distortions from China, creating a potential bloc for open and fair trade.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology suggests that the definition of "cool" is consistent across various cultures. Researchers surveyed nearly 6,000 people in a dozen countries and found that individuals perceived as cool tend to share six specific traits: being more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous. The study distinguishes these "cool" traits from those associated with being a "good" person, such as conscientiousness and traditionalism. This research provides one of the first empirical analyses of what constitutes coolness on a global scale.</p>

          <p>A 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new bilateral trade deals are not finalized, sharply higher duties could be imposed on imports from dozens of countries, potentially triggering inflation and harming financial markets. The Trump administration has announced deals with nations like China and Vietnam but has indicated it does not plan to extend the deadline for others. Experts believe some nations may get extensions while others face the new tariffs, prolonging instability for businesses trying to plan for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A jury has heard that a widely filmed brawl at Manchester Airport last year began after an assault inside a Starbucks cafe. Brothers Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad are on trial for allegedly assaulting three police officers with a "high level of violence" in the airport's Terminal 2. Prosecutors claim the incident with police occurred after Mr. Amaaz had headbutted and punched another man in Starbucks. The brothers, who deny all allegations, claim they were acting in self-defense, but the prosecution asserts that CCTV footage will clearly show what happened.</p>

          <p>In Springfield, Ohio, community volunteers are in a desperate race against time to help Haitian families secure U.S. passports for their American-born children. This effort comes as the Trump administration plans to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, which could lead to their deportation. Without passports, thousands of U.S.-citizen children could become stateless or be separated from their parents if they are forced to leave the country. The situation is fraught with fear and uncertainty, as the security situation in Haiti remains dire and legal battles over TPS and birthright citizenship continue.</p>
