          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing internal dissent within the Labour Party over proposed welfare reforms aimed at cutting Â£5 billion from the benefits bill by 2030. The reforms include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), potentially affecting up to 1.3 million people in England and Wales. While ministers have introduced a 13-week transition period for those losing benefits, many Labour MPs remain opposed, with some suggesting the concession is insufficient to address their concerns that the reforms will push an additional 250,000 people into poverty. The Prime Minister insists the reforms are necessary to fix a system that isn't working for those who need support or for taxpayers, emphasizing that those who can work should work and those unable to work should be properly supported.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to expand deportation operations in major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, citing the presence of millions of undocumented immigrants. Trump claimed these cities, core centers of Democrat power, use undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state. He ordered ICE officers to maximize efforts to deliver the largest mass deportation program in history, focusing on the removal of undocumented immigrants and preventing the entry of anyone undermining domestic tranquility.

This development raises concerns for South Korea, as the battleground knowledge gained by North Korean troops could pose a future threat on the Korean Peninsula. Ukraine's military intelligence indicates that Russia has agreed to supply technology and expertise to North Korea for building long-range drones and improving missile accuracy.</p>

          <p>Robert Wood, former U.S. Ambassador to the UN, argues that the UN Security Council's inability to address the Gaza conflict stems from deep divisions and political exploitation by Russia and China. Wood recounts his experience at the UN, where efforts to condemn Hamas and support Israel's right to self-defense were consistently blocked. He criticizes some council members for prioritizing political agendas over achieving a unified stance, and he asserts that the UN's relevance to resolving the conflict is undermined by persistent divisions and a reluctance to hold Hamas accountable. The only way to end this war, according to Wood, is if Hamas disarms and disbands.</p>

          <p>Stephen Marche argues that violence is becoming increasingly prevalent in American political life, citing events such as the assassination of a Minnesota state representative and clashes between protesters and security forces. He suggests that the United States is transitioning away from discourse and towards violence as a means of resolving political disagreements. The author emphasizes that the parade was to demonstrate Trump's mastery of the means of violence, demonstrating to the military and to the American people that he can make the army do what he tells it, and established traditions and the rule of law will not alter his will. He concludes that the more a country needs to show off how strong it is, the weaker it actually is.</p>

Despite state laws protecting journalists' rights to be in public spaces during upheaval, the Los Angeles Press Club has compiled over three dozen verified incidents of law enforcement interference with journalists since the protests began.</p>
