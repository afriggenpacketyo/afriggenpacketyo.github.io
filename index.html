          <p>Mediterranean chain Cava exceeded sales expectations in its recent fiscal quarter, demonstrating double-digit same-store sales growth of 10.8%, driven by a 7.5% increase in traffic.

This performance contrasts with other fast-casual chains like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which have reported declining transactions and sales. Despite the strong quarter, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the fiscal year, with shares falling 5% in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nigeria has entered into a major agreement with China North Industries Group Corporation (Norinco) to begin local production of military-grade ammunition, strengthening its military ties with Beijing. The deal encompasses the construction of ammunition production lines, maintenance and upgrades of military hardware, servicing of battle tanks, and military engineering services. It also involves technology transfers and training for Nigerian defense personnel. This partnership marks a continuation of Nigeria's growing military cooperation with China, which began in the mid-2010s due to difficulties securing equipment from the US.</p>

          <p>Researchers are embarking on a project in Iceland to build a magma observatory, called the Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT), by drilling into a magma chamber and inserting monitoring equipment. The goal is to gain a better understanding of magma chambers, which could revolutionize volcanology and improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts. The project seeks to address the limitations of current forecasting methods, which rely heavily on pattern recognition and historical data. By collecting real-time data from within the magma chamber, scientists hope to develop more sophisticated models of volcanic activity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue of birthright citizenship, focusing on whether a single lower-court judge can block the presidentâ€™s policies nationwide. The Trump administration argues against universal injunctions, favoring limiting court orders to individual cases. This stance has sparked debate over the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches, with potential implications for immigration and other policy areas. Justices are considering potential compromises, such as limiting universal injunctions to specific circumstances or requiring three-judge panels for such orders.</p>
