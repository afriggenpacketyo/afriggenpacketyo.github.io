          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles after attempting to ask questions about immigration enforcement. Noem was providing an update on immigration operations when Padilla interrupted, leading to his removal and handcuffing by federal officers. Padilla stated he was seeking information on DHS's immigration actions and criticized the administration's response to his inquiries, while the DHS claimed he lunged at Secretary Noem without proper identification. The incident sparked outrage from California officials and prompted calls for investigation into the senator's treatment, with some Republicans suggesting Padilla broke the law by disrupting the press conference.

Senator Murkowski, however, sided with Democrats in criticizing law enforcement's treatment of Padilla, while the White House accused Padilla of disrupting the press conference.

          <p>A federal judge is evaluating the legality of President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to assist with immigration enforcement, following protests against the administration's policies. The judge questioned the Justice Department's claim that the president has unchecked authority to federalize the National Guard, referencing the Constitution's limitations on executive power. California sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president bypassed Governor Newsom in calling up the National Guard. The administration argued that the military deployment was necessary to protect federal employees and property, while California officials argued it was an inflammatory provocation.

          <p>Congressional Democrats and some Republicans are criticizing the multimillion-dollar cost of the Army's 250th anniversary parade, scheduled to coincide with President Trump's birthday. Critics argue the funds could be better allocated to supporting military families or medical research, while Trump defends the expense as minimal compared to the Army's service. The parade is set to feature 6,700 troops, tanks, and aircraft, with Trump receiving an American flag and administering the oath to Army enlistees. Protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies are planned to counterprogram the parade, with the main protest in Philadelphia.

The agreement could include a potential US commitment to revoke some of its tech embargoes in return for China’s relaxation of rare earth export restrictions. China had tightened its rare earth exports, displaying its ability to retaliate, which prompted Trump to engage in negotiations.
