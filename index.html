        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>All twelve members of the Fulbright scholarship board resigned in protest, accusing the Trump administration of meddling with the selection process by denying awards to previously chosen recipients. The board stated that the administration's actions undermine the program's merit-based selection and its insulation from political influence, potentially damaging America's credibility abroad. The State Department countered that the board members were partisan political appointees attempting to undermine President Trump's executive orders. The Fulbright program, established nearly 80 years ago, promotes international exchange and American diplomacy by awarding scholarships to students, scholars, and professionals. Optimism is low as the integrity of the scholarship is being called into question.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines in the UK are dominated by reactions to the chancellor's Spending Review, with varying perspectives on its impact. Some papers, like the Daily Express, warn of impending tax increases following the allocation of extra funds to the NHS, while the Guardian highlights the NHS and defense as the 'big winners.' The Daily Mail criticizes the review as a 'reckless splurge,' while the Metro describes it as the 'spend of austerity.' The Financial Times notes that some departments will face a 'squeeze,' and the i Paper suggests council tax is likely to rise. The spending review is portrayed as a rejection of austerity, though concerns remain about the fiscal situation beyond 2026. The varied reactions to the spending review highlight the complex political and economic landscape in the UK.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed eight new advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, replacing the previous roster. Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process and include individuals with a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Among the appointees are Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about mRNA vaccines, and Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions. Critics have expressed concern over the appointees' views and potential impact on vaccine policy, while Kennedy maintains they are committed to evidence-based medicine.</p>

Law enforcement found antisemitic messages and support for anti-Jewish terrorist groups on his cellphone. The incidents included kicking a Jewish college student, punching another during a protest, and assaulting a third victim wearing Israeli symbols. His sentencing is scheduled for October 1.</p>

          <p>Amidst ongoing protests against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, the Trump administration has deployed National Guard troops and Marines to the city. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the decision, citing the need to maintain law and order, while critics argue that the military's involvement could violate federal law.

Hegseth and Trump are defending the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles, despite objections from Democrats regarding their domestic deployment.

Paul criticized the decision as 'incredibly petty,' noting that he was the only senator disinvited. He accused the White House of running a 'paid influencer campaign' against him on social media and expressed disappointment in Trump's behavior. Paul opposed the budget bill because it would raise the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars, and he felt the White House was punishing him for his stance.

This event could pave the way for other late-stage fintech companies to pursue public offerings.

PepsiCo Foods U.S., Frito-Lay's parent company, confirmed the closure and committed to supporting affected employees. The closure is part of a broader pattern of PepsiCo facility shutdowns, attributed to declining snack sales and efforts to 'right-size the cost' of its snacks division.

The two had a public dispute after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill. Musk had previously claimed, without evidence, that Trump appeared in unreleased government files linked to Jeffrey Epstein, prompting Trump to criticize Musk and threaten to cancel government contracts.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that dirt track racing legend Scott Bloomquist's death in a 2024 plane crash was likely caused by 'the pilot's intentional flight into a building as an act of suicide.' Bloomquist, a Hall of Fame inductee, was the pilot and sole occupant of the aircraft that crashed into a barn on his familyâ€™s property in Mooresburg, Tennessee. The report stated that Bloomquist did not have a pilotâ€™s certificate. Bloomquist's family has requested privacy as they navigate this difficult period.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil based on claims that he is a threat to US foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that the ruling would take effect on Friday to allow for appellate review. Khalil, who has not been charged with a crime, had been detained since March after being deemed a threat by the Secretary of State. The judge noted that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech was being chilled, constituting irreparable harm. Khalil can still remain in custody based on claims that he inaccurately filled out his green card application.</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles experienced a quieter morning following the imposition of a curfew after protests against immigration enforcement raids. President Trump federalized National Guard troops and sent in Marines over the objections of California's governor, leading to legal challenges. Experts state that the federalized National Guard and active-duty military cannot act as police, except under specific circumstances like invoking the Insurrection Act. California has asked a federal court to block the government from using troops in LA outside of federal property, and the LA mayor expressed uncertainty about the Marines' role.

Trump expressed diminishing confidence in striking a deal with Iran, while Iran's defense minister warned that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of their military.

In calling it out, pointing out the danger of protesters turning violent and yet still calling for peaceful protest, Newsom has put Trump in a precarious position that the president may not have been expecting.

Trump is making a big bet on how far Americans want him to go, mobilizing National Guard and active-duty troops that the mayor and governor say they don't need.

          <p>Plans for one of three large hydro power schemes that would draw water from Loch Ness to generate electricity are to go before Highland councillors next week. Loch Kemp Storage Ltd has proposed building a power station and tunnels near Whitebridge, about 10 miles (16km) north of Fort Augustus. The Scottish government, which has a say on whether it eventually goes ahead or not, has consulted Highland Council on the project. The local authority's officials have recommended that the south planning applications committee does not raise any objections to the plans.</p>
