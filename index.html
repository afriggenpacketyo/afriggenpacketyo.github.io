          <p>S&P Global Ratings has lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles due to a nearly $1 billion budget deficit. The downgrade reflects concerns about the city's weakening financial position and a structural imbalance. The city's reserve fund has been depleted to close a gap in the 2024-25 budget, falling below the recommended 5% of the general fund. The lower bond ratings could lead to higher interest rates for the city, making borrowing more expensive, though Mayor Bass asserts that measures are being taken to address the concerns.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena-based lighting company, Nila, which designs specialized LED lights for various sectors, faces uncertainty due to President Trump's new trade policies, including a 145% tariff on Chinese goods.

Arriving in 1918 with little more than "10 dollars and a tambourine," McPherson founded the Angelus Temple, one of America's first megachurches, and a Christian radio station. Her theatrical sermons and innovative approach to faith made her a pioneer of Christian entertainment. Despite scandals and controversies, McPherson's story highlights Los Angeles's unique ability to foster new religious movements and self-transformation.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Chimpanzees Display More Empathy Than Previously Thought</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Durham University study has revealed that chimpanzees exhibit a similar capacity for empathy as bonobos, challenging the common perception of chimpanzees as predominantly violent and despotic. Researchers observed that chimpanzees console each other in times of distress through behaviors such as embracing and holding hands. The study, which compared the reactions of chimpanzees and bonobos to distressed group members, found that younger apes were more likely to offer consolation. The findings suggest that emotional sensitivity emerges early in ape development and could offer insights into the evolution of human social behavior.</p>

          <p>Author Isabel Allende's newest novel, "My Name Is Emilia del Valle," explores a dark period in Chilean history, the 1891 civil war. Allende, known for her stories about women in difficult situations, draws from her own experiences as a refugee after the 1973 military coup in Chile. Her work often reflects on her past, including her home country and her deceased daughter. The article provides insight into Allende's perspective on how fear shapes society and the resilience of women in the face of adversity.</p>

The cause is suspected to be a combination of weight from air conditioning equipment and water tanks on the leaky roof and excessive noise levels.</p>

The Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce have resulted in significant staff reductions, particularly in field offices.
