          <p>Neil Hopper, an NHS vascular surgeon, pleaded guilty to two counts of insurance fraud and three counts of possessing extreme pornography. Hopper, who performed hundreds of amputations, had his own legs removed in 2019 after freezing them with ice, falsely claiming sepsis to insurers for over £466,000. The court heard he had a "sexual interest in amputation" and enjoyed media attention. His motivations were described as a combination of obsession with self-amputation and financial greed.</p>

Emergency services responded to the incident, which saw the route 24 bus sustain front-end damage and emit black smoke. While none of the injuries are life-threatening, police have appealed for witnesses and banned smoking in the area due to a diesel trail.

          <p>India and Canada have taken a significant step towards normalizing their strained relationship by appointing new high commissioners. The diplomatic rift began after former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged Indian agents were involved in the assassination of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Both nations are now seeking to restore stability, with experts cautiously optimistic that renewed dialogue could lead to resumed trade talks and strategic alignment. The appointments signal a potential shift towards prioritizing national interests over diaspora politics in Canada's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy, in collaboration with Skydweller Aero, successfully completed a 73-hour nonstop flight with its solar-powered drone, Skydweller, at Stennis, Mississippi. This achievement demonstrates the drone's capability for long-endurance missions using renewable energy, reducing fuel reliance and costs. The drone maintained autonomous decisions, adapted to weather, and secured communications, proving its potential for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Future plans include longer tests in the SOUTHCOM region for tracking drug trafficking and border security threats, highlighting its strategic importance for defense and potential civilian applications.</p>

          <p>Gloucester, Massachusetts, is experiencing a pervasive "rotten egg" smell attributed to the decomposition of Heterosiphonia japonica, an invasive Japanese seaweed. Hurricane Erin's rough surf brought large quantities of this seaweed ashore, and high tides carried it into the Good Harbor estuary, where it is now decaying. The red seaweed, first recorded on the East Coast in 2009, spreads aggressively and has been linked to fish die-offs. Residents have reported the odor as "horrendous," but city officials expect it to dissipate as the seaweed breaks down naturally.</p>

          <p>Justice Democrats, the progressive PAC known for backing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is supporting Angela Gonzales-Torres in her primary challenge against four-term Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez in Los Angeles. The group criticizes Gomez for accepting significant funding from AIPAC and corporate lobbies, particularly amid the debate over Israel's war in Gaza. This move sets up a potential proxy battle between AIPAC and the Democratic Party's activist left flank. Gonzales-Torres, a community activist, emphasizes her working-class roots and desire for change, arguing Gomez is no longer rooted in the community.</p>

          <p>The US has deployed multiple warships to the Caribbean and conducted a deadly strike on a vessel allegedly carrying drugs, signaling an intensification of anti-drug trafficking efforts under President Trump. Officials claim the strike killed 11 "narcoterrorists" from a Venezuelan gang. This follows a $50 million reward for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's arrest on drug charges. Analysts suggest the naval build-up aims to pressure Maduro, though the scale is unprecedented for counter-narcotics operations. The actions raise concerns about escalation and potential violations of international law, despite Trump's stated non-intervention stance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. private sector added only 54,000 jobs in August, according to ADP data, falling below economists' forecasts and indicating a dramatic slowdown in labor market growth. This deceleration is attributed to consumer worries, labor shortages, and AI disruptions. While leisure and hospitality saw gains, trade, transportation, and education sectors experienced job losses. This report, coupled with rising jobless claims and declining job openings, intensifies concerns about labor market weakness ahead of the official government jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

This article details the odds of winning, the frequency of drawn numbers, and crucially, how state taxes impact a winner's take-home amount. States like California and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to receive significantly more after federal taxes. In contrast, states with higher income taxes, such as New York and Minnesota, result in lower net payouts for jackpot winners.</p>
