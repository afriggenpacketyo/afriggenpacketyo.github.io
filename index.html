          <p>Career officials at the CDC responsible for overseeing the agency's committee of outside vaccine experts have been removed from their roles, coinciding with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointment of new committee members, including COVID vaccine critics. These officials, including Dr. Melinda Wharton, were responsible for vetting nominees for conflicts of interest and managing the committee's operations. Kennedy's picks have been criticized for circumventing the CDC's usual process, raising concerns about potential biases and the integrity of vaccine recommendations. The American Pharmacists Association is now withholding endorsement of the CDC's new adult immunization schedule.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of tyrannosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum, which they say alters the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. The 86-million-year-old skeletons belong to a species considered the closest known ancestor of tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. This discovery bridges the gap between small, fleet-footed predators and the larger, more formidable giants like T. rex. The species also exhibits early evolutionary stages of features like strong jaws, which were crucial to the tyrannosaurs' dominance.</p>

          <p>A study in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that gun deaths among children have risen in states with more permissive firearm laws following a 2010 Supreme Court ruling. Researchers found that states like Alabama and Arkansas saw a jump in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearms restrictions. The study compared data from before and after the ruling, finding a significant increase in youth deaths by firearms in states with lax laws. Conversely, states with stricter laws, such as California, saw a decrease in children's gun deaths.</p>

          <p>The United States is partially evacuating its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to heightened security risks, with non-essential staff and their dependents being removed. The decision follows stalled talks over Iran's nuclear program, leading to increased regional tensions. President Trump expressed growing doubt about reaching a deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, as the US seeks to prevent Iran from enriching uranium in exchange for easing economic sanctions. The evacuation underscores the US government's concern for the safety of its personnel in the region.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, who passed away at 82, was a visionary musician whose sound epitomized the lore of Southern California.

His masterpiece, "Pet Sounds," showcased his expressive powers and ability to articulate complex feelings. Wilson's struggles with mental illness and creative rivalry with the Beatles shaped his career, but his genius and impact on American pop music remain undeniable.</p>
