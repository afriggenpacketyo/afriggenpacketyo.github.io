          <p>An attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, injured multiple people, some with life-threatening burns, during a pro-Israel demonstration. The suspect was taken into custody, and the FBI is investigating the incident as a potential "targeted terror attack." Witnesses described an incendiary device being thrown at participants in the Run for Their Lives walk, an event raising awareness for hostages held in Gaza, with at least five people sustaining burn injuries, including an elderly woman. All upcoming Run for Their Lives events have been canceled, and both President Trump and Colorado Governor Jared Polis have been briefed on the situation, with Polis condemning the attack as a "heinous act of terror." The scene has been contained, but the area remains evacuated while police investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack. Optimism remains low due to the intentional nature of the violence and the severity of the injuries sustained. </p>

          <p>UCLA's softball season concluded with a 5-4 loss to Tennessee in the Women's College World Series after Laura Mealer's walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth inning. Earlier, Megan Grant hit a two-run home run that was briefly under review, but ultimately upheld, extending the Bruins' season in the seventh. Despite singles from Savannah Pola and Jordan Woolery, and an intentional walk to Grant, Alexis Ramirez grounded out to end the inning, leaving the bases loaded. Ramirez and Sofia Mujica also contributed with solo home runs earlier in the game for UCLA, who finished the season with a 55-13 record. Although the Bruins showed resilience, they were unable to capitalize on their opportunities in the final innings. </p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie, in his first major television interview since the 2022 attack, discusses the near-death experience and his new book, "Knife," which explores the incident and its aftermath. Rushdie recounts having a premonition of the attack and describes the moment he was stabbed multiple times at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New York. He reflects on the irony of speaking about protecting writers under threat and the feeling of being dragged back into the past. Despite losing his right eye, Rushdie expresses a determination to fight back with art and language, refusing to be defined solely by the attack. The author's resilience and commitment to free expression are evident as he reclaims his narrative through writing. </p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie discusses the growing trend of censorship in America, noting that it comes from both progressive and conservative voices. He argues that suppressing speech, even with good intentions, can be a slippery slope that ultimately harms minority groups. Rushdie, who faced a fatwa for his novel "The Satanic Verses," emphasizes the importance of hearing from voices that may offend, as they challenge people and promote critical thinking. He expresses concern that offense has become an aspect of identity politics and encourages people to simply shut a book if it offends them. Rushdie hopes to be remembered for his lifetime of storytelling rather than the threats to his life. </p>

          <p>Jon DiMaggio, a former NSA analyst, investigates ransomware attacks by infiltrating gangs like LockBit on the dark web. He develops fake online personas to build relationships with hackers, aiming to understand their motivations and tactics. LockBit, responsible for attacks on organizations like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Boeing, operates as a "ransomware-as-a-service" gang, providing tools and infrastructure to affiliates. DiMaggio communicated with the leader of LockBit, attempting to convince him to provide the decryption key after an attack on Saint Anthony Hospital in Chicago. While recent law enforcement efforts have targeted LockBit, DiMaggio believes more resources and authorities are needed to effectively combat ransomware. </p>

The article highlights the importance of a "can-do" attitude, strong training grounds like NIDA and soap operas, and a grounding upbringing in fostering self-reliance. The distance from Hollywood is also seen as a blessing, allowing actors to develop their skills without constant scrutiny. </p>

          <p>A strong geomagnetic storm is forecasted to potentially make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., possibly reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm, triggered by a coronal mass ejection, could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with the storm on Friday. The northern lights are caused by solar wind interacting with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, and are best viewed in dark settings. </p>
