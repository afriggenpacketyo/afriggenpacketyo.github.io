        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey for a second round of direct peace talks, but expectations for a breakthrough remain low due to significant differences in conditions for ending the three-year war. Recent comments from senior officials in both countries indicate persistent disagreements on key issues. Fierce fighting continues along the front line, with both sides launching deep strikes into each other's territory. A Ukrainian drone attack reportedly destroyed over 40 Russian planes, while Moscow targeted Ukraine with missiles and drones, highlighting the ongoing intensity of the conflict. The optimism score for this article is low given the continued fighting and low expectations for the peace talks.</p>

          <p>Children attending schools near oil and gas operations in New Mexico are experiencing health issues such as headaches and vomiting due to pollution, leading to missed school days. A study found 694 oil and gas wells near schools, potentially exposing 29,500 students to unhealthy emissions. Researchers found elevated levels of pollutants, including benzene, near Lybrook Elementary School, correlating with sinus problems, nosebleeds, and nausea among residents. While the oil and gas industry contributes significantly to the state's economy and school funding, concerns persist about the health impacts on students.</p>
