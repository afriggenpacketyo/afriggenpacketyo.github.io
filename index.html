          <p>CrowdStrike's stock experienced a drop after the cybersecurity firm released revenue guidance for the current quarter that fell short of analyst expectations. The company anticipates revenue between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, while analysts had estimated $1.16 billion. CrowdStrike cited the ongoing effects of a widespread outage from the previous July and the end of its customer commitment packages as factors impacting revenue. Despite exceeding earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter and announcing a $1 billion share repurchase plan, investor concerns regarding revenue recognition and annualized revenue contributed to the stock's decline.

          <p>As the United States potentially wavers in its support, Europe is increasingly optimistic about its capacity to defend Ukraine. While Europe possesses the financial resources and artillery shells necessary, replacing key U.S. capabilities, such as operational intelligence and air defense, would prove challenging. This shift in sentiment reflects Europe's growing commitment to ensuring Ukraine's security in the face of ongoing geopolitical tensions, as well as the continued and urgent need for Ukraine to not be left to collapse against Russia.

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest of its kind since the war, was temporarily delayed due to a resident's refusal to evacuate. The evacuated area included the old part of the city, numerous hotels, bridges, the town hall, and train stations, but excluded the Cologne Cathedral. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the city's history as a major bombing target during World War II, highlighting the enduring legacy of the conflict.</p>

          <p>A Vox correspondent argues that a strong federal government is still beneficial, even with Donald Trump in power, because the primary issue with Trump's presidency is a lack of oversight, not excessive government power. While acknowledging concerns about potential abuses of power, the author contends that reducing government size could consolidate Trump's power. The author points to the COVID-19 pandemic response as an example of the necessity of a robust state and advocates for strengthening checks and balances rather than shrinking government. The author suggests that a larger government with proper oversight is preferable, as it can address basic needs and provide essential services.</p>

The bomber, Guy Bartkus, died in the blast, which injured four others and caused significant damage to the clinic, which did not perform abortions.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's proposed tax bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill, passed by House Republicans, would decrease federal revenues by $3.7 trillion and lower spending by $1.3 trillion, according to the CBO's analysis. The budget package faces opposition in the Senate, with concerns that it would lead to escalating deficits. Republican senators, along with figures like Elon Musk, have criticized the bill, raising questions about its prospects for passage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has escalated a tomato recall in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina to its most severe warning level due to potential Salmonella contamination. Williams Farms Repack LLC initiated the voluntary recall, with the tomatoes distributed between April 23 and 28. The FDA urges consumers to return or discard the affected tomatoes, even though no illnesses have been reported. Salmonella can cause gastrointestinal issues and fever, posing a higher risk to children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.</p>

Experts warn that the tariffs may increase costs for cars, household appliances, and building materials, as businesses are likely to pass on the added expenses to consumers. While some domestic steel makers may benefit, economists predict that the tariffs will negatively impact industries that rely on these metals.
