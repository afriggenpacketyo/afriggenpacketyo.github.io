          <p>A gunman shot and injured a Kentucky state trooper during a traffic stop before carjacking a vehicle and fleeing to a nearby church. At the Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, he opened fire, killing two women, aged 72 and 32, and injuring two men before being shot and killed by law enforcement. Authorities believe the suspect had a connection to individuals at the church, which is described as a small, tight-knit community. The investigation into the incident, including the police use of force, is now underway by state police and an internal review unit.</p>

          <p>In a discussion hosted by the South China Morning Post, leading China experts Li Cheng and Andrew Browne assessed the state of U.S.-China relations. They explored the potential trajectory of the relationship should Donald Trump return to the presidency, considering the context of ongoing trade frictions and geopolitical tensions. The dialogue delves into what the experts believe Trump misunderstands about China and how bilateral ties might evolve. This analysis provides insights into the complex dynamics between the world's two largest economies at a critical juncture.</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging facility on the park's North Rim. The blaze, which originated from a lightning strike and was initially managed as a controlled burn, also consumed the visitor center, a gas station, and other key infrastructure. The North Rim has been evacuated and will remain closed for the rest of the season. The fire also damaged a water treatment plant, releasing chlorine gas and prompting further evacuations of firefighters and hikers from the inner canyon.</p>

          <p>A Senate Homeland Security Committee report has identified significant failures by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report highlights a "lack of structured communication" as a primary issue, noting that critical information about a suspicious person was not relayed to Trump's detail in time. It also found that a countersniper team had an obstructed view of the shooter's location and that the agency had denied resources to the security detail during the campaign. The Secret Service has stated it is implementing reforms and has disciplined six employees.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer urged investors to separate their personal political feelings, particularly regarding Donald Trump, from their financial decisions. He argued that despite many reasons to dislike the president, the market has shown resilience, potentially due to pro-business policies and the power of individual investors. Cramer discussed the potential long-term deflationary effects of artificial intelligence and deregulation, suggesting these forces could counteract inflationary pressures from tariffs. He concluded that a pro-capitalist environment is fostering conditions for rising stock prices, regardless of one's political stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against a growing backlash from some of his own prominent supporters.

Figures like Elon Musk and Laura Loomer have voiced frustration, creating a public feud within the president's base.

While the hospital did not comment on the specific case, it confirmed a surge in "seriously unwell" children with measles, having treated 17 cases since June. The death is believed to be the second measles-related child fatality in England in five years.

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has placed Police Minister Senzo Mchunu on a leave of absence following public allegations of ties to organized crime and interference in murder investigations. Ramaphosa also announced a judicial commission of inquiry, led by the deputy chief justice, to investigate the claims. The allegations were made by a provincial police commissioner who accused Mchunu of obstructing investigations into political killings. While Mchunu has denied wrongdoing, opposition parties have criticized the president's actions as insufficient, arguing the inquiry is a delaying tactic.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and military ruler of Nigeria, has died in a London hospital at the age of 82 after a period of illness. A polarizing figure, Buhari first led Nigeria in the 1980s after a military coup before returning to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was marked by a campaign against corruption but also by economic decline, widespread insecurity, and persistent, undisclosed health problems. Despite a fraught legacy, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north, for his austere public image.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill aimed at pressuring Russia to end its war in Ukraine. Graham described the legislation as a "sledgehammer" that would be available to President Trump, giving him the authority to impose massive tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's economy. The push for the bill comes as Trump has expressed growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the conflict, signaling that the door for diplomacy is "about to close."</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been repurposed into a unique, privately funded art gallery that is free to the public. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and spent eight years renovating it into the Cookie Factory gallery, which opened in May. Precourt's mission is to provide a space for community connection and personal healing through art, which she credits with helping her own mental wellness. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and will run through September before a new artist is featured.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report on the assassination attempt against Donald Trump reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least 10 requests from his security detail for additional resources during the 2024 campaign. These requests included enhanced counter-drone systems, more counter-assault personnel, and counter-snipers. The report accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of falsely testifying to Congress that no requests for the Butler rally were denied. The findings point to a pattern of inadequate support and communication failures preceding the near-fatal attack on the then-presidential candidate.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has stated that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the committee overseeing NOAA, is sending bipartisan recommendations to the president for a major investment in forecasting infrastructure. She argues that better technology, such as upgraded Doppler radar and data analytics, could provide communities with more advance warning for extreme weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. The call for action comes amid scrutiny of the federal response and potential staffing shortages at the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its pressure on the Federal Reserve, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stating that the president's authority to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell is "being looked into." Hassett asserted that Trump could remove Powell "if there's cause," suggesting the administration may be building a case for his dismissal before his term ends. The comments follow accusations from other officials that Powell has "grossly mismanaged the Fed," specifically citing cost overruns on a headquarters renovation project. The ongoing conflict stems from the president's repeated demands for lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
