          <h2>Scientists Uncover How Dietary Fiber Protects Against Sugar Damage in the Gut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 16:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UC Irvine study has revealed that dietary fiber, specifically inulin, can protect the body from sugar's harmful effects by reshaping gut bacteria. Researchers found that gut microbes, when fueled by inulin, metabolize fructose in the small intestine before it reaches the liver, preventing fat buildup. This mechanism can even reverse signs of fatty liver disease and enhance the liver's natural antioxidants. The findings suggest personalized nutrition strategies and potential new treatments for metabolic conditions, emphasizing fiber's crucial role beyond digestion.</p>

The summit, co-led by Trump and Egypt's President al-Sisi, includes leaders from over 20 nations, seeking to solidify the truce and advance towards a lasting peace.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has strongly criticized Democrats, labeling their stance on the ongoing government shutdown as "hostage-taking" over a healthcare policy dispute. He argued that serious negotiations can only occur after the government reopens, accusing Democratic leaders of demanding concessions to end the stalemate. Vance emphasized the administration's focus on maintaining essential services despite the chaos caused by the shutdown and the resulting layoffs for thousands of federal workers. Democrats, however, counter that Republicans are boycotting negotiations to raise healthcare premiums.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance announced that President Donald Trump plans to personally greet Israeli hostages "in person" upon their imminent release by Hamas from Gaza. Trump is scheduled to fly to Israel, with the release expected late Sunday or early Monday, US time. Vance hailed the release as "a monumental thing" resulting from a new diplomatic approach, distinguishing it from traditional failed routes. This development follows Israel's approval of the first phase of a peace deal with Hamas, after approximately 250 people were taken hostage during the October 2023 attack.</p>

          <p>The trial of Maja T., a German national accused of attacking right-wing extremists in Budapest, has intensified doubts over Hungary's rule of law. Germany's Constitutional Court questioned the fairness of the trial and detention conditions for Maja T., who is non-binary. The case is further politicized by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's declaration of Antifa as a terrorist organization. While the European Parliament rejected lifting immunity for an Italian MEP involved in the same incident, highlighting concerns about political motivation, Maja T. remains in pre-trial detention, facing a potentially harsh sentence.</p>

          <p>A nor'easter is impacting the East Coast, prompting New Jersey to declare a state of emergency in anticipation of significant coastal flooding, strong winds up to 60mph, and heavy rainfall. The storm is expected to cause beach erosion and inland flash flooding, with some airports reporting delays and cancellations. North Carolina's Outer Banks is already experiencing ocean overwash, and New York City and Long Island are under coastal flood warnings. Utilities have deployed additional workers, and officials urge residents to prepare for the severe weather, which is expected to subside by Monday night.</p>

          <h2>Women Challenge Meta Over Targeted Pregnancy Ads After Experiencing Baby Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 11:05:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Women are confronting Meta over distressing targeted pregnancy and baby-related advertisements that continued appearing after they experienced miscarriages and stillbirths. Sammi Claxon and Rhiannon Lawson describe the ads as devastating reminders of their loss, forcing some to abandon social media for mental health. Tanya O'Carroll's lawsuit led Meta to stop targeting her individually, but the issue persists for many, despite Meta's claims of improving ad sensitivity. Critics, including a former Meta employee, argue the company prioritizes user acquisition over safety, with a new "consent or pay" subscription model also failing to address these concerns.</p>
