          <p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) has been officially designated as a right-wing extremist party by the country's federal intelligence agency, citing incompatibility with the democratic order due to its ethnicity-based understanding of the German people. The decision, based on a comprehensive review, has sparked controversy, with AfD leaders denouncing it as politically motivated and a blow to German democracy. The intelligence agency highlighted the AfD's discriminatory views towards citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries." The classification could have implications for the party's treatment in parliament, including eligibility to chair committees. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>In a hearing, the Justice Department outlined its plan to break up Google's advertising technology empire, arguing that the company has illegally monopolized the market. According to a New York Times article, the government intends to ask the court to force Google to divest tools used by online publishers to sell ad space and the technology that connects them with advertisers. Google's lawyers argue that a breakup would be unprecedented and harm privacy and security protections.

Although a high proportion of renewable electricity in the grid is one of the major challenges of the energy transition, it is not an unsolvable problem. Optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>Imagineers are defending their new Walt Disney animatronic, set to debut at Disneyland, despite ethical questions and criticism from Disney's granddaughter, according to a Los Angeles Times article. The goal is to capture what it would have been like to be in Walt's presence. The animatronic represents a shift in thinking for the Walt Disney Co., as the majority of its robotic figures are representations of fictional characters. Optimism score is 65.</p>
          <p>65/100</p>

          <p>Harvard has hired lawyers connected to conservative Supreme Court justices and President Trump himself to fight its case against the government, according to a New York Times article. The A-list squadron of Republican-aligned lawyers is a departure from the last time Harvard faced a headline-seizing legal fight. The roster of conservative-aligned lawyers was designed to give the university a boost in front of a court with a supermajority of Republican-appointed justices. Optimism score is 50.</p>
