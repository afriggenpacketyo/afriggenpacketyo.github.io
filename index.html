This announcement comes shortly after WBD revealed its plan to split into two separate entities focused on streaming/films and TV services/channels, respectively. The company's board will assess options including continuing with the planned separation, selling the entire company, or separate transactions for Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses. WBD's stock price has increased significantly this year due to speculation about a potential deal. The review process will determine the best path to unlock the full value of WBD's assets.

          <p>A Schroders study reveals that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before age 70, despite financial advice suggesting waiting for higher monthly payments. Claiming early reduces monthly payments by about 30%, while delaying until 70 increases them by over 30%. Many Americans need the income immediately upon retiring or are concerned about Social Security's future solvency. Social Security faces a financial crunch with potential benefit reductions by 2034 if no changes are made. (not investment advice)</p>

The heist occurred in broad daylight, with thieves using a crane and power saw to access the Galerie d'Apollon. DNA evidence was left at the scene, including on a crown left behind by the robbers. While the stolen jewels are priceless in historical terms, experts estimate they would be worth millions if sold on the black market. Security vulnerabilities at the Louvre were extensive.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department has instructed staff to refrain from sharing photos of the White House's East Wing demolition, which is underway to make way for President Trump's new ballroom. Construction on the 90,000-square-foot, $250 million ballroom began recently, replacing parts of the East Wing. The warning followed the circulation of photos depicting excavators tearing down sections of the building. Treasury officials cited concerns that carelessly shared images could reveal sensitive security features or structural details. The ballroom's construction is being funded by Trump and private donors.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democrats are notably avoiding endorsing or even mentioning Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist running for mayor of New York City. While other prominent Democrats have supported Mamdani, New Jersey lawmakers are focused on the state's gubernatorial election. Some New Jersey politicians have openly criticized Mamdani, labeling him a "job-killing socialist." The New Jersey election is highly anticipated following President Trump's gains with voters in the state in the 2024 election.</p>

It highlights shutdowns under Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, Obama, and Trump, often stemming from disagreements over spending, healthcare, or immigration. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

          <p>The article critiques the romantic relationship between an adult coach and a teenage player in the film *Bend It Like Beckham*, arguing that it normalizes an inappropriate power dynamic. The author notes that such relationships have been exposed as harmful, particularly in women's soccer. The film, released in 2002, may have been prescient about the issues that would later be revealed in women's soccer, but it also exemplifies how abuse in sport can thrive in plain sight. The article suggests a sequel should address the problematic relationship.</p>

          <p>Ian Cleary, who sent a Facebook message admitting to sexual assault, was sentenced to between two and four years in prison. The sentence was below state guidelines due to Cleary's guilty plea, remorse, and history of mental illness. The victim, Shannon Keeler, expressed that the messages reopened old wounds and highlighted the systemic reluctance to prosecute campus sexual assault cases. Cleary apologized to Keeler and his father, committing to mental health treatment.</p>

          <p>New details have surfaced regarding Prince Andrew's lease agreement for Royal Lodge, revealing that he made large lump-sum payments upfront instead of paying annual rent. These payments, totaling around £8 million, effectively bought him out of future rent obligations for the 75-year lease. The lease documents also specify upkeep responsibilities and restrictions, such as no helicopter landings or gambling. Questions remain about how Andrew funded the initial payments, given his lack of financial support from the King.</p>

          <p>The German government's plan to deport Syrian war refugees faces significant challenges due to legal and humanitarian concerns. Humanitarian organizations argue that Syria is at its limit, with millions internally displaced and struggling to rebuild. Deportations would worsen the situation, and every individual case must be assessed. Even if a repatriation deal is negotiated, German law prohibits deporting individuals at risk of torture or human rights abuses. The plan has drawn criticism for moral and economic reasons, given the growing number of Syrians working in Germany.</p>

          <p>While tech CEOs make ambitious claims about AI's coding capabilities, many software engineers remain skeptical about the new age of automation. Although AI tools have changed how coding works for some developers and there are now fewer of the most junior software engineers, the productivity boost from using AI depends on choosing appropriate uses and having relevant expertise. Researchers coined the term "workslop" to describe this. Some engineers report spending more time fixing AI-generated code than writing it themselves. AI excels in repetitive tasks where accuracy is less critical.</p>

The article discusses the two potential methods: impeachment and conviction by the Senate, and Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. Section 4 is designed for when a president is unable to perform the duties of president. However, both methods require significant political will and high thresholds for removal, making it difficult to unseat a president between elections.</p>
