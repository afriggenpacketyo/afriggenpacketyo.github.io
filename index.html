          <p>President Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs sent global stock markets into a sharp decline, marking the steepest drop for US stocks since 2020.  China and the EU vowed retaliation, raising concerns about a potential trade war and its impact on global growth.  The tariffs, ranging from 10% to over 50%, are intended to boost domestic manufacturing and federal revenue, but economists warn of potential negative consequences for consumers and the overall economy.</p>
