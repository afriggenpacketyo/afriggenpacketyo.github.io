          <p>The Trump administration's defunding of Voice of America (VOA) has significantly impacted countries like Turkey, where press freedom is already under threat. VOA, a rare source of uncensored news, was banned in Turkey in 2022, and the shutdown has silenced a critical voice for Turkish audiences, especially regarding U.S.-Turkey relations. The article highlights the importance of international media organizations like VOA in countries with polarized press environments, noting VOA's role in amplifying the voices of Turkey's civil society.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An emerging parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" prioritizes emotional attunement and creating a secure environment for children. This approach focuses on accepting children's emotions, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to manage their own reactions, and embrace their child's authentic self. The article suggests that emotional safety is a crucial element often missing in homes, offering practical steps for parents to cultivate trust and connection with their children.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest drone and missile barrages on Ukraine, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries across the country, signaling a concerning escalation despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations. The attacks, involving a high volume of missiles and drones, overwhelmed Ukrainian air defenses and targeted both well-protected and poorly defended regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, emphasizing the urgent need for increased international pressure on Russia to halt the violence. Despite the conflict, Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, marking a rare instance of cooperation amidst the ongoing hostilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's warming relations with the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, have complicated Israel's military strategy in Syria. After months of Israeli airstrikes aimed at preventing hostile groups from gaining power, Trump's meeting with al-Shara and plans to lift sanctions have led to a near cessation of Israeli attacks. This shift in U.S. policy has undermined Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor, forcing the Israeli government to reassess its approach and seek dialogue with the Syrian regime. The change reflects a broader reshaping of the Middle East due to evolving American foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Starr County, Texas, once a Democratic stronghold, voted Republican in 2024, showcasing a significant political realignment driven by localized traditions and evolving ideological sorting. The shift reflects a broader trend of nonwhite working-class voters, particularly Hispanics, moving away from the Democratic Party. This change is attributed to the weakening of old partisan ties and the increasing influence of national polarization, where cultural beliefs dictate voting patterns. The article suggests that this realignment poses a challenge for Democrats, as it cannot be fixed with better messaging but requires addressing the ideological leanings of moderate to conservative voters.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's beloved pav bread, a staple food for the working class, is at risk due to a government ban on wood-fired bakeries aimed at reducing pollution. While the ban is intended to improve air quality, critics argue that it unfairly targets small businesses and ignores larger sources of pollution. Pav bakers worry that switching to cleaner fuels will increase costs, making the bread unaffordable for many. The article highlights the cultural significance of pav and the challenges of balancing environmental concerns with economic realities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is strategically dismantling American democracy by repurposing its institutions to undermine their original intent. By turning legal and regulatory systems against themselves, Trump and his allies have created an "autoimmune disorder" where the features of democracy are used to destroy it. The article argues that this approach, supported by a network of right-wing think tanks, is a calculated effort to undo the grand American democratic tradition. The author suggests that resisting Trump requires rewiring democracy through local political action, civil disobedience, and social mobilization.</p>
