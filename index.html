          <p>Pershing Square Capital Management CEO Bill Ackman described Donald Trump as the "most pro-business president we've ever had" during a television appearance. He credited Trump's policies, such as infrastructure and tax bills, for creating a positive environment for businesses, and noted the Federal Reserve's accommodative stance on interest rates. While initially concerned about Trump's tariff policies, Ackman stated that he now trusts the president's judgment and believes geopolitical risks for the market are declining. He also commented on New York City politics, urging business leaders to oppose the Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year financial forecast. The automaker's stock surged over 11% following the announcement, which also included a reduced estimate for the impact of tariffs. CEO Mary Barra expressed confidence in the company's trajectory, attributing the strong performance to the efforts of the GM team and a compelling vehicle portfolio. Despite a significant pullback in its all-electric vehicle strategy which impacted net income, the company is focusing on improving profitability in its North American and EV segments.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced it is expanding its strategic review to include a potential sale of the company after receiving "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties. This news caused the company's shares to jump significantly in premarket trading. The media giant, which was already planning to separate into two entities, is now considering all options to unlock the full value of its assets. CEO David Zaslav stated that the interest from others validates the significant value of WBD's portfolio, which has been working to reduce over $40 billion in debt since the 2022 merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon emphasized the importance of giving undivided attention during professional meetings, labeling the use of iPads or phones for emails as "disrespectful." He stated that proper meeting etiquette, including preparation and active listening, demonstrates passion and commitment to one's work. Dimon, who advocates for a five-day in-office policy, believes meetings should be purposeful, start and end on time, and always have a follow-up list. Experts suggest that taking notes with a pen and paper can improve focus and information retention compared to digital devices, which may lead to distractions.</p>

          <p>American cattle ranchers are facing a dual threat from the potential re-emergence of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite and President Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina. Ranchers argue that importing beef is not a sustainable solution for a domestic supply chain already strained by drought and a historically low cattle herd size. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association criticized the import plan, warning it could create market chaos and harm rural America without lowering consumer prices. They urge the government to focus on biosecurity measures to eradicate the screwworm threat rather than intervening in market dynamics.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a period of political uncertainty after her party's poor election performance in July. Takaichi, a protege of the late Shinzo Abe, secured the position after her Liberal Democratic Party formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. Her government faces significant challenges, including public anger over rising prices, and will need to court other opposition groups to pass legislation. Takaichi is expected to pursue a hawkish agenda, including strengthening the military and revising the country's pacifist constitution.</p>

          <p>A newly surfaced document details the 2003 lease agreement that allows Prince Andrew to reside at the 30-room Royal Lodge in Windsor for a token rent. The deal with the Crown Estate required him to make substantial up-front payments, including over £8 million for renovations and to buy out future rent obligations for the 75-year lease. This arrangement explains his ability to afford the lavish home despite no longer being a working royal, though questions remain about his funding for ongoing upkeep. The lease, which is considered legally solid, presents a challenge for Buckingham Palace, which has reportedly wanted him to move.</p>

Experts argue that AI's true value is as a co-pilot for experienced programmers, not a replacement, as it lacks higher-level problem-solving skills. Studies on AI's productivity benefits have shown mixed results, and some engineers feel pressure from management to use AI even when it's not the best solution for the problem.</p>

The frequency of shutdowns has increased over the past decade amid heightened political polarization, with the longest being a 34-day impasse in late 2018 over border wall funding, which caused an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses.</p>

While national average rates for one- to five-year CDs are below 2%, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some short-term CDs offering over 4% APY. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of around six months to one year currently have higher interest rates than longer-term options.

The judges noted that the plot, which Plumb claimed was mere fantasy, had life-changing consequences for Ms. Willoughby.</p>

          <h2>Scientists in Madagascar Trial Novel Approach to Combat Overfishing and Hunger by Building Artificial Reefs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 09:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, where overfishing has devastated coral reefs and the livelihoods of coastal communities, a novel conservation project is underway to restore the fishery without restricting access. The initiative, led by the nonprofit Reef Doctor, involves building new, artificial reefs from limestone and seeding them with marine life to create new fishing grounds. This approach aims to address the root cause of the problem—poverty and food insecurity—which drives unsustainable fishing practices. By linking ecosystem health directly to human well-being, researchers hope to demonstrate that environmental interventions can also serve as effective public health solutions in one of the world's poorest nations.</p>

          <h2>Commercial Flight Makes Emergency Return After Pilots Misinterpret Intercom Static as Cockpit Breach</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An American Airlines flight from Omaha to Los Angeles made an emergency return shortly after takeoff when pilots mistook static for an attempted cockpit invasion. The misunderstanding occurred because an intercom system used for communication between the cockpit and cabin had been accidentally left on. The resulting static noise led the pilots to believe a security threat was in progress, prompting them to turn the plane around. Passengers were left confused by the incident, which the Omaha Airport Authority later confirmed was not a security-related event. The flight was operated by SkyWest on behalf of American Airlines.</p>

They will face the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are aiming to become the first team in 25 years to win consecutive titles. The Blue Jays secured their spot after a dramatic Game 7 victory over Seattle in the American League Championship Series. With home-field advantage, Toronto represents an entire nation's hopes against a powerhouse Dodgers team featuring superstar Shohei Ohtani. The series presents a contrast between a team returning to the championship after a long absence and a dominant franchise seeking to cement a dynasty.</p>

          <p>In response to a new U.S.-Australia agreement on critical minerals, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that resource-rich countries should actively work to stabilize global supply chains. The deal between Washington and Canberra is widely seen as an effort to counter Beijing's dominance in the rare earths market, a sector crucial for manufacturing everything from cars to semiconductors. A Chinese spokesperson emphasized that global supply chains are a result of market forces and called for normal economic cooperation. The statement comes shortly after China announced expanded export controls on rare earths, a move that has raised concerns about potential disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential tragedy was prevented at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when police arrested a man whose family reported he was heading there to "shoot it up." The family alerted authorities after seeing Billy Joe Cagle, 49, livestreaming his intentions on social media. Police located Cagle inside the terminal and found an AR-15 rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck parked outside. Officials credited the family's decision to "see something and say something" for the successful intervention. Cagle faces multiple charges, including making terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, Japan's newly elected first female prime minister, faces a series of immediate and significant tests, including healing a divided party and addressing public economic anxiety. A disciple of former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to pursue expansive fiscal policies to combat stagnant wages and rising costs, which have fueled a sense of malaise among the public. Her new and untested coalition with the right-leaning Japan Innovation Party adds a layer of political instability. Furthermore, she must navigate complex foreign policy challenges, including an upcoming visit from U.S. President Donald Trump, who may bring new demands regarding defense spending.</p>
