          <h2>States Challenge Trump's Tariff Authority in New Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 16:30:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has initiated legal action against President Trump's administration, contesting the legality of newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports. Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, the states argue that the president is overstepping his constitutional authority by unilaterally imposing taxes, a power reserved for Congress. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, asserts that Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the tariffs is unprecedented and unlawful, potentially disrupting the American economy. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes echoed these concerns, stating that the tariffs amount to a tax increase on Arizona consumers.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg revealed that China has begun returning planes and halting further deliveries due to the escalating tariff environment. Approximately 50 airplanes were planned for delivery to China this year, but Boeing is now redirecting its supply to meet stable demand from other customers. While Boeing doesn't anticipate immediate cost impacts, its primary focus is maintaining a healthy supply chain to ensure continued deliveries.

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue, with same-store sales declining for the first time since 2020, citing a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather conditions. The company lowered its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth, anticipating no traffic growth until the second half of the year. Despite the revenue miss, Chipotle's earnings per share aligned with expectations, and the company reiterated plans to open new restaurants.

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to accept Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations. Trump stated that a deal to end the war was "very close," but Zelenskyy's stance prolongs the conflict. This follows Vice President JD Vance outlining a U.S. vision for a deal that would freeze territorial lines and require both Ukraine and Russia to cede territory. Ukraine has consistently maintained it will not relinquish Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, making the path to a negotiated settlement increasingly complex.</p>

          <p>YouTube is celebrating its 20th anniversary, marking two decades since the first video was uploaded, and is projected to become the largest media company by revenue in 2025, surpassing Disney. Analysts estimate YouTube's standalone value between $475 billion and $550 billion. The platform's growth is fueled by its Premium, Music, and YouTube TV subscription offerings, and it benefits from its integration within Google's business, leveraging contextual data for targeted advertising. As Google faces competition in its core search business, YouTube remains a critical driver of growth and a hedge against potential slowdowns.</p>

These students believe that the current laws, enacted after the Parkland shooting, helped prevent even greater casualties in the recent FSU shooting. Despite these efforts, some Republican lawmakers are pushing to lower the minimum age back to 18, arguing that if someone can serve in the military, they should be able to purchase a firearm.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell was found guilty of conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019. Vallow Daybell, who represented herself at the trial, faces another life sentence in the Arizona case. She was previously convicted in May 2023 on all charges for her role in the deaths of her 16-year-old daughter, Tylee Ryan; her 7-year-old adopted son, Joshua "JJ" Vallow; and her husband's first wife, Tammy Daybell, and she was sentenced to life without parole. Chad Daybell was also sentenced to death on June 1, 2024, nearly a year after his second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</p>
