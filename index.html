        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump claimed that former FBI Director James Comey was calling for his assassination in a since-deleted social media post featuring the numbers "8647." Trump asserted Comey knew the numbers meant "assassination," while Comey denied any violent intent. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service reportedly opened an investigation into the post. Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt last summer, adding weight to his reaction. Optimism surrounding this event is low, considering the severity of the accusations and the potential threat to the President's safety.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, will replace its chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, due to a sharp decline in its stock price that stemmed from increased competition for its popular weight-loss drug.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers went on strike, bringing train service to a complete shutdown and impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike is due to a dispute over pay raises, with the union claiming they haven't received a raise in five years and that competition pays more. NJ Transit has suggested commuters work from home and is implementing additional bus service on 19 routes. Negotiations between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) have been unsuccessful, leading to the first NJ Transit strike since 1983.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to resolve disputes that threaten President Trump's domestic policy bill, with conservative members and blue-state Republicans holding firm on their demands. The legislation, which would extend tax cuts and increase spending on the military and border security, faces opposition in the House Budget Committee. Conservatives argue that the bill does not cut federal spending enough, while Republicans from blue states demand a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Speaker Mike Johnson is working to negotiate a resolution.</p>

Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated the measures aim to stop companies from polluting rivers while profiting. The regulator can now block firms from using customer or shareholder funds for bonuses if environmental and financial standards aren't met. However, Thames Water claims upcoming payments are "retention payments," not performance-related bonuses covered by the rules, and will not be customer-funded.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Gulf tour secured what the White House claims is over $2 trillion in combined deals for the U.S. economy, but a Reuters analysis indicates the actual value is closer to $700 billion. Many of the corporate agreements were non-binding memorandums of understanding, and financial experts suggest the headline figures have been padded to showcase cooperation. While the trip included significant orders of Boeing planes and defense equipment, experts caution that the amounts are inflated and some deals would have occurred regardless of the administration.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire, but New Delhi states the 64-year-old Indus Waters Treaty remains "in abeyance," raising concerns about water-sharing in the region. India's decision to suspend the treaty, which has historically withstood conflicts, could endanger regional water security. Experts worry that this move may erode trust among neighbors and prompt other countries, like Bangladesh, to prioritize their own water needs over those of neighboring countries. The treaty's suspension has created a legal gray zone, with potential consequences for the stability of water resources in South Asia.</p>

Some analysts suggest that Trump is sidelining Netanyahu due to disagreements over Iran and Gaza. Others believe that Trump is laying the groundwork for broader regional changes, including normalization with Saudi Arabia, but requires the end of the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and how much they need to afford a basic standard of living is growing. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The analysis considers costs beyond basic necessities, including technology, education, and health care. The findings suggest that traditional economic indicators do not accurately reflect the economic distress faced by many Americans.</p>
