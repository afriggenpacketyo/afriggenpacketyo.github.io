          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is intensifying in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to become the season's first hurricane. With maximum sustained winds approaching hurricane strength, the storm is projected to become a large and formidable major hurricane. While not an immediate threat to the United States, its path is being closely monitored as it moves west-northwest towards the northern Leeward Islands. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, highlighting its potential danger.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article, citing a new American Immigration Council report, argues that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has shifted its focus from targeting immigrants with criminal records to detaining law-abiding individuals. The report indicates that the proportion of ICE detainees with criminal records has dropped from over 75% to about 50% under the second Trump administration. This change in enforcement strategy is reportedly causing fear and disruption within immigrant communities, affecting families and individuals who previously had legal status or were not considered enforcement priorities.</p>

          <p>During the August recess, many Republican members of Congress are facing contentious town halls regarding President Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill." Following guidance from the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), lawmakers are sticking to prepared talking points, focusing on popular provisions like tax cuts on tips and work requirements for Medicaid. Despite voter concerns about healthcare cuts and tax benefits for the wealthy, representatives are largely avoiding direct engagement, highlighting a strategic effort to control the narrative around the complex legislation.</p>

          <p>Residents of Denver Harbor, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Houston, express concerns that a proposed redistricting plan will dilute their political influence and neglect their community's needs. The Republican-led initiative aims to redraw voting maps to create more GOP-held seats, potentially moving the neighborhood into a more affluent, conservative district. Community activists worry about losing representation on critical local issues like pollution and immigration enforcement. This move is part of a broader, contentious political battle over gerrymandering in Texas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. to address crime has raised legal and political questions about his authority to replicate such actions in other cities. While the president has direct command over the D.C. National Guard due to the capital's federal status, his power is more limited in states where governors control their own Guard units. Critics argue the intervention is a political maneuver, as federal data shows D.C.'s violent crime is at a 30-year low, sparking a debate over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

Speculation suggests that a possible deal could involve freezing the current lines of contact or forcing Ukraine to cede territory in the Donbas.

          <p>Top leaders from at least six Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are reportedly planning to attend a major military parade in Beijing next month. The event commemorates the end of World War II and is seen as a significant demonstration of China's growing diplomatic and military influence in the region. The expected high-level attendance from neighboring countries underscores the strengthening ties between Beijing and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>

          <p>A recent episode of NPR's Short Wave podcast delves into the scientific and philosophical challenges of defining life. Developmental biologist Crystal Rogers discusses the standard criteria used in biology, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli, to distinguish living from non-living things. The conversation explores ambiguous cases like viruses, which exist on the border of these definitions, and speculates on future challenges posed by advanced artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Carlsberg's CEO, consumers under financial pressure are increasingly choosing either premium or economy beers, squeezing sales of mid-range "core" brands. This trend of "bifurcation" is affecting brewers globally, who are already contending with declining sales volumes as drinkers push back against higher prices. The shift also sees more consumption happening at home rather than in bars and restaurants, reflecting broader changes in consumer spending habits amid economic headwinds.</p>

          <p>For those struggling with insomnia, especially during hot summer nights, several evidence-based strategies can improve sleep. Daily exercise, for instance, has been shown to increase sleep duration and quality by boosting melatonin production and reducing stress. Other effective habits include avoiding caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and reducing screen time before bed, as the mental stimulation can disrupt sleep patterns. Simple techniques like deep breathing exercises can also help calm the nervous system and make it easier to fall asleep.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study from Tsinghua University has quantified China's massive role in the global textile industry, revealing it produced over one billion tonnes of textile fibers between 1978 and 2022. This period of intense production coincided with the country's rapid economic development, establishing it as the world's clothing manufacturer. However, the research also highlights the significant environmental challenge posed by this output, noting that China's textile waste recovery rate is only 17 percent, with most of it being downcycled into lower-quality products.</p>

Others, however, voiced hope that the high-level meeting in their home state could finally lead to a peaceful resolution of the devastating conflict. The summit's location in Alaska, once a Russian territory, adds a unique historical context to the event.</p>

Rooney suggests that it will be very difficult for Isak to stay at the club, given the "huge opportunity" to join Premier League champions Liverpool, who have reportedly made a substantial offer. He also noted that due to financial regulations, selling the player might paradoxically benefit Newcastle by freeing up funds to strengthen the overall squad, even at the cost of losing their top talent.</p>

The initiative involves female police officers running in plain clothes in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators.

The operation aims to gather better data on this under-reported issue and make public spaces safer for women.</p>
