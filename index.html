          <p>A new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reveals that global military expenditure reached a record high of over $2.7 trillion in 2024, a 9.4% increase from 2023. This surge is primarily driven by the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, with Europe and the Middle East experiencing significant increases. Germany now ranks fourth globally in military spending after increasing its budget by 28% due to a special fund for the Bundeswehr. The US remains the top spender, focusing on modernizing its military capabilities to maintain an advantage over Russia and China.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which sank in 1710. Investigations of timbers, bricks, and clay pipes found during underwater excavations confirmed their identity, dispelling previous assumptions that they were pirate ships. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum conducted the excavation in 2023, revealing that one ship was burned and the other wrecked. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but did not abolish until 1847.</p>

          <p>A report by a leading health think tank, the Health Foundation, indicates that urgent and emergency care services in England are performing significantly worse than before the pandemic. A&E waiting times have reached record highs, with over 60,000 people waiting 12 hours or more for admission in January. The report highlights persistent issues with discharging patients fit to leave, exacerbating bottlenecks and ambulance handover delays. While flu cases were higher than usual, the report argues that blaming external factors offers a false sense of comfort and calls for addressing the underlying issues within the health service.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has dismissed suggestions that reaching the FA Cup final indicates a successful season, emphasizing the importance of winning the Premier League. Guardiola stated that the club must make the right decisions for the next season to improve. A City player believes the team is moving in the right direction after a faltering mid-season form and that they have a chance of a trophy now and hopefully be in the top four to take into next season.</p>
