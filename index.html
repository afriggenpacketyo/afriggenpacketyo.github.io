          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new AI Action Plan to ensure U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 federal actions, such as expediting data center construction, supporting semiconductor plants, and updating the electric grid. It also aims to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems by setting new rules for government contractors and compel federal agencies to repeal regulations that hinder AI development. The initiative, championed by Trump's AI Czar David Sacks, seeks to bolster the nation's competitive edge against countries like China.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has been sentenced to four consecutive life sentences for the murders of four University of Idaho students. During the sentencing, Judge Steven Hippler called Kohberger a "coward" and noted that the motive for the "unfathomable and senseless act of evil" may never be revealed. Prosecutors explained they did not compel Kohberger to provide a motive as part of his plea deal, expressing doubt that he would tell the truth. The White House also commented, expressing sympathy for the victims' families and frustration over the lack of a known motive.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Florida has rejected a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury records related to the 2005 and 2007 federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg stated her "hands are tied" by existing legal precedent in the Eleventh Circuit, which strictly limits the disclosure of such materials. Rosenberg faulted the Justice Department for not providing sufficient legal arguments to justify making an exception to the secrecy rules. This ruling is a setback for the DOJ's efforts to release more information in the high-profile case.</p>

To navigate this, Hershey plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its strategy to become a broader "snacking powerhouse."</p>

          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow a large sum like $100,000, a home equity loan is currently a significantly cheaper option than a personal loan due to lower interest rates. With average home equity loan rates around 8.3-8.4% and personal loan rates near 12.65%, the savings are substantial. Over a 15-year term, for example, choosing a home equity loan could save a borrower over $47,000 in total interest compared to a personal loan. While both offer fixed rates, the secured nature of a home equity loan allows for more favorable borrowing terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The opening day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford was marked by a significant injury to Indian wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. Pant retired hurt after being struck on the foot while batting, a blow to India's efforts on a hard-fought day. Before the injury, India had reached a score of 264-4, with notable contributions from Sai Sudharsan and Yashasvi Jaiswal. England, having won the toss and chosen to field, saw captain Ben Stokes take two key wickets, keeping the match tightly balanced as India awaits the results of Pant's scan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the profits from selling a primary residence. This move, which Trump suggested could boost the housing market, would remove a tax currently levied on profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for joint filers. The idea follows the introduction of a similar bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who argues it would help homeowners, especially seniors, and address housing shortages. However, tax policy experts suggest that a complete elimination is unlikely and that raising the existing exemption thresholds is a more probable outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commentary piece from NPR argues that Paramount's decision to cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is a significant error. The cancellation of the popular late-night program was announced by CBS last week. The article contends that by ending the show, Paramount is silencing one of its most effective and critical voices. This move is seen as a misstep that not only fails to appreciate the show's value but also dilutes the network's own future broadcast potential.</p>

          <p>A review of the Bregenz Festival in Austria praises the event's ambition, particularly its spectacular lakeside opera productions. This year's main outdoor attraction is a flamboyant staging of Carl Maria von Weber’s “Die Freischütz,” featuring a massive, gothic-inspired set on a stage built directly on Lake Constance. In contrast, the festival also presented a powerful, more conventional production of George Enescu’s rarely performed opera “Oedipe” indoors. The article notes the festival's large scale and budget, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors, but also mentions a looming 30% cut in government funding.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union are reportedly close to finalizing a trade agreement that would impose a 15% tariff on most goods imported from the EU. This rate would mirror a recent deal made with Japan but would be higher than the 10% baseline tariff agreed upon with the United Kingdom. While some products like aircraft and medical devices may be exempt, the deal would be a blow to sectors like the German auto industry. In response to the negotiations, the EU is also preparing retaliatory measures, threatening nearly €100 billion in tariffs on U.S. imports if a deal is not reached.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street expecting an 11% year-over-year drop in revenue following a reported 14% decline in vehicle deliveries.

To counter this, Musk has been heavily promoting Tesla's future in autonomous robotaxis and humanoid robots.

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is facing criticism for his contradictory positions on Medicaid, after voting for a major Republican bill that includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to the program. For months, Hawley had been a vocal opponent of such cuts, calling them "morally wrong and politically suicidal." Shortly after voting for the bill, he introduced separate legislation to repeal some of its deepest Medicaid reductions. This has led Democrats to accuse him of political maneuvering, while some analysts suggest he is attempting to balance loyalty to President Trump with his own populist branding ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>A massive and dangerous heat dome is spreading across a large portion of the United States, bringing temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit to millions of Americans. Scientists explain that a heat dome is a high-pressure system that sinks and compresses air, causing it to heat up while also suppressing cloud formation. This phenomenon is exacerbated by high humidity, which makes it harder for the human body to cool down, and by climate change, which makes such events more intense and longer-lasting. Nighttime temperatures are also remaining unusually high, increasing the health risks for vulnerable populations without access to air conditioning.</p>
