          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide at age 55, experienced failings in his mental healthcare in the months before his death. The court heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive him to be in a crisis situation, despite his wife reporting that he was asking for help to end his life. While the coroner noted shortcomings in the care provided by the NHS Foundation Trust, they did not constitute gross misconduct. Thorpe’s widow stated the family will continue to raise awareness for mental health issues.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price fell by 9% following announcements of significant cost-cutting measures for its struggling foundry business, overshadowing a better-than-expected earnings report. The company revealed it is axing facility projects in Germany and Poland and may discontinue the foundry business if it fails to secure a major customer for its next-generation 14A chip process. CEO Lip-Bu Tan acknowledged that the company had "invested too much, too soon," leading to an underutilized factory footprint. These strategic shifts aim to stabilize the business but have introduced new uncertainties for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Alabama football coach Nick Saban has publicly praised an executive order signed by President Donald Trump aimed at regulating payments to college athletes. The order seeks to crack down on "pay-to-play" arrangements while preserving the educational model of college sports. Saban expressed his support, stating the move helps differentiate legitimate name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals from payments that could disrupt competitive balance. The order also emphasizes protecting women's and non-revenue sports, a point Saban highlighted as crucial for maintaining opportunities for all student-athletes.</p>

          <p>A massive heat dome is creating hazardous weather conditions for more than 100 million people as it moves eastward across the United States. The National Weather Service has issued heat advisories from Maine to North Carolina, with heat index values expected to feel 10 to 15 degrees above average. This prolonged heatwave, characterized by high humidity and minimal overnight relief, poses significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations. The phenomenon is exacerbated in some agricultural areas by "corn sweat," which can further increase humidity levels.</p>

If an agreement is not reached, the administration has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from the EU.

The piece highlights the secrecy surrounding the itinerary and contrasts the personal nature of the visit with the high cost to taxpayers for security and travel.

For months, the president has publicly called for such easing of monetary policy. While the White House has maintained pressure on the Fed, both sides characterized the recent meeting with a more conciliatory tone, though administration officials still advocate for a broad review of the central bank's operations.

          <p>President Trump's visit to Scotland is being overshadowed by new revelations regarding his connection to the late Jeffrey Epstein. Reports indicate Trump's name appeared on a contributor list for a book celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday, adding to the controversy over his relationship with the convicted sex offender. The president has denied contributing a sexually suggestive note and drawing, suing The Wall Street Journal for its report. Meanwhile, Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell is meeting with a top Justice Department official, though Trump stated he has not considered granting her clemency.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed he is launching a new political party to challenge the current political establishment. The yet-unnamed party plans to contest local elections in May ahead of the next general election. Polling suggests the new entity could capture a significant portion of the left-wing vote, potentially impacting the performance of both the Labour and Green parties. The move could further fragment the UK's political landscape, with Corbyn's allies indicating a willingness to form electoral pacts with the Greens to maximize their influence.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is bracing for disruption as thousands of resident doctors have started a five-day strike over pay. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the walkout will be challenging but stated efforts are underway to minimize its impact and keep as many services running as possible. The British Medical Association (BMA) and the government failed to reach an agreement, leading to the 12th strike since March 2023. While the NHS has urged patients to attend appointments unless cancelled, the BMA has warned of staff being stretched thin.</p>

          <p>According to Wharton associate professor Ethan Mollick, artificial intelligence is not yet at a stage where it can fully replace human jobs, but it will be a major concern for the entry-level workforce. He argues that while AI can handle specific tasks, it lacks the comprehensive ability to substitute for a complete human role. Mollick emphasizes that as AI automates routine tasks, developing deep expertise, judgment, and curiosity will become more critical than ever. He suggests that companies must rethink entry-level positions as training grounds for future senior employees, rather than just for task completion.</p>

          <p>President Trump deflected questions about his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, stating he has "nothing to do with the guy" and shifting focus to other public figures who associated with him. When asked about a potential pardon for convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, Trump said it is something he is allowed to do but has "not thought about." His comments came as a top Justice Department official was set to meet with Maxwell for a second day. Maxwell's lawyer stated she was answering all questions and that the interview was an opportunity to finally share what really happened.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has asserted that Hamas "didn't really want to make a deal" following the withdrawal of U.S. and Israeli negotiators from ceasefire talks in Qatar. This collapse in negotiations leaves the fate of the remaining hostages uncertain, with both the U.S. and Israel now considering "alternative options." Hamas expressed surprise at the negative turn, stating it remains keen to continue negotiations.

          <p>England's Premier League is experiencing an unprecedented summer of transfer spending, dominated by the top clubs from last season. Liverpool currently leads the spending with an outlay of £269 million on new players, including a potential British record fee for Florian Wirtz. Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester City have also spent well over £100 million each to strengthen their squads for the upcoming season. This concentration of spending at the top raises questions about the league's competitiveness, contrasting with a period just months ago when smaller clubs were challenging for top positions.

This downturn contrasts sharply with record-high levels of personal wealth and soaring stock markets, breaking a long-standing correlation.

The junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, cited insecurity and economic hardship to justify the takeover, but many problems have worsened. The new leadership has forced many NGOs to cease operations, leading to job losses, and has cracked down on media and civil society, with rights groups reporting arbitrary detentions and a high level of intolerance. With the junta leader sworn in for a five-year term, a return to democratic rule appears unlikely in the near future.</p>

The move puts pressure on key allies, particularly the United Kingdom, to follow suit. Traditionally, the UK has viewed recognition as a final step in a peace process, not a trigger for one, and has been cautious of upsetting the U.S. and Israel. However, the British government now faces considerable political pressure from its own MPs and cabinet members to act, creating a complex decision for its foreign policy.</p>
