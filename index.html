          <p>Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, pardoned by President Trump, now represents the interests of Milorad Dodik, the "Bosnian Bear," who has ties to Vladimir Putin.  Blagojevich's firm, RRB Strategies LLC, will provide communications support for the Republic of Srpska, a Serb-majority region in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This new role comes amidst ongoing ethnic tensions in the region and Dodik's advocacy for Srpska's separation from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Blagojevich's actions have drawn criticism from U.S. officials concerned about Dodik's destabilizing behavior.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared "Liberation Day" and announced a 10% tariff on all imported goods, along with higher tariffs on nations deemed "worst offenders."  These reciprocal tariffs, ranging from 20% for the EU to 34% for China, aim to address perceived trade imbalances.  Economists warn of potential inflation and economic slowdown, while some countries may retaliate, escalating the global trade conflict. The move has been met with mixed reactions, both domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams with prejudice.  The Department of Justice requested the dismissal, citing concerns about the case's impact on Adams' ability to govern and cooperate with the Trump administration.  The dismissal prevents Adams from being retried on the same charges.  The decision has sparked debate and criticism, with some questioning the reasons for the dismissal.</p>

          <p>A scientific analysis of 'Married at First Sight' reveals surprisingly low success rates.  Only a small percentage of couples remain together after the show, far lower than the average marriage duration.  The study suggests that marrying a stranger is a high-risk endeavor, potentially influenced by the show's format and lack of legal marriage in the Australian version.  The findings highlight the challenges of forming lasting relationships under such circumstances.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced two new tariff types on "Liberation Day": a universal 10% import duty and reciprocal tariffs on 60 countries.  These reciprocal tariffs aim to equalize trade imbalances, but economists predict increased inflation.  The tariffs' effectiveness in boosting domestic manufacturing is debated, with potential for retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The announcement has generated significant economic and political discussion.</p>
