          <p>An investigation details how the Trump Organization has significantly expanded its international business projects since Donald Trump returned to office, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. The article highlights new deals in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, and Vietnam, often involving entities with close ties to their respective governments. These business ventures frequently coincide with official diplomatic trips and major policy decisions, such as a historic defense deal with Saudi Arabia. The report scrutinizes the blurred lines between presidential duties and private financial gain, contrasting with the Trump Organization's claims of restraint.</p>

          <p>China and the European Union are reportedly close to resolving their dispute over electric vehicle tariffs, with technical negotiations largely complete. According to Chinese state-affiliated media, the final agreement now depends on the "political will" of the EU. The report suggests that the core technical aspects have been settled, shifting the focus to the political decision-making required to finalize the deal. This development comes amid ongoing trade tensions, as the EU has been investigating Chinese subsidies and other trade practices it considers market-distorting.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Mainstream Media Prioritizes Professional Identity Over Patriotism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 08:00:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from Fox News contends that many journalists in the broadcast media demonstrate a bias against expressing patriotism, viewing it as a compromise of their professional neutrality. The author traces this sentiment back to media opposition to the Vietnam War, citing historical examples involving prominent journalists like Walter Cronkite and Peter Jennings. The piece argues that this perceived disdain for national pride alienates the public and contributes to a lack of trust in the media. It suggests that for some in the profession, the power to sway public opinion has become more important than national unity.</p>

          <p>The British monarchy continues its tradition of granting Royal Warrants, a prestigious seal of approval for goods and services, with the Prince and Princess of Wales set to begin issuing them next year.

          <p>Eight member nations of the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to increase their collective oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August, exceeding initial expectations. This decision, which includes major producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia, is part of a gradual reversal of previous voluntary supply cuts. The OPEC Secretariat cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories, as the basis for the accelerated production hike. The move aims to balance market supply amid rising summer demand and recent geopolitical tensions that had briefly elevated oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

This has involved close coordination with FIFA and Democratic-led host cities, which are set to receive federal funding for security despite other political conflicts.

          <p>The article profiles Reverend William Barber and his revived Poor People's Campaign, a national "fusion movement" using nonviolent moral protest to challenge systemic poverty and injustice. It details a recent "Moral Monday" protest in Washington D.C., where a diverse group of activists demonstrated against proposed budget cuts to healthcare and food assistance, which Barber terms "policy murder." The movement draws on a tradition of religious protest, framing the fight for economic justice as a sacred obligation to confront a political theology that harms the poor.

Additionally, rising land prices are making it difficult for farmers to compete with developers, while a lack of both local and migrant labor threatens the entire specialty crop supply chain.

These crucial anti-tumor cells often become depleted as cancer progresses, and the study indicates that sildenafil could help reverse this process and restore their function.

          <p>Turkish authorities have detained three more mayors from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), continuing a widespread crackdown that has targeted hundreds of party members. The mayors of Adana, Antalya, and Adiyaman were detained on allegations of extortion, according to prosecutors. This follows the high-profile arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in March and the recent detention of the former mayor of Izmir. The CHP asserts that the investigations are politically motivated and designed to neutralize the party's growing challenge to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rule, a claim the government denies.</p>

          <p>Demonstrators gathered in Mexico City to protest against rising living costs and gentrification, which they attribute to an influx of foreigners, particularly remote workers from the United States. Organizers stated that the government's policies favor those with higher purchasing power, leading to the displacement of local populations who have lived in their neighborhoods for decades. The influx has caused rents to surge by 47% in five years, making housing unaffordable for many residents. Protesters are calling for better regulation of migration and for new arrivals to contribute more to the local community.</p>

It gathers anecdotes from various professionals, both men and women, who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal issues. Executive coaches and career experts argue that showing emotion is no longer seen as unprofessional and that emotional intelligence is a strength. They suggest that employers who show compassion and support for their staff are more likely to foster a motivated and happier workforce, challenging the old-fashioned view that professionalism requires suppressing all emotion.</p>

Vance has also been a key defender of Trump's foreign policy decisions, including strikes on Iran, despite his previous non-interventionist stance.

Her appointment has alarmed public health experts, who point to her decades of work with the National Vaccine Information Center, an organization central to the modern anti-vaccine movement.

          <p>Writing from Tehran, a social researcher describes how the recent 12-day Israeli attack has shifted public opinion in Iran. While many Iranians dislike their government, the strikes on civilians and the West's supportive response have fostered a renewed sense of patriotism and unity around the "homeland." The author argues that the West's perceived double standards and hypocrisy have destroyed any remaining trust, leading some ordinary Iranians to now support the idea of a nuclear deterrent. This has damaged the West's moral standing and disqualified it as a credible peace broker in the eyes of many in the region.</p>

          <p>Democrats believe President Trump's recently passed tax-and-spending legislation provides them with a strong campaign message for the 2026 midterm elections. They plan to focus on the bill's nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which they are framing as a "cruel" attack on the healthcare of millions of Americans. Polling indicates that Medicaid is a very popular program, and previous elections have shown that healthcare can be a potent issue for voters. While Republicans will argue the bill was necessary to prevent tax increases, Democrats hope the tangible impact of the cuts will resonate more strongly with the electorate.

The author, a former MMA commentator, draws parallels between Trump's use of the sport and how authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin leverage it to project strength and machismo. The article contends that Trump's long-standing relationship with the UFC and its CEO, Dana White, has helped him cultivate a strongman image and blend confrontational politics with entertainment. This spectacle is presented as a symptom of a broader shift towards a political culture that celebrates loyalty, masculinity, and violence.</p>
