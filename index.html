          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited a Christian village in the occupied West Bank to show solidarity after an arson attack on an ancient church. The attack in early July damaged the ruins of the Byzantine-era Church of Saint George in Taybeh, with local residents blaming Israeli settlers amid soaring regional violence. Huckabee condemned the act as a sacrilege and insisted that the perpetrators must be found and prosecuted, not just reprimanded. His visit comes during a period of increased tensions and deadly incidents in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>The viral video of an executive's controversial moment at a Coldplay concert has crossed over into the sports world, drawing a witty comment from an MLB broadcaster. During a Texas Rangers game, Detroit Tigers announcer Jason Benetti made a joke referencing the incident when pitcher Chris Martin, who shares a name with Coldplay's singer, took the mound. The original video showed Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and his head of HR awkwardly hiding from the 'kiss cam,' which ultimately led to Byron's resignation.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating the death of a 61-year-old man who was fatally injured after being pulled into an active MRI machine in Westbury, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room, and the machine's powerful magnetic field drew him into it, resulting in a medical episode. He died from his injuries the following day. The FDA warns that the strong magnetic fields of MRI machines can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles, highlighting the critical need for careful screening.</p>

          <p>A newly released photograph suggests that China's next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter, the Shenyang J-35, may have entered low-rate initial production and service with the People's Liberation Army Navy. The image shows two J-35s with official construction numbers and naval aviation markings, indicating they are likely production models rather than prototypes. This development signals a significant advancement for China's naval aviation capabilities, paving the way for the fighter's future operations aboard its newest aircraft carriers.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, led by German army officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The bombing at the Wolf's Lair headquarters failed, and the subsequent coup attempt, known as "Operation Valkyrie," was quickly suppressed, leading to the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. While initially viewed as traitors, the plotters are now largely remembered as heroes, though their complex motivations and the late timing of their resistance remain subjects of historical debate.</p>

          <p>A driver in Orange County, Florida, has become the first person to be jailed under the state's stringent new "Super Speeder" law. The law, which took effect on July 1, classifies driving over 100 mph or 50 mph above the speed limit as a major offense. The man was arrested just minutes after the law went into effect for allegedly driving 104 mph. A first offense under this new legislation can result in up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Tennessee plastics factory where six workers died during flooding from Hurricane Helene last year will not face criminal charges. A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation probe found no evidence that employees at Impact Plastics were forced to stay, concluding the case. The workers died after being swept away by floodwaters when they sought refuge on a semitrailer outside the building. While the criminal case is closed, the company still faces a wrongful death lawsuit from a victim's family.</p>

          <p>Following significant public and political pressure, Donald Trump has requested the Department of Justice to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. This move comes as lawmakers from both parties have demanded more transparency regarding the late financier's sex trafficking case. Simultaneously, Trump has filed a major lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for a story about him and Epstein, while also labeling those pushing for the file release as "troublemakers."</p>
