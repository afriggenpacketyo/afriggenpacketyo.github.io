          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in Veracruz, Mexico, resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. The unrest reportedly began due to inmate anger over extortion and abuse by the Grupo Sombra criminal organization, which has a significant presence within the facility. This event highlights the systemic issues plaguing Mexico's penitentiary system, including overcrowding and the control of prisons by cartels and gangs. The Tuxpan prison, designed for 735 inmates, was holding 778 at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>Inspired by lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones to improve their survival rates against missile attacks. The concept involves equipping small or medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters for last-second, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers. According to simulations published in a Chinese defense journal, this system could dramatically increase a drone's ability to survive an attack to nearly 90%. The innovation aims to make the drone's final movements too abrupt and unpredictable for missile tracking systems to follow.</p>

          <p>A 51-year-old woman has died and another was seriously injured after being mauled by multiple dogs at Perris Hill Park in San Bernardino, California. Police responded to the chaotic scene and, while assisting one victim, were charged by two more dogs, prompting an officer to shoot and kill one of them. The deceased victim, Teodora Mendoza, was found nearby with severe injuries and later died at a hospital. Authorities from San Bernardino Animal Control have since removed a total of 14 dogs, believed to be strays, from the park as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed an international network, with members in the UK, that produces and shares graphic videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. Operating on encrypted messaging apps, these groups have thousands of members and are believed to upload new torture videos approximately every 14 hours. Evidence shows UK-based members discussing adopting kittens from shelters for the purpose of abuse, highlighting the extreme cruelty involved. The network, which originated in China, even promoted a "100 cat kill" competition, and authorities are investigating links to recent animal cruelty cases in London.</p>

          <p>Avril Benoit, the CEO of Doctors Without Borders USA, detailed the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza during an interview, describing catastrophic injuries and widespread starvation. She explained that aid distribution sites have become scenes of chaos and violence, with civilians being shot, crushed, or trampled. When the ABC host shifted the focus to a video of a malnourished Israeli hostage released by Hamas, calling its airing a "war crime," Benoit paused before reaffirming that Israel's control over aid is starving everyone, including hostages. She emphasized that U.S. backing of these policies makes it complicit in the unfolding tragedy.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade negotiations, China has firmly rejected a U.S. demand to cease purchasing oil from Russia and Iran, a key point of contention for the Trump administration. The U.S. threatened a 100% tariff if China does not comply, but Beijing stated it will secure its energy supply based on its national interests and will not yield to coercion. This stance underscores China's strategy of playing hardball on issues linking trade to its energy and foreign policy. Despite this friction, officials on both sides have expressed optimism about reaching a broader trade deal to stabilize economic ties. (not investment advice)</p>

The 4CMenB vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, will be offered first to high-risk groups, primarily gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple partners or STIs. With over 85,000 cases recorded in 2023, doctors hope the vaccine, which is 30-40% effective, will prevent up to 100,000 new cases over the next decade. The program is seen as a crucial new tool in public health, especially in combating the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains.</p>

Ramsey argues that by servicing these debts, people are enriching lenders instead of securing their own economic future. He advocates for a strict financial plan that includes a zero-based budget, aggressive debt repayment using the "debt snowball" method, and paying for purchases with cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck the region, leading seismologists to believe the seismic waves may have triggered the event. While the volcano was likely near eruption already, the quake could have provided the final push. The area is sparsely populated, and no communities are currently threatened, but an aviation alert was issued for aircraft in the vicinity.</p>

          <p>A massive rat, measuring over 22 inches from nose to tail and described as "almost the size of a small cat," was discovered inside a home in North Yorkshire, England. Local councilors shared a photo of the rodent to raise awareness of what they call a growing problem in the area, stating this is not an isolated incident. They noted that after a period of effective pest control two years ago, the rats have returned in even greater numbers. The alarming discovery has made national headlines, with local officials hoping the attention will spur definitive action to address the infestation.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a jobs report showed downward revisions for previous months. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, while Trump claimed the numbers were "rigged." The firing drew sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warned it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent. Critics argue the administration is "shooting the messenger" for weak economic news and attempting to "cook the books" for political gain. (not investment advice)</p>

The activist group Palestine Action, which has since been proscribed as a terrorist organization by the government, claimed responsibility for the incident where two RAF Voyager planes were spray-painted. The 22-year-old suspect faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place. This follows the charging of four others last month as the investigation into the protest action continues.</p>

          <p>A powerful cold front has swept across eastern Australia, blanketing parts of northern New South Wales with up to 16 inches of snow, the most significant snowfall since the mid-1980s.

While the snow created picturesque scenes, the wild weather system also caused widespread disruption, including flooding, building damage, and power outages for tens of thousands of homes. Emergency services responded to over 1,400 incidents, including rescuing people from vehicles stranded in snow and floodwaters.</p>

The suspect, identified as Michael Paul Brown, was reportedly a regular at the bar and lived next door. Authorities have described him as unstable and dangerous, widening their search into the dense national forest land surrounding the town and offering a reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent court filing, Trump administration lawyers denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements from White House officials. Reports and a statement from adviser Stephen Miller in May had indicated a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However, the Justice Department's filing in a lawsuit claims that no such directive or policy has been issued to ICE. This discrepancy arises as the administration defends itself against accusations of unconstitutional immigration sweeps and vows to carry out a large-scale deportation operation.</p>
