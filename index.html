          <p>Moody's Ratings lowered the United States' credit rating from AAA to Aa1, citing concerns over increasing government debt and high interest rates. The ratings agency highlighted the failure of successive administrations to address large fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. This decision aligns Moody's with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which had previously downgraded the U.S. credit rating. The news caused a slight increase in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield in after-hours trading, reflecting investor concern about the nation's financial stability.</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court prolonged an injunction that temporarily prevents the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court sent the case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the time afforded to detainees to contest their removals. The majority stated that the government did not provide sufficient time or information for migrants to challenge their cases. The justices did not rule on the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act, but Justices Alito and Thomas dissented.</p>

          <p>Conservatives on the House Budget Committee blocked a megabill intended to advance President Trump's domestic agenda, citing concerns that the legislation would increase the deficit. The bill aimed to make Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Conservatives are demanding deeper cuts to federal spending, including earlier implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients and the immediate elimination of clean energy tax credits. The committee planned to reconvene to reconsider the legislation.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway for nine inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail, with authorities believing they had inside help. One inmate has been captured, and the remaining escapees are considered "armed and dangerous." The inmates are believed to have escaped after yanking a sliding jail cell door off the track and breaching a wall behind the toilet. Police are asking the public to notify them if they were victims or witnesses in the escapees' trials.</p>

          <p>A controversy arose after former F.B.I. Director James Comey posted an Instagram photo with shells spelling "86 47," leading to accusations from Trump administration officials that it was a call for the president's assassination. While the term "86" originated as diner slang for being out of something, it has evolved to mean eliminate or kill in some contexts. Lexicologists argue that without specific context, it's preposterous to assume Comey was suggesting violence. The incident highlights the slippery nature of slang and the ongoing tension between Trump and Comey.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is considering a deal in which Boeing would avoid criminal responsibility for its role in two deadly 737 Max crashes. The agreement would involve Boeing paying into a victims fund but not pleading guilty to any charges. This potential deal is a shift from a previous agreement where Boeing was expected to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud the federal government. Lawyers for the families of the victims expressed deep disappointment and vowed to fight the deal in court.</p>

          <p>A woman facing a second-degree murder charge for the death of a television reporter who traveled to New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl in February was sentenced to 25 years in an unrelated case on Thursday. Danette Colbert, 48, had previously been given a suspended sentence by a New Orleans state court judge last year after being convicted of theft and fraud charges.
