          <p>A recent poll indicates that more Americans disapprove of President Trump's handling of immigration than approve. The President met with advisors in the Situation Room to discuss options regarding Iran after leaving the G7 summit early due to tensions in the Middle East. Senate Republicans are working on changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by the House to fund Trump's domestic agenda. This bill aims to address various aspects of President Trump's domestic agenda and is currently undergoing revisions in the Senate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld a Tennessee law restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, effectively limiting such treatments in half of the country. The court rejected a challenge from the Biden administration, families, and a physician, arguing the law violated the Constitution's equal protection guarantee. The Tennessee law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under 18. This ruling marks the first time the Supreme Court has weighed in on the debate over healthcare for transgender youth, a topic that has become a flashpoint in the culture wars.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned the U.S. that military intervention in the conflict with Israel would result in "irreparable damage." Khamenei stated that U.S. involvement would backfire and cause greater harm to the U.S. than to Iran. This warning comes amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with both countries exchanging missile fire, and the U.S. attempting to broker a deal over Iran's nuclear program. President Trump has cautioned that U.S. patience is "wearing thin" and demanded Iran's "UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!"</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the stereotype that straight men are "bad" at gossip and delves into the reasons behind this perception. It challenges the assumption that men don't gossip, citing a 2019 study that found men and women gossip positively and negatively at similar rates. The article suggests that men's perceived lack of skill in gossiping stems from a lack of cultural opportunities to freely engage in social talk and storytelling. The article posits that men's hesitancy to gossip openly may be linked to fears of appearing "messy" or incriminating themselves, contributing to a broader "loneliness crisis" among men.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store nuclear waste in the state. Justice Kavanaugh wrote the 6-3 decision stating that Texas and the land developer were not parties in the commission's licensing proceeding and therefore cannot seek judicial review. The case revolved around Interim Storage Partners' license to store 5,000 to 40,000 metric tons of nuclear waste in Andrews County, Texas, with the state raising concerns about storing spent nuclear fuel above the Permian Basin.</p>

Iowa has the second-highest cancer rate in the nation, with residents blaming insecticides, herbicides, and high nitrate levels in the water supply. The research will examine links between cancer and pesticides, nitrates, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAs) found in farm fertilizer. The study's focus on agriculture is controversial due to the industry's significant contribution to the state's economy, but researchers aim to inform policies that can help reduce cancer rates.</p>

          <p>China is likely to remain cautious about intervening in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, even if the U.S. engages militarily. The Chinese foreign ministry expressed "serious concerns" over the escalating conflict and urged countries with "special influence" over Israel to play a "constructive role" in easing tensions. Beijing, which has close ties with Tehran, has also said that it is willing to broker peace between Iran and Israel. The U.S. President has reportedly considered military action to target Iran’s nuclear facilities, demanding Iran's "unconditional surrender".</p>

It highlights that leading CD accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate, providing an opportunity to lock in high rates for the CD's term. Strategies include considering online banks, which often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and exploring short-term CDs, which may have higher interest rates than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs is also suggested as a practical approach to balance short-term gains with long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

The heat is attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where temperatures could reach close to 40C in parts of France and Spain.
