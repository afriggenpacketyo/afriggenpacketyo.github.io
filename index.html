        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent vow to remove homeless encampments from Washington, D.C., has alarmed advocacy groups. The plan involves moving unhoused individuals to unspecified locations "FAR from the Capital," but lacks concrete details on resources, transportation, or legal rights. Advocates from organizations like Miriam's Kitchen and the National Coalition for the Homeless fear the policy is a counterproductive "stunt" that disconnects people from essential services and support networks. They argue that without providing affordable housing, such clearings simply displace individuals to new locations, failing to address the root causes of homelessness.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to allow Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its advanced Blackwell AI chip to China. The potential deal would require a significant performance reduction, with Trump suggesting a 30% to 50% decrease in capability. This move follows an agreement where Nvidia and AMD pay the U.S. government a 15% share of revenue from Chinese chip sales for export licenses. The strategy aims to keep China dependent on American technology while preventing it from accessing cutting-edge hardware for AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

Hathaleen, who co-created the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land" about settler violence, was a globally respected advocate for his community.

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in vacancies to 718,000 between May and July. The number of employees on payrolls also saw a slight decrease, marking the tenth decline in the past twelve months, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors. Despite the slowdown, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.7%, and average wage growth remained at 5%. Economists suggest this indicates a gradual cooling rather than a sharp downturn, which may influence the Bank of England's future decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the concept of "abroad" is obsolete in an age of hypersonic missiles, making President Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin critically important. It frames the world's geopolitical structure around four superpowers: the U.S. and Israel versus China and Russia. The author praises Trump's realism and toughness, suggesting he is well-equipped to negotiate with Putin without succumbing to illusions. The piece posits that a successful outcome in Ukraine, building on Trump's other foreign policy achievements, is vital for Western security and that hoping for his failure is unpatriotic.</p>

          <p>The UFC has secured a $7.7 billion media deal with Paramount, moving away from a pure pay-per-view model to broaden its audience. This strategic shift occurs as an analysis questions whether UFC President Dana White's strong public alliance with Donald Trump could be a liability for the globally diverse brand. The article notes that the UFC's fanbase and roster are more international and politically varied than often stereotyped. With Trump's approval ratings fluctuating and younger demographics being politically independent, the close association with a polarizing figure might alienate as many fans as it attracts.</p>

          <p>A controversial federal dredging project in Alabama's Mobile Bay has united an unusual coalition of shrimpers, environmentalists, property owners, and politicians. They oppose the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' practice of disposing of dredged material from the ship channel directly back into the bay. Critics, including local fishermen, argue this "mud dumping" is harming the ecosystem, choking marine life, and devastating the local seafood industry. While the Corps maintains the practice is environmentally sound and necessary for port operations, the coalition is lobbying Congress to ban it and promote alternative uses like coastal restoration.</p>

Dial-up worked by converting computer data into audio signals over phone lines, a process that was slow and prevented simultaneous phone use.

          <p>President Trump announced a federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police, deploying the National Guard to target what he described as "violent gangs," "roving mobs of wild youth," and "drugged-out maniacs." The rhetoric also included plans to purge homeless and poor people from the capital, sparking criticism that the approach conflates complex social issues with criminality. Experts and local residents express skepticism, arguing that using aggressive police tactics and displacing vulnerable groups could be devastating and counterproductive.

          <p>The controversial technology behind gene-editing human embryos is reportedly getting a reboot, years after a Chinese scientist's secret creation of the first gene-edited babies sparked global condemnation. In 2018, He Jiankui's use of the new CRISPR technique was deemed reckless and unethical by the scientific community. Now, some companies are once again exploring quests to advance gene-editing technology for human reproduction. This renewed interest raises significant ethical questions and revisits the debate over the boundaries of genetic modification in humans.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened "immediate legal action" against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to reach the top spot, specifically citing the ranking of his xAI's Grok chatbot. The threat is the latest development in Musk's ongoing feud with OpenAI, which he co-founded and is now suing. This is not the first antitrust challenge for Apple, which was sued by the U.S. Department of Justice last year over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, European Union leaders have collectively appealed to the U.S. President to defend European security and involve Ukraine in any potential peace agreement with Russia. The appeal, signed by all EU leaders except Hungary's Viktor Orban, expresses fear that Trump might agree to territorial concessions that would reward Russian aggression. The statement emphasizes that a just and lasting peace must uphold international law, including Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This comes as Ukraine reports it has recaptured several villages in the eastern Sumy region from Russian forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, pausing the escalation of tariffs for another 90 days until November 10. The move keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%, avoiding a significant hike. The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and what it calls unfair trade practices. Despite the pause, trade flows between the two economic giants have been significantly impacted this year, with U.S. imports from China down nearly 50% in June compared to the previous year.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, its lowest level since April 2023. Alongside the rate cut, the RBA downgraded its annual economic growth forecast for the country from 2.1% to 1.7%. The bank noted that inflation has dropped substantially since its 2022 peak, bringing demand and supply closer to balance. The decision comes amid a reshaped global trade environment and softer-than-expected domestic economic growth in the first quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia have experienced their most severe bleaching event ever recorded. The damage, spanning 1,500 kilometers, was caused by the state's "longest, largest and most intense" marine heatwave from last August to May. World-famous sites like the Ningaloo Reef, which had previously been less affected, were hit hard by the sustained heat stress. This event is part of a global bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures, underscoring the urgent threat that climate change poses to marine ecosystems worldwide.</p>

After her new boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to a fatal hit-and-run, he took her to the remote burial site in Argyll, Scotland. The girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, secretly dropped a can of Red Bull as a marker and later alerted the police, leading them directly to Parsons' body. McKellar and his twin brother had hit Parsons during a charity ride in 2017 and buried him instead of seeking help.</p>
