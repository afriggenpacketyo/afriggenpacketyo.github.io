          <p>At least four individuals lost their lives in Kyiv due to a recent Russian missile and drone assault, according to Ukraine's interior minister, Ihor Klymenko. The attack targeted residential areas, hospitals, and sports facilities, with the Shevchenkivskyi district being the most severely impacted, resulting in the destruction of an entire section of a high-rise building and leaving people trapped beneath rubble. In the Kyiv region, one woman was killed and two others were injured in the aerial attack, according to regional head Mykola Kalashnyk.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is set to reveal a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at reducing energy costs for over 7,000 UK businesses, potentially slashing bills by up to 25%. The plan includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, exempting manufacturers from certain green energy levies, and increasing discounts on network charges for energy-intensive firms. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the strategy as a turning point for Britain's economy, while critics raised concerns about the costs of net zero and the impact of the Employment Rights Bill on growth. The strategy also focuses on upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, and streamlining planning processes to boost innovation and create new jobs. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, as the U.S. pushes for greater financial commitment from its partners. The proposed spending includes 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some nations are on track to meet the 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago, others lag behind, raising concerns about whether these pledges will materialize into concrete action. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring these commitments, emphasizing the need for long-term government contracts to scale up production. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience, even outgrowing G7 nations in 2024, driven by military spending and stable oil exports redirected to China and India. However, rising inflation, high interest rates, and labor shortages are creating economic challenges, with some experts warning of a potential recession. While the unemployment rate remains low, analysts point to a period of stagnation as vital investment projects are reallocated to military spending. Sanctions continue to hinder technology imports and diversification, though they have not yet significantly impeded Russia's ability to wage war in the short term. </p>

Oil prices have already jumped, and analysts warn they could reach $100 a barrel if the Strait is closed and Western forces intervene.

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy, which combines intravenous ketamine infusions with psychotherapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists. Experts hope that making ketamine therapy available on the NHS will provide a more accessible option for patients with treatment-resistant depression. </p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the Israel-Iran conflict, global markets have largely shrugged off the escalation, with many strategists viewing the conflict as contained. The MSCI World index saw only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets traded mixed. Analysts suggest the market views the attack as a relief, reducing the nuclear threat in the region, with minimal risks of the conflict spreading. Traders are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government has signaled its support for U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, stating that the actions demonstrate Washington's resolve to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Japan hopes for a reopening of dialogue between the U.S. and Iran and vows to contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East.

          <p>Nesrine Malik critiques Western leaders' response to the Israel-Iran conflict, arguing that their calls for diplomacy are undermined by their refusal to address the root causes and their unwavering support for Israel. She argues that Western leaders are passengers in Israel's war, unable to challenge its wisdom or hold it accountable for violating international law. The article highlights a perceived hypocrisy in the West's treatment of Iran versus Israel, with Iran being held to a different standard of sovereignty and culpability. The author suggests that this approach reflects a broader erosion of political discourse and a disregard for human life. </p>

          <p>NATO's ambitious goals, including increased defense spending and troop numbers, pose significant challenges for Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, achieving the target of 5% of GDP for defense spending faces opposition within the coalition government. The Bundeswehr also needs to recruit tens of thousands of additional soldiers, with discussions ongoing about whether to reinstate conscription. Security experts emphasize the need for Germany to invest in its defense capabilities, given the threat posed by Russia, regardless of pressure from the United States. </p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending to deter Russia and appease U.S. President Donald Trump.

However, some countries, like Spain and Italy, are hesitant to commit to the spending targets.

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran, Adrian Clouatre, is struggling after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained his wife, Paola, who was still breastfeeding their three-month-old baby. Paola, a Mexican national, was detained during a green card meeting due to a deportation order issued in 2018 after her mother missed an immigration hearing. Immigration law experts say that the Trump administration's strict enforcement policies have reduced discretion for military families, with the federal agency tasked with helping military family members now referring them for deportation. Critics argue this policy is unfair to veterans and their families. </p>
