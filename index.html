          <p>During a protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the San Francisco Bay Area, law enforcement officers shot at a U-Haul truck that was reversing towards them outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. The driver, who reportedly ignored commands, fled the scene after the gunfire but later abandoned the vehicle nearby with multiple bullet holes. The incident occurred amidst day-long demonstrations where protesters, some of whom were detained, clashed with officers who deployed smoke grenades and flash bangs. The planned immigration surge was later called off by the president, but tensions remained high at the protest site.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed the existence of the Jinlin crater in China's Guangdong province, suggesting an asteroid struck the region approximately 10,000 years ago. This discovery marks only the fifth confirmed impact crater in China and the first to be identified in the country's southern region. Researchers estimate that the energy released from the impact was equivalent to about 600,000 tonnes of TNT, or roughly 40 atomic bombs. The findings were detailed in a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Matter and Radiation at Extremes, providing new insights into Earth's geological history.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Family Investment Offices Shift to Cash Amid Concerns Over Tariffs and Dollar Depreciation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that investment firms for ultra-wealthy families are growing more cautious, citing risks from U.S. tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and potential U.S. dollar depreciation. According to the poll by RBC Wealth Management, a majority of these family offices now see cash and liquid assets as offering the best returns over the next year, a significant shift from their previous focus on growth equities. Average portfolio return expectations for 2025 have been halved to 5%, with many prioritizing liquidity. This conservative stance is seen as a way to mitigate immediate risks while preparing to capitalize on future market opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rapidly demolished the historic East Wing of the White House to construct a new, privately funded $300 million ballroom. The century-old structure was torn down in a matter of days, sparking questions about the legality and ethics of the project, especially as it proceeded during a government shutdown without apparent review from key commissions. Critics note the move aligns with the president's tendency to reshape federal properties to his personal aesthetic, similar to his Mar-a-Lago resort. The project is being financed by private donors, including major tech companies and crypto investors, raising concerns about potential influence peddling.</p>

          <p>A key witness in a significant China spying case in the United Kingdom removed the word "enemy" from a witness statement, stating it did not align with the Conservative government's policy at the time. Deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins informed MPs that while the term was in a draft, he could not officially label China an enemy. This revelation comes as the current Labour government faces accusations of allowing the case against two accused spies to collapse. The director of public prosecutions has stated the case failed because evidence describing China as a national security threat could not be secured from the government.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has issued a preliminary finding that TikTok and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, have breached transparency obligations under the landmark Digital Services Act (DSA). The EU's executive arm accuses the tech giants of failing to provide researchers with adequate access to public data, which is crucial for scrutinizing the platforms' societal impacts. Meta was also cited for not offering users simple mechanisms to report illegal content or effectively challenge moderation decisions. If the findings are upheld, the companies could face fines of up to 6% of their global annual turnover.</p>

          <p>Sheffield Wednesday, a club in England's second-tier Championship football league, has filed a notice to be placed into administration following a winding-up petition from the UK's tax authority. This move will result in an automatic 12-point deduction, leaving the already last-place team further adrift from safety. The club has been plagued by financial issues, including late wage payments and multiple transfer embargoes, leading to widespread supporter protests against owner Dejphon Chansiri. Going into administration effectively ends Chansiri's tumultuous decade-long ownership of the historic club.</p>

          <p>A series of bear attacks in Japan on Friday resulted in one death and four injuries, contributing to a record year for deadly encounters with the animals. In Akita prefecture, a bear mauled four people, one of whom died, while a separate attack in the Toyama region injured a woman in her 70s. This year, nine people have been killed by bears, surpassing the previous record and prompting the government to vow tougher measures, including population management. Experts attribute the rise in attacks to factors like climate change impacting food sources and a declining human population in rural areas, leading to increased encroachment by bears into towns.</p>

          <p>Author Philip Pullman's new 'Book of Dust' trilogy, a companion to 'His Dark Materials,' delves into the concept of dangerous books and ideas, a theme that echoes the real-world controversy and banning campaigns his original series faced. The new books feature a conflict sparked by philosophical texts that cause the protagonist, Lyra, to become estranged from her soul. This narrative reflects Pullman's long-standing critique of dogma, particularly his opposition to C.S. Lewis's 'Chronicles of Narnia,' which he viewed as promoting harmful values. The article suggests that while Pullman opposes censorship, his new work affirms his belief that certain ideas can indeed be perilous.</p>

James has called the charges baseless and a politically motivated act of revenge by President Trump, whose organization she successfully prosecuted for civil fraud.

          <p>A court in Turkey has thrown out a corruption lawsuit against the country's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), ruling that the case lacked merit. The lawsuit had sought to nullify the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. The CHP has maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Erdoğan's government to undermine the opposition using the judiciary. The dismissal is seen as a potential easing of tensions after a year-long legal crackdown on the party, which made significant gains in last year's local elections.</p>

          <p>As a U.S. government shutdown continues, economists are debating its potential to tip the economy into a recession. Some experts warn that a prolonged impasse could create a vicious cycle, where furloughed workers exhaust savings and reduced consumer confidence chills economic activity, especially if it extends into the holiday season. However, other economists downplay the threat, arguing that most federal spending is on autopilot and the direct impact is limited to a relatively narrow part of the economy. The shutdown has also delayed the release of key federal economic data, creating uncertainty for both businesses and policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

Several prominent opposition figures, including his strongest challenger Tidjane Thiam, have been barred from the ballot, leading to accusations that the election is a mere "coronation."

However, steep new tariffs have caused exports to plummet, leading to factory slowdowns and threatening the livelihoods of workers who depend on meager but essential wages. The policy shift highlights the vulnerability of economies that have tethered their growth to the unpredictable trade policies of a single large partner.</p>

          <p>Israel's long-deferred 'E1' plan to build 3,400 new settlement homes east of Jerusalem threatens to sever the Palestinian city of Ezariya from the West Bank and torpedo any chance of a contiguous Palestinian state. The project would effectively cut the main artery connecting the northern and southern West Bank, isolating Ezariya and destroying its status as a major commercial hub. This move is part of a broader Israeli strategy to create irreversible facts on the ground, making a two-state solution impossible. Local Palestinian business owners and residents express despair, viewing the plan as the end of their livelihoods and any prospect for a viable future.</p>

          <p>The rollout of new fees for asylum seekers, part of a budget bill signed by President Trump, has caused widespread confusion and fear among immigrants who risk having their cases dismissed for non-payment. Government messaging has been contradictory, and for a period, there was no clear way for applicants with pending cases in immigration court to pay the required $100 annual fee online. This bureaucratic chaos has led to panic, with some asylum seekers receiving deportation orders for failing to pay a fee they had no mechanism to submit. Advocacy groups have sued the administration, arguing the process threatens to deprive applicants of fair consideration of their claims.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that American political discourse is suffering from a 'bipartisan moral collapse,' characterized by increasingly violent, racist, and cruel rhetoric from figures on both the left and right. The article cites recent examples, including Young Republicans joking about gas chambers, a Trump nominee's 'Nazi streak,' and a Democratic candidate wishing for a rival's children to die. The author suggests this trend could be due to the erosion of privacy, the normalization of vulgarity by Donald Trump, or a genuine radicalization of younger generations who are more open to political violence. This normalization of extreme language reflects a deep loss of trust in democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Two Republican U.S. senators are escalating their investigation into the January firestorms in Los Angeles County, but their focus is almost exclusively on the Palisades fire, which affected wealthy coastal areas. In a letter to the L.A. City Council, they demanded extensive documents related to the city's fire department staffing, water supply, and wildfire preparations for that specific blaze. The letter only briefly mentions the deadly Eaton fire, which ravaged the working-class community of Altadena and was plagued by delayed evacuation alerts. This disparity in focus has led to criticism that the probe is a politically motivated 'witch hunt' that ignores issues in less affluent areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historically high cocoa prices are spooking Halloween shoppers and candy manufacturers, leading to a noticeable shift away from chocolate treats. The cost of cocoa has nearly doubled since last year due to poor harvests in West Africa, causing major brands like Hershey and Mars to raise prices and employ 'shrinkflation' tactics. As a result, consumers are finding smaller bags with fewer chocolate pieces and more non-chocolate fillers like nuts. This price pressure is boosting sales of gummy, sour, and fruity candies, which are growing at a much faster rate than their chocolate counterparts as shoppers seek more affordable options for trick-or-treaters.</p>

          <p>An inquest has determined that Ian Watkins, the former frontman of the band Lostprophets, died in prison after being stabbed in the neck. Watkins, 48, was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for numerous child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. The coroner's court heard that paramedics were called to the jail following the assault, and a post-mortem report confirmed an incision to the neck as the cause of death. The inquest has been adjourned as two men have been charged with his murder, while two others were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.</p>

          <p>The FBI has uncovered a sophisticated, mafia-operated illegal poker scheme that allegedly cheated wealthy gamblers and celebrities out of at least $7 million using high-tech devices. Prosecutors described a 'mind-boggling' fraud involving X-ray tables to read cards, rigged shuffling machines, and special contact lenses that could identify pre-marked cards. More than 30 people were arrested, including members of several La Cosa Nostra crime families and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, who was allegedly enlisted to entice victims. The elaborate plot used off-site operators to relay information to players at the table, making it nearly impossible for unsuspecting targets to win.</p>

          <p>Nuclear policy experts have weighed in on the accuracy of the new film 'A House of Dynamite,' which portrays a U.S. leadership team responding to a surprise nuclear missile attack. While praising the authentic depiction of command-and-control systems like the presidential 'football' and the White House Situation Room, many specialists found the film's central scenario unrealistic. They argue a real nuclear conflict is more likely to escalate from a conventional war, and a surprise attack would involve multiple warheads, not a single missile. Furthermore, experts noted that U.S. doctrine would likely favor riding out the initial attack to confirm the aggressor before launching a retaliatory second strike.</p>

The payments, totaling £60,500, were made in late 2019, shortly after the prince's withdrawal from public life. The businessman, Adrian Gleave, was a former director at SVS Securities, which was shut down by financial regulators for investing clients' pension funds in high-risk bonds to generate large commissions.
