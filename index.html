          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals a rise in Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet approval rating to 37%, up from 31.7% in May.  This increase coincides with public support for a policy shift to increase domestic rice production due to record high prices and shortages.  However, a significant portion of respondents still deem the government's response to rising rice prices insufficient. The article also notes public disapproval of the ruling party's proposed cash handouts.</p>
