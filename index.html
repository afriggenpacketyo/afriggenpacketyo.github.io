          <p>Daniil Medvedev was controversially knocked out of the US Open first round by Benjamin Bonzi after a significant on-court incident involving a photographer. During a match point in the third set, the photographer's intrusion caused a heated six-minute delay and sparked Medvedev's furious reaction towards the umpire's decision to re-serve. This highly unusual disturbance energized the New York crowd in Medvedev's favor, but despite the shift in momentum and his own past Grand Slam success, Bonzi ultimately recovered to secure a dramatic five-set victory. The incident resulted in the photographer's credential being revoked, marking another memorable, albeit frustrating, chapter in Medvedev's US Open history.</p>

Maso stresses the importance of new arrivals adapting to German culture while preserving their own, suggesting workshops to facilitate this complex process and build new lives. His perspective is particularly relevant given Germany's rising anti-immigrant sentiment, underscored by the far-right AfD party's recent electoral successes and calls for "remigration." Despite these significant political challenges, Maso remains hopeful about his personal future and expresses a strong willingness to potentially compete for his adopted country.</p>

Wilkinson described feeling "half alive" without his wife, Heather, who died along with two others after consuming a Beef Wellington laced with highly toxic death cap mushrooms prepared by Patterson. He detailed his own near-fatal struggle, which necessitated a liver transplant, and conveyed his profound grief for his wife and two closest friends.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate unexpectedly cooled to 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021 and falling below economists' forecasts. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, primarily driven by decreases in retail, other goods, and electricity and gas prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates continued moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price hikes. This moderation, alongside slower nominal wage growth, strengthens the case for further monetary policy loosening by the MAS, providing a buffer against potential economic weakening and global trade tensions.

Notably, windfarm developer Orsted's shares plummeted by approximately 18% after US authorities ordered a halt to construction of a near-complete project off Rhode Island, threatening the company's capital-raising plans. Conversely, Keurig Dr Pepper's announced acquisition of Dutch coffee company JDE Peet's for €15.7 billion led to a significant jump in JDE Peet's shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures of up to 30C and sunshine this bank holiday Monday, particularly in the Midlands and North-West, with Wales potentially seeing its hottest late August bank holiday on record. This warm spell follows a summer already marked by four heatwaves, putting it on track to be one of the UK's hottest. However, the heat will be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are forecast to bring blustery winds and widespread rain, first to Northern Ireland and then across most of the UK overnight, ushering in a much more changeable and cooler week.</p>

Following this major acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, US-listed companies.

The Guard's role has primarily involved protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control, with no reported threats requiring weapons.

          <p>Following Donald Trump's re-election, many Americans are actively relocating to Europe, citing a strong desire to escape the US's increasingly polarized climate and his administration's wide-ranging policies. Families like the Gormans rapidly moved to Barcelona, expressing relief at avoiding potential impacts of executive orders, such as those defining sex and affecting non-binary passport markers. Relocation firms across Europe report a significant surge in inquiries and applications for European passports and visas from Americans. Celebrities have also publicized their moves, fueling a movement driven by concerns over political retribution, attacks on academia, and the perceived normalization of authoritarian impulses in the US.</p>

          <p>China is on the brink of a significant turbine leap with the development of an innovative airship-like floating wind power generation system, specifically designed for remote locations and disaster zones where conventional power supplies are inadequate. Weng Hanke, Chief Technology Officer of Beijing SAWES Energy Technology Company, announced that the firm’s latest 1MW power generation unit is currently preparing for a crucial test flight. This advanced system, a collaborative effort between SAWES, Tsinghua University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, builds on the success of an earlier 30-meter long prototype. The prototype successfully ascended to 1,000 meters, hovered, and transmitted electricity to the ground, proving the technology's feasibility at a smaller scale.</p>

          <p>Airline booking systems are poised for a major transformation, moving beyond traditional linear reservation models to modern digital retail experiences akin to Amazon or Spotify. Alex Mans, CEO of travel tech company Flyr, highlights the crucial introduction of a "shopping cart" feature, which will allow customers to book multiple flights, different seat classes, and various add-ons within a single, flexible transaction. This next-generation "offer and order management" technology aims to offer a more personalized and flexible booking process, enabling easier changes and refunds, and allowing airlines to sell hotels, car rentals, and other services directly. Riyadh Air is notably set to be the world's first "digitally native" airline, launching later this year without legacy Passenger Service System (PSS) technology, signaling a significant industry shift.</p>

          <p>Many Starbucks workers are expressing significant dissatisfaction with their jobs, citing low pay, arbitrary work rules, and a perceived failure to balance corporate goals with employee needs. While Starbucks promotes itself as a company offering purpose and benefits like healthcare for part-timers, current and former baristas argue that an intense focus on cost-cutting has led to understaffing and a lack of employee voice. Despite a recent pledge from COO Troy Alstead to "transform the U.S. partner experience" after negative media coverage, workers remain skeptical. They are demanding higher wages, stable and predictable schedules, and more input into their working conditions, asserting that the company's focus on profits has increasingly led its leadership to disregard employee concerns.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency due to the state's infant mortality rate rising to its highest level in over a decade, nearly double the national average. Black infants are disproportionately affected, dying at more than twice the rate of white infants, and these racial disparities are unfortunately widening. The state's plan to address this severe crisis includes expanding prenatal services, creating an obstetric system of care to improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs. Experts caution that structural inequities, rather than solely individual behavior or clinical care, are key drivers, with federal funding cuts and Mississippi's non-expansion of Medicaid further complicating efforts to improve outcomes.</p>

His Monday playbook suggests an "outrageously bullish narrative," recommending buying housing, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and initial public offerings (IPOs)-related stocks, which are expected to respond strongly to a "don't fight the Fed" analysis.
