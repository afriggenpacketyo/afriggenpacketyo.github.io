          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, confirming he will have a successor. This decision ends years of speculation and directly challenges China, which has long asserted that it has the sole authority to approve the next religious leader. The 14th Dalai Lama stated that the process of identifying his reincarnation will be handled by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit he established, and must follow traditional Buddhist practices. This announcement is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and is expected to lead to a scenario with two rival Dalai Lamas: one recognized by his followers and another appointed by Beijing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed President Trump's major legislative package, which includes approximately $4 trillion in tax cuts and increased funding for border security. The bill, which now moves to the House of Representatives, also proposes significant cuts to health programs like Medicaid and eliminates various clean energy initiatives. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the legislation is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade and could result in nearly 12 million people losing their health insurance. House Speaker Mike Johnson aims for a final vote this week, despite potential opposition from some Republicans concerned about the fiscal impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator has revealed that the power outage and fire that shut down Heathrow Airport were caused by a problem first identified seven years ago. The issue involved moisture in electrical components at a key substation, but appropriate mitigating actions were never implemented. The failure led to thousands of flight cancellations, affecting around 270,000 journeys and raising serious questions about the UK's energy resilience and infrastructure maintenance. In response, Heathrow criticized National Grid for its failure to maintain its equipment, while the energy regulator has opened an enforcement investigation into potential license breaches.</p>

          <p>Alexi Saenz, the leader of an MS-13 clique on Long Island, is facing sentencing for his role in a federal racketeering case that includes eight murders and other violent crimes. Saenz pleaded guilty to authorizing the killings, which gained national attention during the Trump administration. Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, highlighting his continued violent behavior and gang involvement while incarcerated. However, Saenz's lawyers are requesting a 45-year sentence, arguing he is remorseful and was a victim of a traumatic upbringing and gang grooming. The case underscores the brutal violence of the gang, including the high-profile 2016 killings of two teenage girls.</p>

          <p>The University of Pennsylvania has agreed to modify swimming records set by transgender athlete Lia Thomas as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Education. The agreement resolves a federal civil rights investigation which found the university had violated the rights of female athletes. Penn will restore records to female swimmers who competed against Thomas, issue them personal apologies, and formally adopt biology-based definitions for its athletic programs. While the university stated it was complying with NCAA rules at the time, it acknowledged that some student-athletes were disadvantaged. The settlement marks a significant development in the ongoing national debate over transgender participation in women's sports.</p>

This defeat has intensified pressure on coach Jesse Marsch and the team, robbing them of crucial competitive matches one year before co-hosting the World Cup. The article analyzes the team's struggles, pointing to issues with on-field temperament, questionable team selections, and an inability to perform under pressure. While some individual players showed promise during the tournament, the overall performance has raised serious questions about the team's readiness to compete on the world stage and its ability to handle high-stakes moments.</p>

          <p>MethaneSAT, an $88 million satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gas emissions with high precision, has been lost in space after ceasing communications with its ground controllers. The project was backed by Jeff Bezos's Earth Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), and the New Zealand government. Its mission was to hold countries and corporations accountable for methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. While New Zealand officials called the development disappointing, the EDF framed it as a setback rather than a complete failure, emphasizing the valuable knowledge gained from the endeavor.

Analysts attribute the strong performance to the company's powerful branding, pricing power, and rapid sales growth, particularly in its online channels. The stock's continued rise suggests strong market confidence in its growth prospects, including its expansion into overseas markets, even as it trades at a high valuation compared to competitors like Chow Tai Fook.

          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has signaled a crackdown on the widespread price wars affecting numerous industries by vowing to regulate "disorderly low-price competition." This marks a more direct characterization of the issue, which officials previously referred to with the vaguer term "involutionary competition." The move aims to protect innovation, improve product quality, and promote the phasing out of outdated production capacity. Beijing views this aggressive price-cutting, where companies suppress prices to gain market share, as a significant threat to the long-term health and upgrading of the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Trump over the editing of a '60 Minutes' interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The lawsuit alleged election interference, a claim many legal experts considered frivolous. The settlement, which includes Trump's legal fees but no apology, was reportedly pushed by Paramount's corporate leadership against the wishes of CBS News executives, who later resigned. This deal occurs as Paramount's sale to Skydance Media is under review by the FCC, now led by a Trump appointee, leading critics to suggest the payment is "protection money" to ensure the deal's approval.</p>

Headley, who had a previous conviction for sexual assault in the 1970s, will now be considered a suspect in several other unsolved homicide and sexual assault cases in Suffolk, where he lived.

          <p>The Indiana Fever defeated the Minnesota Lynx 74-59 to win the WNBA Commissionerâ€™s Cup championship, despite the absence of their star rookie, Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with a groin injury. Natasha Howard stepped up with a dominant performance, earning MVP honors with 16 points and 12 rebounds while leading a stout defensive effort that held the top-ranked Lynx to their worst offensive output of the season. The Fever overcame an early 13-point deficit with balanced scoring and resilience, showcasing their depth and ability to win without their main star. The victory marks a significant achievement for the team and a gut-check moment in their season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal. In a social media post, Trump stated that during the truce, the U.S. would collaborate with all parties to end the war, with Qatar and Egypt set to deliver the final deal. Israel has not publicly confirmed this agreement, and there has been no immediate comment from Hamas. The announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This development follows increased international pressure and stalled negotiations aimed at securing a hostage release and ending the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>Recognizing copper's critical role in the green energy transition, China is intensifying efforts to secure its supply chain by investing heavily in African mining and processing facilities. While the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia have been primary targets, Chinese investment is now expanding to Botswana. This strategic positioning comes as China faces increasing competition and restrictions from Western nations, which are also vying for critical minerals essential for electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. Chinese companies are making significant investments to acquire and develop African copper mines, underscoring the mineral's growing importance in the global shift away from fossil fuels.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced a significant political setback after being forced to abandon key elements of his welfare reform bill to prevent a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The climbdown, which occurred after days of mounting internal opposition, has been described as a humiliation that leaves the new government appearing weak and not in control of its parliamentary agenda. The U-turn leaves a multi-billion pound hole in the public finances, with many now believing that tax rises in the autumn budget are inevitable. This episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority and raised questions about his leadership and the stability of his government.</p>

In a statement, frontman Dave Grohl reflected on the band's journey through joy and heartbreak, paying tribute to both Hawkins and other former members. The release also comes less than a year after Grohl publicly addressed personal family matters. The new track features the band's signature dynamic shift from subdued verses to explosive, guitar-driven choruses, with Grohl's powerful vocals at the forefront.</p>

Tarvet, who plays college tennis in the U.S. at the University of San Diego, is approaching the daunting match with quiet confidence, viewing it as an opportunity rather than just an experience. His journey represents the growing trend of British players developing their skills through the competitive American college tennis system before turning professional, and his match against Alcaraz is now a highly anticipated David-versus-Goliath encounter.</p>

          <p>At least 180 current and former UK armed forces aircrew are taking legal action against the Ministry of Defence (MoD), claiming their cancer diagnoses were caused by exposure to toxic fumes in military helicopters. The claims relate to service on four aircraft types, including the Sea King, Puma, and Chinook. While the MoD has reached out-of-court settlements in at least six cases without admitting liability, it maintains that engine exhaust poses no health risk. A veterans' group is urging the MoD to implement a cancer screening program and raise awareness, as many former service members may be unaware of the potential health risks associated with their service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, economists Joseph Stiglitz and JosÃ© Antonio Ocampo argue that a recent G7 deal exempting U.S. companies from a global minimum tax agreement undermines international tax fairness. They contend the decision, made under pressure from the U.S., puts the interests of powerful multinationals over those of developing countries and ordinary citizens. This exemption allows some U.S. firms to continue using tax havens, creating an uneven playing field and incentivizing a global "race to the bottom" on corporate taxes. The authors call for the international community to reject the G7 deal and instead strengthen global tax cooperation through the United Nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent article analyzes the direct link between human-caused climate change and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like the current heatwave in Europe. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to record-breaking global temperatures and deadlier heatwaves. These conditions disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and disrupt societal functions, from education to infrastructure, as roads melt and railways buckle. Experts stress that long-term solutions require a rapid transition to renewable energy and climate-proofing cities with green spaces, alongside immediate measures like staying hydrated and avoiding sun exposure during peak heat.</p>

While market leader BYD continues to dominate, other U.S.-listed rivals like Nio and Li Auto showed more modest momentum.

The ruling provides immediate relief for hundreds of thousands of Haitians who rely on the status for legal residency and work authorization, citing the ongoing instability and danger in their home country.
