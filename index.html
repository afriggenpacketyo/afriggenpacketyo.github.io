            <p>President Xi Jinping is scheduled to visit Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, marking his first foreign trip of the year, as China seeks to strengthen ties with Southeast Asian nations amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. This tour emphasizes China's desire to present itself as a reliable partner in the region, particularly as concerns grow over Washington's commitment to Southeast Asia. The visit also aims to boost mutual trust and cooperation in industrial and supply chains between China and its neighbors. This comes as economic ministers from ASEAN nations have expressed a desire to engage in dialogue with the US rather than impose retaliatory measures.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, emphasizing that his case should be handled as if the deportation had not occurred. While the court acknowledged the administration's argument regarding the President's authority in foreign affairs, it also directed a lower court to clarify its order to ensure it doesn't overstep executive branch prerogatives. This decision underscores the importance of due process, even as the administration alleges Garcia is a gang member, a claim he denies. The case will now return to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>

            <p>North Carolina lawmakers passed a bill prohibiting emergency aid providers from discriminating based on political affiliation or speech, prompted by allegations that FEMA workers avoided homeowners with Trump signs after Hurricane Helene. The bill also restricts the requirement of personal demographic information for state emergency assistance applicants unless necessary for grant allocation or legally mandated. This legislation aims to ensure equitable access to aid, addressing concerns raised after a former FEMA supervisor claimed she was instructed to avoid politically charged encounters, sparking debate over the agency's response to the disaster. The bill will now move on to the Senate for further consideration.</p>

            <p>In the case of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, the government asserts Secretary of State Marco Rubio's authority to deem his presence in the U.S. as compromising foreign policy interests, citing Khalil's alleged role in 'antisemitic protests.'

They plan to request to depose Rubio in court to understand the grounds for his determination.

            <p>Gary Lewis, a record shop owner in Northallerton, survived a cardiac arrest after being injected with a muscle-relaxing anaesthetic by a nurse, Darren Harris, who was convicted of attempted murder but offered no explanation. Lewis expresses his ongoing struggle to understand the motive behind the attack, which has left him with paranoia. Despite returning to work shortly after the incident, Lewis grapples with the psychological impact of the crime, especially the fact that he might never know why he was targeted. Harris's employment was terminated, and the hospital reviewed its medication storage procedures.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced further turmoil after a brief rally, with investors reacting negatively to President Trump's tariff policies and ongoing trade tensions with China. Despite positive economic news, such as the EU suspending retaliatory tariffs and cooling inflation, the market remained unstable. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen criticized Trump's economic policies as a 'self-inflicted wound' on the economy. The market volatility reflects investor uncertainty surrounding the trade war and its potential impact on economic growth.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, acknowledging that his removal was 'illegal'. While the court affirmed the administration's authority over foreign affairs, it directed the government to ensure Garcia's case is handled as if the deportation never occurred. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson emphasized the due process rights of migrants in U.S. custody. Garcia's attorney hailed the decision as a victory for the rule of law.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Supreme Court's decision requiring the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador sets the stage for a potential confrontation, testing Trump's willingness to abide by court orders. The ruling, while seemingly unanimous, carries significant political risk given Trump's past disregard for judicial decisions. The administration's compliance or defiance will have far-reaching implications for the balance of power and the future of constitutional government. A failure to comply could further erode the rights of citizens and immigrants alike.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's effort to reduce inflation to 2%. While the monthly CPI fell 0.1%, the first drop in nearly five years, the report also showed that egg prices continued to rise. Experts note that inflationary risks persist due to Trump's tariffs, which are expected to impact prices later in the year. The Federal Reserve is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy decisions, with economists anticipating potential rate cuts later in the year.</p>
