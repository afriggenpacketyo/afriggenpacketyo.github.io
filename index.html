          <p>World leaders have begun reacting to President Trump's announcement that the U.S. military conducted airstrikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, prompting a range of responses. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu praised Trump's decision as a "bold" move that will change history, emphasizing a "peace through strength" approach. In contrast, United Nations Secretary-General Guterres warned that the strikes represent a dangerous escalation that threatens global peace and security, advocating for diplomacy instead. Venezuela's Minister of Foreign Affairs Yvan Gil condemned the attacks, demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, marking a major escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump stated that all planes are now outside Iranian airspace and warned of further action if Iran does not pursue peace. The strikes involved a "full payload of BOMBS" on the primary site, Fordo, and were described as a "spectacular military success." This decision follows a period of heightened tensions and diplomatic efforts to address Iran's nuclear program, with the U.S. alerting Israel ahead of the strikes. The strikes are intended to end the nuclear threat posed by Iran. </p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, characterizing the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites as a "spectacular military success" and warning of more attacks if Iran does not "make peace." He stated that the targeted sites "have been completely and totally obliterated," aiming to eliminate the nuclear threat from the "world's No. 1 state sponsor of terror." Trump thanked U.S. service members and the Israeli military for their cooperation, while Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes but asserted they would not halt Iran's nuclear program. Prior to the strikes, Iran had threatened retaliation if the U.S. intervened in the conflict with Israel. </p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers across the political spectrum have voiced varied opinions. Congressional Republicans, including Senators Graham and Cruz, largely supported the action, with Graham calling it "the right call." Conversely, Democratic Leader Jeffries demanded an immediate briefing for Congress, criticizing Trump for not seeking congressional authorization and risking entanglement in a "disastrous war." Some Democrats, like Representative Ocasio-Cortez, deemed the strikes a "grave violation of the Constitution" and grounds for impeachment, while others, such as Senator Fetterman, expressed full support for the U.S. action. The strikes have reignited debates about the president's authority to engage in military action without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump's promise to be a peacemaker is now under scrutiny as the U.S. has launched a direct military strike on Iran, targeting three nuclear sites. This action breaks from Trump's prior pledges to keep the United States out of war and prevent "World War Three." The decision to strike Iran marks a sharp turn from Trump's suggestion just 48 hours prior that the U.S. would wait "two weeks" to see if the conflict between Israel and Iran could be resolved diplomatically. Despite Trump's long-standing concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions, the U.S. strike puts Washington in direct conflict with Tehran, raising questions about the future of diplomacy and the potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>A social media account called the Pentagon Pizza Report, which previously claimed to have accurately predicted Israel's initial strikes on Iran, posted about "HIGH" pizza traffic near the Pentagon shortly before the U.S. launched attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. The account also noted abnormally low activity levels at Freddie's Beach Bar, a restaurant near the Pentagon, suggesting potential overtime at the Pentagon. The account echoed President Trump's wording in its post following the announcement of the strikes. Additionally, the account noted a "HUGE traffic surge" at the Domino's closest to MacDill Air Force Base, home of CENTCOM, shortly before Trump's address to the nation. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, has had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original findings. Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout her incarceration and worked with the Loyola Project for the Innocent to re-examine the evidence. The appellate team says that several blood-like stains on items including a pillow sham, the nightstand, a lampshade, turned out not to be blood, casting doubt on the prosecution's case. The case raises questions about the reliability of the evidence presented at trial and the thoroughness of the initial investigation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said Saturday that the US military attacked three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel's effort to decapitate the country's nuclear program in a risky tactic to weaken an old enemy amid the threat of retaliation from Tehran that could unleash a broader regional conflict. The Iranian government did not immediately acknowledge any attacks taking place. Trump stated that B-2 stealth bombers were used, but did not specify what type of bombs were dropped. The attacks are a dangerous decision, as Iran has vowed to retaliate if the United States joins the Israeli attack. </p>

          <h2>US Strike on Iran Carries Significant Risks for Trump</h2>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities carries considerable risks, despite his claim of a "very successful" attack. Iran had previously warned of retaliation if the U.S. joined Israel in attacking its territory, raising concerns about potential escalations. Trump appears to be hoping that the strikes will force Iran to make greater concessions at the negotiating table, though this seems unlikely given Iran's previous unwillingness to negotiate under attack. The move has also drawn criticism from within Trump's own "America First" movement, and if the attack pulls the U.S. into a larger conflict, it could lead to an uprising within his ranks.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong faces the risk of splitting into two distinct economies, with the financial, professional, and business services sectors thriving due to China's resurgent economy and the shifting global power balance. The city's stock market is benefiting from its position as a platform for Chinese tech companies to raise funds and connect with global markets. Government policies aimed at maximizing the use of Hong Kong's financial markets have also contributed to the sector's growth. However, other sectors, such as food and retail, are not experiencing the same level of success. (not investment advice)</p>
