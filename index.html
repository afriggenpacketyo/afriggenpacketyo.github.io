        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article outlines four strategies for borrowers to reduce their credit card debt in June 2025, given the current economic climate of high interest rates and lingering inflation. The strategies include balance transfer credit cards, which allow borrowers to transfer balances to cards with low or 0% introductory interest rates, and debt consolidation loans, which offer lower interest rates compared to credit cards. The article also suggests debt management programs for those needing expert assistance and credit card debt forgiveness for those with significant debt and financial hardships. Borrowers are encouraged to review these options and evaluate their unique situations to determine the most suitable approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two foreign nationals, Cui Guanghai of China and John Miller of the United Kingdom, have been charged by the U.S. Justice Department for conspiring to smuggle U.S. military equipment and technology, including missiles, into China. Cui and Miller allegedly worked with individuals, who were actually FBI agents, to procure military equipment and discussed ways to hide the equipment to avoid detection. They are also accused of recruiting people to silence a U.S. citizen from speaking out against Chinese President Xi Jinping. The charges come amid increased scrutiny of visa applicants from China by the Trump administration, reflecting ongoing concerns about national security and foreign repression.</p>
