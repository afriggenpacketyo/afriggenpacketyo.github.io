          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the influential frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath and a successful solo artist, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death, though no specific cause was provided. Osbourne, who had publicly battled Parkinson's disease and other health issues, was a towering figure in rock music, known for his dark imagery, chaotic stage presence, and later, a surprising turn as a beloved reality TV father. He was twice inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, cementing his legacy as a foundational artist in the metal genre.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump recently held a meeting with Amazon founder and Blue Origin CEO Jeff Bezos at the White House. The discussion, which reportedly lasted over an hour, comes after a historically contentious relationship between the two figures, particularly during Trump's first term. In his second term, relations have appeared to thaw, with Bezos reportedly seeking to leverage a falling-out between Trump and rival billionaire Elon Musk. The conversation is believed to have touched upon government contracts, a key area of competition for their respective space exploration companies, Blue Origin and SpaceX.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old child was attacked by a mountain lion while walking with family in Washington's Olympic National Park and was subsequently airlifted to a Seattle hospital. The incident occurred near the Hurricane Ridge area, a popular destination within the park. Following the attack, park rangers and a canine team located the animal, which was collared, and euthanized it the next morning. The National Park Service has stated there is no further threat to the public and is conducting an investigation into the circumstances of the rare and frightening encounter.</p>

          <p>Marine veteran Alejandro Barranco addressed a House committee, describing the traumatic and forcible detention of his undocumented father, Narciso Barranco, by federal immigration agents. He stated that his father, who has no criminal record and two other sons serving as Marines, was violently arrested while at his landscaping job. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the father resisted and swung a tool at agents. Barranco argued the immigration system is broken and that indiscriminate raids are tearing apart families who contribute to their communities, calling for more humane policies.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales</h2>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering a proposal to eliminate the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales. Currently, individuals can exclude up to $250,000 of these gains from their taxable income, a figure that rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Proponents argue that eliminating the tax would unlock housing inventory by encouraging older homeowners to sell without facing a large tax penalty. However, critics suggest the change would primarily benefit wealthy Americans and could further inflate home prices, exacerbating affordability issues for many families. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors presented evidence that Gibson, along with his mother and cousin who also received lengthy sentences, used force and coercion in what was described as a trafficking operation, not just pimping.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded its investigation into the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., the husband of former U.S. Representative Mary Peltola. The final report identified several contributing factors, including the pilot's decision to fly the plane above its maximum takeoff weight with a load of moose meat. Additionally, a set of moose antlers affixed to the plane's exterior created significant drag and a weight imbalance. These factors, combined with downdrafts and turbulent conditions, likely resulted in the aircraft having insufficient power to clear the terrain.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced that its second-quarter earnings were significantly impacted by President Trump's auto tariffs, costing the company an estimated $1.1 billion. While the automaker's overall results beat Wall Street estimates, the tariff costs raised concerns and caused its stock to fall. The company affirmed its full-year guidance, which already accounts for a potential $4 to $5 billion total impact from tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives to reduce its exposure to the new trade policies.

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's experienced a wild day of trading, surging dramatically before paring some gains, in a pattern reminiscent of past meme stock rallies. The stock's trading volume was nearly 17 times its daily average, driven by chatter on social media forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The company is a prime candidate for such a rally due to its brand recognition and a very high level of short interest, where investors bet on the stock's price falling. The movement was not tied to any fundamental news, as the underlying business continues to face significant challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potentially catastrophic incident was averted at Mexico City's international airport when a Delta Air Lines flight was forced to abruptly halt its takeoff.

The Delta crew slammed on the brakes, stopping the plane safely before returning to the gate. The incident, which is now under investigation by aviation authorities in both Mexico and the U.S., highlights ongoing concerns about airport operational safety.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified and released over 100 pages of files related to the U.S. intelligence assessment of Russia's 2016 election interference. In an accompanying memo, Gabbard alleged the documents show evidence of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials to undermine then-candidate Trump. Democrats have vehemently rejected this claim, accusing Gabbard of dangerously misrepresenting the intelligence and attempting to rewrite history. The move has reignited the partisan battles over the 2016 election and put the intelligence community's actions back in the political spotlight.</p>
