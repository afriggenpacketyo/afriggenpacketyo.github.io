          <p>Naoya "Monster" Inoue retained his undisputed super bantamweight world championship by defeating Ramon Cardenas with an eighth-round technical knockout. Cardenas surprised Inoue with a knockdown in the second round, but Inoue recovered and dominated the later rounds, eventually stopping Cardenas in the eighth. Inoue expressed surprise at the knockdown but maintained composure, adapting his strategy from the third round onward. He also confirmed his next fight would be against Murodjon Akhmadaliev in Japan in September, as he looks to conquer a fifth weight class.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco, intending to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Democrats have criticized the proposal, deeming it unserious, while experts question the necessity and cost-effectiveness of reopening the facility. Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, currently operates as a tourist site. Trump argues that reopening the prison would symbolize law, order, and justice.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing national security concerns and a concerted effort by other nations.

The move follows previous efforts to promote Hollywood and address job losses in the U.S. film industry.</p>

          <p>India has commenced work to increase reservoir capacity at two hydroelectric projects in Kashmir after suspending its water-sharing treaty with Pakistan. This action follows a recent attack in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan-based militants, leading to heightened tensions between the two nations. The work involves a "reservoir flushing" process to remove sediment, which India did not inform Pakistan about due to treaty restrictions. While this may not immediately impact water supply to Pakistan, it could eventually affect the country if other projects follow suit.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the popular association of roses with the color red. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of the flower was likely a single-petal yellow flower with seven leaflets. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers', are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, coming in a wide array of shapes, sizes, and colours.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly catching up to, and in some cases surpassing, the United States in critical technologies like artificial intelligence, according to a recent New York Times article. The authors, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu, point to the rapid development and deployment of AI models, electric vehicles, and robotics in China. They argue that China's open-source approach to AI and its efficient manufacturing capabilities are giving it a competitive edge. The article suggests that the U.S. needs to share more of its AI technologies, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its lead.</p>

          <p>Human rights groups have condemned the arrest of the father and brother of Anna Kwok, an exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, marking the first instance of the city's national security law being used to target family members of an overseas activist. Kwok's relatives were arrested on suspicion of assisting her in handling funds from a life insurance policy. The arrests have been criticized as a blatant attempt to silence overseas dissidents by targeting their families at home, disregarding fundamental human rights and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Chinese garment factories, particularly in Guangzhou, are facing significant challenges due to tariffs and trade tensions with the United States, according to a New York Times article. President Trump's new tax on cheap imports and rising costs have cut into businesses' profit margins, making it impossible for some to continue selling on platforms like Amazon. Factory owners are considering relocating their operations to provinces with lower wages or to countries like Vietnam to avoid tariffs. The situation is compounded by declining domestic consumer spending, leaving many businesses struggling to survive.</p>

          <p>As Germany faces significant economic and social challenges, including rising inequality and the threat of nationalist populism, it is about to inaugurate Friedrich Merz as its new chancellor. The article suggests that Merz, known for his divisive rhetoric and policy failures, is not the unifier that Germany needs. The author argues that Merz's actions, such as flirting with the far-right and making controversial statements about migrants, risk empowering more radical political shifts. The article concludes that Merz needs to change course quickly to address Germany's challenges and prevent further division.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the lack of trash bins in public areas is the biggest inconvenience for visitors to Japan. The Japan Tourism Agency found that 21.9% of foreign visitors surveyed cited this issue as their top concern. While the figure improved from the previous year, many respondents reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins in Japan is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks, leading to increased littering in tourist spots.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence, after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of the Constitution as the foundation of American unity. He highlighted his commitment to upholding the Constitution during the 2020 election certification process, implicitly contrasting his actions with those of President Trump. Pence's remarks came shortly after an interview in which Trump expressed uncertainty about whether non-citizens deserve due process under the Fifth Amendment.
