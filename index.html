          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of rapid deterioration as only 73,000 jobs were added in July, falling well short of estimates. Compounding the weak report, job gains for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating hiring was much weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate also increased to 4.2%. This slowdown is intensifying pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy amid growing concerns about a potential downturn.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn following a combination of unsettling economic news. The market decline was triggered by President Trump's executive order imposing sweeping new tariffs on nearly 70 countries, creating widespread uncertainty in global trade. Investor anxiety was further exacerbated by a surprisingly weak jobs report, which revealed a sharp slowdown in hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. This dual impact has raised serious concerns among investors about the near-term health and stability of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter profits that, while lower than the previous year, successfully beat Wall Street's expectations. The energy giant's net income was bolstered by strong production growth, particularly from its operations in the Permian Basin and Guyana. This increased output helped to offset the financial impact of a roughly 10% decline in global oil prices. The company also continued its cost-cutting measures and returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, signaling operational strength.</p>

          <p>Chevron announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst predictions, even as profits declined from the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's performance was aided by record global production, including significant output from the Permian Basin. Officials also highlighted the recent $53 billion acquisition of Hess, which is expected to begin boosting earnings by the fourth quarter. The successful completion of the Hess deal, following a contentious arbitration battle with Exxon Mobil, positions Chevron for future growth in key production areas.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made an urgent call for stronger international sanctions against Russia after a massive assault on Kyiv killed at least 31 people, including five children. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched over 300 drones and multiple cruise missiles in one of the deadliest attacks on the capital since the full-scale invasion began. Zelensky emphasized that existing sanctions are effective but must be intensified to halt Russian aggression. The attack has drawn widespread condemnation, with U.S. President Trump calling Russia's actions disgusting.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, popular Twitch streamer and progressive commentator Hasan Piker addressed his role in online political discourse. Piker discussed the perception of him as a "gateway" to leftist ideas for young men, pushing back against the idea that masculinity or activities like gaming are inherently conservative-coded. He argued that the Democratic party's challenge is not a lack of a left-wing media figure, but a need for stronger policies that directly address voters' concerns. Piker also warned about the increasing ideological investment in far-right ideas among young conservatives.</p>

          <p>Amazon's second-quarter financial report presented a mixed picture that left investors disappointed, causing its stock to fall by 7%. While the company exceeded expectations on revenue and profit for the quarter, its guidance for future profits was weaker than anticipated. Furthermore, the 18% revenue growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division underwhelmed the market, especially when compared to the stronger cloud growth reported by rivals Microsoft and Google. Concerns about increased AI-related spending and competitive pressures in the cloud market are weighing on the company's outlook.</p>

          <p>In a rare public dissent, Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman explained their decision to vote against holding interest rates steady. Both officials argued that the central bank should have implemented a quarter-point rate cut, stating that the inflationary impact of new tariffs is likely temporary. They expressed concern that waiting to ease monetary policy poses a significant risk to the labor market and could lead to a broader economic slowdown. Their statements highlight a growing debate within the Fed about how to properly balance risks to the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of U.S. Department of Education employees are marking their final day after a mass layoff that has cut the agency's staff by roughly half. In interviews, departing civil servants from offices handling grants, civil rights, and student loans expressed deep concern over the agency's ability to perform its core functions. They described their work as vital for protecting students, ensuring taxpayer dollars are used properly, and helping borrowers. The former employees worry that the staff reduction will create a self-fulfilling prophecy of government failure and leave vulnerable students without support.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired a decade-long forensic auditor, Carolyn Feinstein, whose husband operates a controversial app called ICEBlock that tracks the location of federal immigration agents. The DOJ stated the termination was based on a "lack of candor during an internal inquiry" and that it would not tolerate threats against law enforcement. Feinstein's lawyer argues the firing is part of a politically motivated purge of career civil servants. The case highlights the tense intersection of technology, immigration enforcement, and government employment under the current administration.</p>

          <p>South Korea's jailed ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol employed a new form of resistance against questioning by investigators, taking off his prison uniform and lying on the floor of his cell. Yoon, who was removed from office and imprisoned for imposing martial law, is facing a separate investigation into allegations of influence peddling involving his wife. Investigators, who had a warrant to compel his appearance, refrained from using physical force due to safety concerns. The incident adds another dramatic chapter to the political turmoil surrounding the former leader's downfall and trial.</p>
