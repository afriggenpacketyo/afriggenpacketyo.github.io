Rebellions, formed from a merger with Sapeon, is positioned as a domestic rival to Nvidia and is collaborating with Samsung to manufacture its next-generation "Rebel" chip. This partnership is seen as a strategic move for Samsung's foundry business, aiming to secure a major customer and boost its market share against competitor TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes, is reportedly acting as a model inmate, offering legal advice to others while pursuing her own appeal. She recently met with the Deputy Attorney General, fueling speculation about a potential deal or pardon, although legal experts note her history of dishonesty poses a challenge. Her legal team has now petitioned the Supreme Court to hear her appeal, arguing a prior non-prosecution agreement with Epstein should have protected her from charges.</p>

          <p>An article details the remarkable journey of Indian cricketer Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul against England. Hailing from a small, economically challenged village in Bihar, Deep overcame significant personal tragedy, including the deaths of his father and brother, which forced him to pause his cricket aspirations for nearly three years. After relocating to Bengal, his raw talent was recognized, and with coaching to build his self-belief, he rose through the domestic ranks to the IPL and eventually earned his spot on the national Test team, showcasing incredible resilience.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build a network of "AI gigafactories" in an effort to catch up with the U.S. and China in the artificial intelligence sector. These facilities are envisioned as one-stop shops that combine computing power, data, and talent to industrialize the creation of AI models. The EU has committed an initial 20 billion euros to start the project, which aims to attract significant private investment. However, challenges include high costs, the need for modernization of Europe's power grid, and legislative hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

While the pace of yearly rent increases is slowing, the market remains challenging for tenants.

          <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) reported a 59% drop in net profit for its first quarter, causing its shares to fall by over 8%. The airline attributed the decline to lower interest income and losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex restructuring. While operating profit also fell, the company noted that demand for air travel remains strong. However, analysts point to increased competition and the financial drag from Air India as significant near-term challenges for the carrier's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of bribery and witness tampering. The case stemmed from allegations that Uribe, a polarizing figure credited with fighting leftist insurgents but also linked to human rights abuses, attempted to influence imprisoned former paramilitaries to change their testimony against him. The verdict followed a nearly six-month trial that has deeply divided the nation. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal the conviction.</p>

This policy reverses the long-standing practice of allowing individuals who are not a flight or safety risk to be released on bond. Immigrant advocacy groups argue the policy is an unlawful reinterpretation of the law that violates due process rights and is causing "catastrophic" harm to families.

The decision to place a new order, rather than relying on existing inventory, signals Nvidia's confidence in the Chinese market, despite ongoing trade tensions and U.S. national security concerns over advanced AI technology.
