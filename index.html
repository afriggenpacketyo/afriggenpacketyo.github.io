          <h2>Student Loan Collections Resume Amid Rising Borrower Delinquency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 11:23:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Education has restarted collecting on defaulted student loans after a nearly five-year pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a move that could impact millions of borrowers. A recent analysis reveals that delinquency rates among student loan borrowers are at an all-time high, with roughly 20% at risk of defaulting. Borrowers in default may face wage garnishment, withholding of Social Security benefits and tax refunds, and significant credit score damage, potentially losing up to 175 points for those with high credit scores. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that taxpayers should not be responsible for irresponsible loan policies, but the resumption of collections presents challenges for individuals struggling financially.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global investors at the Milken Institute Global Conference, outlining President Donald Trump's "America First Vision" for the U.S. economy. Bessent emphasized tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation as core components of Trump's economic agenda, aiming to stimulate private investment and reduce government waste. He highlighted the administration's goal to make the U.S. more appealing for investors, focusing on policies that benefit ultra-wealthy individuals and entrepreneurs. The speech at the Milken conference served as an explicit appeal to this select group, contrasting with the emphasis on Main Street in Bessent's Wall Street Journal op-ed.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett's unexpected announcement to step down as CEO, marking the end of his 60-year leadership. Buffett, 94, has chosen Greg Abel as his successor, with the board voting unanimously for Abel to assume the role on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. The transition marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which has grown into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate under Buffett's guidance, encompassing insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing, and energy. Despite the transparent transition, shareholders express confidence that Buffett will continue to mentor Abel and provide intellectual capacity for future capital allocation decisions.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has approved plans to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory indefinitely, prompting international concern, particularly from the European Union. This decision follows a Houthi missile strike on Tel Aviv's airport and would involve calling up tens of thousands of reservists for an expanded assault. The plan aims to defeat Hamas and free hostages but would likely exacerbate the humanitarian crisis by pushing more Palestinians into southern Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that Gaza's population will be moved for its own protection, while U.S. officials reiterated their commitment to ending Hamas rule. The UN has rejected Israel's plan to use private security companies to control aid distribution, citing violations of core principles.</p>

A Northwestern University graduate, Pancoe had completed the Explorer's Grand Slam and survived a near-fatal fall in 2018. He was climbing Makalu to raise funds for the pediatric blood cancer program at Lurie Children's Hospital, an institution that played a key role in his own survival of a brain tumor.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is restarting collections on defaulted federal student loans, potentially causing serious damage to borrowers' credit scores. A recent analysis by TransUnion found that consumers facing default have seen their credit scores drop by an average of 63 points, with super prime borrowers experiencing declines of up to 175 points. This impact is particularly severe for those with better credit scores, as any derogatory mark can have a significant and jarring effect. Experts warn that the dramatic and immediate impact of default can shock consumers, making it harder to obtain credit and leading to sharply higher interest rates on mortgages and car loans.</p>

          <p>Two independent medical practices in Minnesota are suing UnitedHealth Group, accusing the corporation of negligence related to a cyberattack on its Change Healthcare payment system. The cyberattack, which paralyzed much of the nation’s health-care payment system for months, led Change to lend billions of dollars to affected medical practices, but the company has now begun demanding repayments. The practices, Odom Health & Wellness and the Dillman Clinic & Lab, claim they sustained excessive expenses due to the attack's fallout, and UnitedHealthcare has been denying claims for patient care for being submitted late. Lawmakers have criticized United’s consolidation of health care companies, and the American Medical Association has expressed concern about practices being pressured to repay loans despite ongoing financial difficulties.</p>

The payment freeze, initially implemented during the coronavirus pandemic, allowed borrowers to improve their credit scores and save money, but its end has led to late payments appearing on credit reports. While President Biden attempted to offer loan forgiveness, the Supreme Court blocked his plan, leaving many borrowers in limbo. The Trump administration intends to end Biden’s SAVE plan, which ties monthly payments to income, and there are concerns about data loss if the Education Department is closed.

          <p>President Trump is set to announce that Washington, D.C., will host the 2027 NFL draft, marking the first time the event will be held on the National Mall. The three-day event will feature NFL teams selecting incoming rookies. The announcement comes as the Commanders and city officials plan to return the team to D.C. with a new domed facility by 2030. Trump's relationship with the NFL has been complex, including past ownership of the New Jersey Generals and disputes over player protests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is engaging in diplomatic efforts to secure deportation agreements with far-flung countries, including Angola and Equatorial Guinea, to facilitate its mass deportation agenda. These talks aim to send migrants, including those who are not citizens of those countries, to nations across the Atlantic Ocean. The administration has already brokered agreements with Latin American countries and is considering using these agreements to deport suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Concerns remain about how deportees will be treated by governments that are not their own.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved plans for an escalation of the military campaign in Gaza, authorizing the call-up of thousands of reservists.

This decision has sparked concerns about the humanitarian impact and the potential for further casualties. The article questions whether additional fighters will fundamentally alter the dynamics of the conflict, given the challenges Israel has faced in achieving its goals in Gaza over the past 18 months.</p>

While Buffett's departure raises questions about the future of Berkshire Hathaway, he has urged his followers to stay humble, and will remain chairman.

Leslie noted Clark's ability to make an immediate impact after her college season and acknowledged the heightened expectations and pressure on the Fever with their new roster and coach. While Clark did not make the U.S. women’s national basketball team for the 2024 Paris Olympics, it appeared to be a blessing in disguise as she appeared to be more in sync with her Fever teammates after the Olympics break than she was at the beginning of the regular season. Leslie also highlighted the increased fan interest and sold-out games due to the "Caitlin Clark effect."</p>

Experts say the U.S. has lost leverage over China due to the tariff war, which has diminished the impact of financial sanctions. This has made it more difficult for the U.S. to enforce sanctions and halt Iran's oil trade.</p>
