          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports a nationwide increase in COVID-19, with wastewater monitoring showing a "moderate" level of viral activity, up from "low" in the previous week. The Western U.S. is experiencing the highest levels, particularly in states like California, Colorado, and Utah. While hospitalizations and deaths are lower than in previous years, officials note that emergency room visits for the virus are also rising. Experts advise that while this summer spike is typical, vulnerable populations should remain cautious as the virus can still cause severe illness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Defense to prepare military options for potential use against drug cartels that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations. U.S. officials confirmed the directive but stated that any military action is not imminent, and the specific scope of the authorization remains unclear. The move follows the administration's February designation of groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and MS-13 as terrorist organizations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated this allows the use of various elements of American power, including intelligence and military assets, to target these groups.</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old American man from Dallas, Texas, was killed by a Cape buffalo while on a trophy hunting safari in South Africa's Limpopo province. The safari company that organized the trip stated the man was fatally injured in a sudden attack by the animal he was tracking. Police found the man deceased with injuries to his torso, with a shot and killed buffalo nearby. The Cape buffalo is considered one of the most dangerous animals to hunt in Africa and is known for its aggressive and vengeful behavior. Trophy hunting is a significant industry in South Africa, generating millions in annual revenue.</p>

          <p>A wildfire northwest of Los Angeles, named the Canyon Fire, has grown rapidly, prompting mandatory evacuation orders for over 2,700 residents and warnings for another 14,000. The blaze expanded from 30 to nearly 5,000 acres in less than a day, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, with temperatures expected to reach 100°F. As of Friday morning, the fire was 25% contained, and no injuries or structural damages had been reported. This is one of several active wildfires in California, where experts note climate change has contributed to longer and more destructive fire seasons.</p>

The USDA has lifted its suspension, stating the facility is now in compliance. However, recent inspection reports from other Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana, and Virginia, obtained by the Associated Press, reveal similar sanitation problems, including meat residue on equipment and blocked drains. Food safety advocates and lawmakers have expressed alarm over this pattern, questioning the company's commitment to reform and the effectiveness of federal oversight.</p>

The jet, valued at $400 million, is intended for presidential use and later for Mr. Trump's presidential library. Critics argue the acquisition is wasteful, redundant, and raises serious concerns about fiscal priorities and national security interests.</p>

          <p>Texas Democrats once again broke quorum in the state legislature, preventing a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan that could significantly increase GOP seats in the U.S. Congress. Despite threats of arrest and suspension of pay, a majority of Democrats remained absent from the special session. Governor Greg Abbott has sought to compel their return, while Democrats have fled to other states to wait out the session's end. In response, California Democrats, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are reportedly considering retaliatory measures to adjust their state's congressional map if the Texas plan proceeds.</p>

The American Meteor Society predicts that the moonlight will wash out most of the fainter meteors, cutting the number of visible meteors from a potential 50 per hour to just 10-20. The Perseids are caused by debris from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle burning up in Earth's atmosphere, and they will remain active, though less intensely, until late August.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, financial experts suggest using a CD laddering strategy to maximize savings while maintaining flexibility. This approach involves opening multiple certificates of deposit (CDs) with staggered maturity dates, allowing savers to lock in currently high rates before they fall further. By spreading funds across short-term and long-term CDs, individuals can benefit from higher yields on some funds while ensuring regular access to their money. This strategy is particularly timely, as it balances the benefits of high rates with the need for liquidity in an unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 49 Democratic members of Congress is urging the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general to investigate the detention of U.S. citizens during immigration enforcement operations. Citing high-profile cases, including the deportation of a 4-year-old with cancer, the lawmakers argue that ICE is violating its own policy and Americans' civil rights. They are demanding a full accounting of the number of citizens stopped, arrested, and detained, particularly amid concerns of racial profiling in Latino and Native American communities. The push for answers comes as Congress has approved record funding for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has dismissed a criminal contempt finding against the Trump administration concerning the deportation of over 250 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. A lower court judge had found that officials willfully disregarded his order to halt the deportations, which were conducted under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act without due process. However, a divided D.C. Circuit panel ruled that the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions" like foreign policy. The ACLU, representing the migrants, expressed strong disagreement with the decision.</p>

          <p>Shares of ad-tech firm The Trade Desk experienced their worst day on record, falling almost 40% after announcing the departure of its CFO, Laura Schenkein. While the company beat second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, investors were spooked by the executive change and growing concerns over competition from Amazon's expanding ad platform. Analysts also noted that potential impacts from President Trump's tariffs on ad spending contributed to the negative sentiment. The company's forecast for the third quarter was also viewed as a potential sign of pressure from the macroeconomic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James as part of an investigation into whether her office's civil fraud probe of President Trump violated his civil rights. According to a source, a separate subpoena was also issued concerning her investigation into the National Rifle Association. The move is seen by critics as an escalation of the Trump administration's use of the justice system for political retribution against adversaries. James's office defended its successful litigation and condemned any weaponization of the justice system.</p>

          <p>A deadline set by President Donald Trump for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine has expired, leaving markets to watch for potential U.S. action. Trump had threatened to impose steep "secondary tariffs" of around 100% on Russia's trade partners if Moscow did not end the invasion. Despite a recent meeting between a U.S. envoy and President Putin, which Trump called "highly productive," the president later expressed disappointment. The White House maintains that its priority is a negotiated end to the war, but key differences over territory and NATO ambitions remain significant obstacles to a peace deal.

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" turns 100, this article reflects on its lasting power as a masterpiece of midlife crisis and its ability to resonate differently with readers at various stages of life. The story, which unfolds over a single day, juxtaposes the societal anxieties of its 51-year-old protagonist with the post-war trauma of a young veteran. While often read in youth as a critique of a declining bourgeois order, the novel offers a profound exploration of mortality, memory, and the affirmation of life. The article argues its themes are deeply personal and enduring, solidifying its place as a classic.</p>

          <p>The digital advertising market is seeing a resurgence, largely driven by the successful implementation of AI tools by tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, which both reported strong quarterly earnings. Meta's CEO credited AI with improving ad system efficiency, leading to a 22% sales increase. However, this growth is not universal, as smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results. Snap's revenue growth was modest after a botched platform update, while Pinterest cited tariff-related concerns and reduced spending from some advertisers, highlighting a growing performance gap in the tech sector.

In a memo, Mr. Tan defended his career, stating he has always operated with the highest ethical standards. The unusual public pressure on a corporate executive has raised concerns about political influence and adds to the challenges facing the U.S. semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>
