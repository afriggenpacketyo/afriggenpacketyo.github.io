She never married, adopting two children, and found profound beauty in art, photography, and the enduring memories of past loves like Al Pacino. Her fierce independence and capacity for deep connection defined her remarkable journey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new UC Irvine study reveals that dietary fiber, specifically inulin found in vegetables like onions and garlic, can reshape gut bacteria to prevent fructose from damaging the liver. Researchers found that gut microbes metabolize fructose in the small intestine before it overwhelms the liver, thereby reducing fat buildup. This groundbreaking discovery suggests that feeding gut bacteria with inulin can reverse signs of fatty liver disease and boost natural antioxidants. The article emphasizes that this insight could lead to personalized nutrition strategies for metabolic health.</p>
