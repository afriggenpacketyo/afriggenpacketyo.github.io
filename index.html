          <p>SpaceX successfully launched the Ax-4 mission, carrying an international crew of first-time space fliers from India, Poland, and Hungary, led by veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson, to the International Space Station. The Crew Dragon spacecraft, making its maiden flight, lifted off from Kennedy Space Center, marking Axiom Space's fourth private astronaut mission. The crew will spend two weeks on the ISS conducting science research, technology demonstrations, and educational events. Whitson, a retired NASA astronaut and now Axiom employee, expressed her excitement in sharing her extensive space experience with the rookie flyers, adding that this mission opens up access to space for countries that might not normally have it. The mission aims to fulfill scientific, technological, and educational goals for the participating countries.</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave has impacted the eastern United States, causing record high temperatures and dangerous conditions for tens of millions of people. The heat dome phenomenon has led to temperatures soaring into the triple digits in some cities, accompanied by extreme humidity. New York City's JFK Airport recorded 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a high not seen since 2013, while cities like Boston and Baltimore also experienced temperatures above 100 degrees. The extreme heat has resulted in heat-related illnesses, disruptions to public transport, and increased demand for power, prompting utilities to urge customers to conserve energy, as well as a surge in sales of air conditioners and fans.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with both Israel and Iran after reported violations marred the initial hours of a recently established ceasefire. Trump announced the ceasefire late Monday, but tensions quickly resurfaced.

The report included satellite images released by Maxar Technologies which showed damage to the Fordo nuclear facility in Iran following U.S. strikes.</p>

          <p>Former and current sexcam models in Colombia have shared experiences of being recruited into the industry while still in school, detailing both potential opportunities and exploitative practices. The global sexcam industry is booming, with Colombia estimated to have the highest number of models worldwide. Models described that some studios use fake IDs for underage performers, and the BBC confirmed that while some studios are well-run and offer support, abuse is rife, and some performers are pressured into streaming for extended periods with little pay. Major webcam platforms have checks in place, but models claim these can be easily bypassed if a studio wants to employ underage performers.</p>

          <p>China and Taiwan are engaged in a dispute over historical interpretations and sovereignty, with Beijing asserting that it cannot "invade" what it considers Chinese territory. China views Taiwan as its own territory and has increased political and military pressure. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te has stated that Taiwan is "of course a country" and China has no legal or historical right to claim it. China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian warned of "resolute countermeasures" against any "independence provocations" from Lai and his administration.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after Apricity Fertility, a popular online firm, went bust, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These clinics act as intermediaries between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not directly regulated by fertility watchdogs. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is calling for stronger laws to protect patients, as these clinics do not provide IVF treatment directly. Several patients have lost significant sums of money, and the HFEA is warning that its protections do not cover these new services.</p>

The deal reflects the political challenge of overhauling environmental regulations to speed up housing construction. The budget relies on borrowing money, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding to address a $12-billion deficit. It reduces the expansion of state-sponsored healthcare to undocumented immigrants and reinstates asset limit tests for Medi-Cal enrollees.</p>

          <p>A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment indicates that recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months. The assessment suggests that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was not eliminated, and the damage was primarily limited to aboveground structures. President Donald Trump has disputed this assessment, asserting that the strikes "completely destroyed" Iran's nuclear sites. The strikes used conventional weapons as well as bunker-busting bombs, believed to be the only bombs capable of destroying Iran's underground Fordo nuclear site.</p>

          <p>A preliminary US intelligence assessment reveals that the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities did not destroy the country's nuclear program, setting it back only by months. The assessment, reported by CBS News, indicates that the Islamic Republic's stockpile of enriched uranium remains largely intact. The White House refuted the assessment, while President Trump maintained that the sites were "completely destroyed". Despite the use of bunker-busting bombs, the deep underground structures of the facilities limited the overall impact of the strikes.</p>

          <h2>Intelligence Assessment: US Strikes Did Not Destroy Iran Nuclear Program</h2>

          <p>A preliminary Pentagon intelligence assessment suggests that U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities did not destroy the country's nuclear program, potentially setting it back by only months. The assessment indicates that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was not eliminated, and the damage was primarily limited to aboveground structures. President Donald Trump has disputed this assessment, asserting that the nuclear sites in Iran were "completely destroyed." The strikes targeted three nuclear facilities with "bunker buster" bombs, but the extent of the damage below the surface remains unclear.</p>
