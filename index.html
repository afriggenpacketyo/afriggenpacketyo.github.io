        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United achieved a vital 3-2 victory against Burnley thanks to a last-minute penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing some relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the win was overshadowed by persistent and critical errors from the team's goalkeepers, including mistakes from both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana in recent matches. These recurring issues have fueled speculation about the club's interest in acquiring Royal Antwerp's goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, before the transfer deadline. The team is also facing potential injury setbacks for key players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount, adding to the challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports and a prominent University of Michigan supporter, appeared on the "Big Noon Kickoff" show in Columbus, Ohio, ahead of Ohio State's game against Texas. Met with boos from the home crowd, Portnoy took the opportunity to taunt the rival fanbase and their head coach, Ryan Day. He suggested that another loss to Michigan could jeopardize Day's job, labeling the coach as "soft" and claiming that the repeated victories by the Wolverines have "broken him." Michigan has defeated Ohio State in their last four encounters, a significant streak in the historic college football rivalry.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed a symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid concerns over a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to prevent city departments from assisting in federal actions that could violate rights to protest and demands that any deployed federal agents be clearly identifiable and not wear masks. Johnson stated he has received "highly credible reports" of an imminent federal presence, prompting this pre-emptive measure to ensure accountability. The White House dismissed the order as a "publicity stunt," contrasting it with what it described as successful federal anti-crime efforts in other cities.</p>

          <p>New evidence suggests that famed Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, whose life inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. It was long believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him, but a renewed investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found inconsistencies in his statements. Modern forensic analysis, including a new autopsy after exhumation, indicates the crime scene was staged and that a gunshot wound to Pusser's own face was likely self-inflicted. Prosecutors believe if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough evidence for a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children, 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, with 18 other people injured. The incident occurred during a school Mass, where the 23-year-old shooter, identified as Robin Westman, fired a rifle through church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot. Authorities are investigating the motive, noting the shooter had an obsession with past mass shootings and left behind anti-Catholic writings.

          <p>Lee Roy Jordan, a legendary linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys and a key member of the famed "Doomsday" defense, has passed away at the age of 84. Jordan played his entire 14-season career with Dallas after being a first-round draft pick in 1963 from the University of Alabama. He was instrumental in leading the Cowboys to their first-ever championship in Super Bowl VI and was a five-time Pro Bowler. After his retirement in 1976, he was inducted into the team's Ring of Honor and remains second on the franchise's all-time tackles list.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on most global imports are illegal, stating he overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The decision, which the administration plans to appeal, affects levies imposed on numerous countries, including China, Canada, and Mexico. However, the ruling does not impact sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum or those from Trump's first term. The outcome introduces significant uncertainty into the administration's trade agenda, potentially reducing the scope of affected U.S. imports from 69% to 16% if upheld. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among health experts suggests that parents should cautiously manage their children's screen time based on developmental stages. The general recommendation is to be screen-free until age three, as young children need to explore their physical environment to develop motor skills and attention control. For preschool children, a maximum of 30 minutes is advised to encourage imagination and social interaction. As children enter elementary school and adolescence, supervised screen time can be gradually increased, but the focus should remain on quality content and open communication to avoid potential online dangers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of expanding "expedited removal" to deport undocumented immigrants from the interior of the U.S. without full court proceedings. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the practice of detaining immigrants who cannot prove they have been in the country for over two years with little to no due process is unlawful. While the ruling does not prevent arrests at locations like courthouses, it significantly curtails the government's ability to bypass the immigration court system. The judge's opinion emphasized that the administration's legal arguments could threaten the due process rights of all individuals.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared that the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, three weeks after the last new case was identified. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. An investigation traced the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new measures to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and expanding the health department's inspection capacity.</p>

          <p>Thousands of vulnerable Afghans who fled the Taliban and are waiting in Pakistan for promised German visas are living in constant fear of deportation. After escaping Afghanistan in 2021, many who had worked for international entities were approved for admission to Germany but have been stuck in a prolonged bureaucratic process. Pakistani police have been conducting raids and arresting undocumented refugees, with a temporary pause on deportations set to expire. The German government, after facing legal pressure, has announced it is resuming the processing of applications, offering a glimmer of hope for families facing imminent danger if sent back.</p>

          <p>A new stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence could significantly speed up the diagnosis of serious heart conditions, according to a British study. The device analyzes heartbeat and blood flow sounds that are undetectable to the human ear and uses an AI algorithm to identify signs of heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds. In a study involving over 200 GP surgeries, the AI stethoscope was found to be substantially more effective at detecting these conditions compared to traditional methods. Researchers believe the tool could be a "game-changer," allowing for earlier treatment and better patient outcomes.</p>

Parubiy was a prominent figure during the 2014 Euromaidan protests and later served as secretary of the National Security and Defence Council. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a "terrible murder," and authorities are investigating all possible motives, including potential Russian involvement.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger" stars Peter Dinklage as the titular mutant hero, offering a well-made and surprisingly sincere version of the Troma classic. Directed by Macon Blair, the film pits its hero against a villainous pharmaceutical CEO played by Kevin Bacon, retaining the original's gory violence and crude humor but with a higher production value. This updated version grounds its story in an emotional core, as Dinklage's character is a janitor and widower trying to raise his stepson. While entertaining, the film's polished nature may feel disconnected from the deliberately cheap and offensive style that defined the original.</p>

Unions have been scrambling to support members affected by immigration raids and are bracing for the impact of Medicaid cuts and a weakened National Labor Relations Board. While some national unions have found common ground with the administration on trade, many local labor groups feel they are under attack. Experts warn that federal hostility and budget cuts could lead to significant challenges for the labor movement, particularly for public sector and healthcare workers.</p>

          <p>The term "red pill," originating from the 1999 film 'The Matrix,' has evolved into a central metaphor for a global online subculture known as the "manosphere." This ideology often promotes misogynistic views, conspiracy theories, and the idea that feminism oppresses men. Initially used by "pick-up artists," the concept has spread through online forums and social media algorithms, influencing figures like Andrew Tate and seeping into mainstream political discourse. While its core is in the U.S., the red pill movement has adapted globally, merging with local cultural and religious contexts while feeding on the insecurities of young men.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire in northern Napa County has burned through thousands of acres, causing an estimated $65 million in agricultural losses, primarily impacting wine grape growers. Wineries like Robert Craig on Howell Mountain have lost entire crops to either direct fire damage or controlled burns set by firefighters to protect nearby towns. This event compounds the financial devastation from previous wildfires in 2020 and 2018, which also destroyed vines and tainted grapes with smoke. The recurring threat of wildfires has shaken the California wine industry, raising concerns about its long-term viability and leading to prohibitively expensive insurance costs for many family-owned vineyards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the rules for collecting Social Security survivor benefits, which are available to eligible spouses, ex-spouses, and children of a deceased worker. Generally, a widow or widower must be at least 60 years old (or 50 with a disability) to claim these benefits, though there are exceptions for those caring for young or disabled children. A key strategy discussed is the ability to claim survivor benefits first while allowing one's own retirement benefit to grow, potentially switching to the higher personal benefit at age 70. The article advises consulting a financial professional to navigate the complexities. (not investment advice)</p>
