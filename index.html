            <p>The Trump administration is considering axing funding for NPR and PBS, alleging they are left-leaning and a waste of taxpayer money. A White House memo claims evidence exists against the outlets, citing a PBS documentary allegedly "making the case for reparations" and a segment on PBS' Washington Week that supposedly "covered up Joe Biden’s clear mental decline." NPR responded that eliminating funding would devastate communities relying on public radio for news, culture, emergency alerts, and public safety information, emphasizing its mission to serve the public interest. The memo did not actually indicate its intention to pull funding.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield edged lower on Tuesday to around 4.316%, a reprieve after a volatile week in the bond market that saw a significant surge in yields. The volatility was fueled by President Trump's tariff policies, raising concerns about who is selling off Treasurys. Analysts suggest factors like concerns over U.S. debt, potential hedge fund selling, and increased CDS spreads for U.S. debt may have contributed to the sell-off. China is America's second largest foreign creditor after Japan, holding about $760 billion in Treasury securities. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a Supreme Court ruling that the government must "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's release, the administration claims its role is limited to removing domestic obstacles.

Shapiro claims the $185 million "owed to Pennsylvania" supports academic and mental health programs, technology modernization, and infrastructure improvements.

            <p>Lawyers for the Justice Department and Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, are scheduled to appear in federal court after the President of El Salvador stated he will not return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The Trump administration faces scrutiny following a Supreme Court ruling that said it must facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from a Salvadoran prison. Justice Department officials have argued that their obligations are limited to removing any domestic obstacles that would impede his ability to return to the U.S. The U.S. is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to house migrants at CECOT.</p>

            <p>Charities are criticizing the government for cutting funding for therapy for adopted children in England by 40%. Adoption UK described the news as "distressing" for families, who had already faced delays in finding out if the fund would continue. The therapy limit has been cut to £3,000 per year, while separate funding for specialist assessment has been axed. The government says the move will "ensure the fund is financially sustainable to allow more vulnerable children to access targeted support."</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is buying 50 shares of Amazon, citing its recent pullback, and selling 50 shares of TJX Companies to lock in gains. Despite Morgan Stanley analysts lowering their 2026 earnings per share estimate for Amazon, the trust believes the company will emerge as a market-share winner. The trust is also taking advantage of the strength in TJX Companies, which has been outperforming the market, to reallocate capital. From the TJX sale, the trust will realize a gain of more than 100% on stock purchased in August 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>New research indicates that monoclonal antibodies, specifically omalizumab, may offer a universal allergy cure by targeting the underlying pathways driving allergic reactions. Omalizumab, an asthma medication, has shown success in treating seasonal, food, and insect allergies in preliminary trials. These artificial proteins instruct the immune system to block receptors that create allergic reactions, preventing the overresponse that releases histamine. Large clinical trials are underway, with the potential for this treatment to provide months of relief with just one injection.</p>

            <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to terminate a Biden-era program that granted legal status to migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti. The ruling, in federal district court in Boston, prevents the wholesale shutdown of the program, which was set to expire on 24 April. The program has allowed more than 500,000 people to legally enter and work in the US since its inception. The Trump administration had argued the plan exacerbated issues with immigration by granting protections to “a substantial population of aliens in the interior of the United States without a clear path to a durable status”.</p>

She brought her grandson's favorite toy, Tamir, on the journey, learning about the rocket's launch and landing procedures. King described the experience as "peaceful" and "oddly quiet" and said she felt she could take on anything after stepping out of her comfort zone.</p>

            <p>A deadly fire aboard a cargo ship at Port Newark in July 2023 was ignited by a Jeep that dripped “flaming fireballs” while pushing vehicles on board, according to the NTSB. The board found that the unrated Jeep was being used beyond its capacity to push vehicles into position. Additionally, a carbon dioxide fire suppression system was ineffective due to a garage door that could only be closed from inside. The NTSB also criticized the Newark Fire Division for exposing firefighters to unnecessary risk, as they lacked familiarity with marine firefighting and a fire control plan for the ship.</p>

The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said the four men were involved in trafficking the ants to markets in Europe and Asia. KWS also stated that the illegal export of the ants undermines Kenya’s sovereign rights over its biodiversity and deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits.

The council will focus collections on the "poorest parts" of the city that have been most affected by the bin strike. Hundreds of bin workers began an all-out strike on 11 March, leading to bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish piling up on streets.  The dispute centers around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles from some bin workers.</p>

The Trump administration claims that Harvard has failed to live up to the "intellectual and civil rights conditions" that justify federal investment.</p>
