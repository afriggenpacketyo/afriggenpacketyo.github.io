          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully penetrated Israeli air defenses and struck the Ramon International Airport near Eilat in southern Israel. The impact on the passenger terminal caused damage, including shattered windows, and resulted in one person being treated for light shrapnel wounds. While the Israeli military intercepted most of the drones in the barrage, the Houthis claimed the attack as a "qualitative military operation" and warned that other sensitive targets are under threat.</p>

          <p>Large-scale protests have erupted in Israel, with over 15,000 people gathering in Jerusalem and others in Tel Aviv to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he is ready to move to a "second phase" of sanctions against Russia over its ongoing war in Ukraine. While he has previously threatened further punitive measures, this is his most direct indication that an escalation of economic pressure is imminent, though he did not specify what the new sanctions would entail. The statement suggests a more aggressive U.S. posture as the administration seeks to compel Moscow to end the conflict, with officials floating ideas like secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil.

Officials are reportedly considering both additional military bases and other "non-military" locations for temporary housing as they face the challenge of a rising number of Channel crossings.</p>
