This comes after the US Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign nationals, a ban which the university challenged and obtained a temporary restraining order against.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a construction site in Tokyo injured ten people after a maintenance vehicle caught fire.

The blast caused damage to windows and shutters of nearby buildings, with witnesses reporting black smoke rising after hearing what sounded like thunder.</p>

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore to Singapore due to economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A six-story facility called "The Reserve" near Singapore's airport, holding about $1.5 billion in gold and silver, has seen an 88% increase in storage orders since the start of the year. Singapore is considered a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, and the wealthy are opting for physical gold bars over paper to avoid counterparty and geopolitical risks. The rise in gold prices has been fueled by volatility from U.S.-China trade tensions and a mass U.S. asset sell-off.</p>

Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, to identify and remove fake reviews.

BYD shares plunged after the company announced price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers to address the practice of marking cars as sold to meet targets, which are then resold as secondhand vehicles. An analyst expects BYD's vehicle margin to be under pressure in the short term due to the price cuts, but anticipates the company will offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee has criticized the MTR Corporation for "inadequacies" in emergency responses and contingency planning following recent service disruptions, including a five-hour suspension on the Tseung Kwan O line. Lee outlined areas for improvement, emphasizing that prevention is better than rectification. The MTR Corporation was fined HK$19.2 million for the disruptions, equivalent to a day of half-price fares for passengers. Lee stressed that the corporation needs to take comprehensive action to prevent future incidents, highlighting the government's concern over the rail operator's performance.</p>

          <p>Deaf, disabled, and neurodivergent public figures have launched the #TakingThePIP campaign to protest potential benefit cuts in the UK. The proposed cuts to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and the health element of Universal Credit could severely impact disabled individuals, affecting their ability to afford essential equipment and support. The campaign highlights the struggles disabled people already face, including rising homelessness and food bank usage. Advocates argue that the cuts will not save money but will lead to greater costs and widespread suffering, demanding the government stop taking the Pip.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for a second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures, supported by Beijing's policy measures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% year-on-year, accelerating from 2.6% in March. The growth was largely attributed to Beijing's efforts to support the private sector, offsetting some negative impacts from U.S. tariffs. While some industries faced headwinds, such as the automobile and apparel sectors, overall profitability improved due to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks.
