          <p>The UK government is proposing a wider ban on destructive bottom trawling in its offshore areas, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where pressure is mounting for countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats, with the hope of benefiting both nature and climate. This ban is a win-win for both nature and the climate, which is why it is being enacted.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 34.5% year-on-year in May, marking the sharpest decline since February 2020 due to prohibitive tariffs. Overall exports rose 4.8%, missing expectations, while imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Despite the trade surplus increasing to $103.2 billion, the data underscores the impact of trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. China's exports of rare earths also dropped, reflecting tightened export controls. The economic effects will be closely monitored.</p>

In May, China exported $28.8 billion worth of goods to the US, down from $33 billion in April.

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a strong backlash following President Trump's deployment of national guard soldiers in response to protests against immigration raids. The city is reacting with fury to the administration's intensified immigration enforcement, which has included raids without judicial warrants and reports of families being separated. Protests have escalated, with clashes between federal agents and demonstrators, leading to arrests, including union leaders. Trump's actions have been criticized as a deliberate strategy to target a Democratic city, sparking widespread outrage and resistance. This has led to the deployment of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops arrived in Los Angeles following violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters triggered by immigration enforcement operations. Protesters clashed with soldiers near the Metropolitan Detention Center, resulting in the use of tear gas and non-lethal rounds. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell cited compliance with the California Values Act, limiting their involvement in immigration enforcement. President Trump deployed the guard, calling the events "violence, clashes and unrest." Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as "purposefully inflammatory." The protests reflect growing tensions over immigration policies and federal intervention in local affairs.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for a fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic consumption. The consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.1% year-on-year, despite analysts' expectations of a slightly larger drop. A bruising price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices contributed to the downward pressure. Policymakers have urged the automotive industry to halt price wars to improve profitability and efficiency. With exports holding strong, China needs to rely on domestic demand to combat deflation.

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning a trip to the United States this week for a sixth round of talks aimed at securing concessions on tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Ryosei Akazawa, minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy, will meet with U.S. officials ahead of the G7 summit in Canada. The Japanese government is urging the Trump administration to remove the tariffs, which are impacting Japan's export-oriented economy. Discussions will cover trade expansion, non-tariff barriers, and bilateral cooperation on economic security. The two countries are working to find common ground.</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles has become a scene of pandemonium as protests against immigration officials turned violent, leading to the deployment of National Guard troops. Critics of President Trump argue that his decision to deploy the National Guard, against the wishes of the state's governor, has inflamed tensions. The 101 Freeway was closed due to clashes between police and protesters, with projectiles hurled towards police and tear gas used in response. The military was deployed to guard federal buildings, including the Metropolitan Detention Centre. The events have drawn strong reactions from politicians on both sides, condemning the violence but disagreeing on the root causes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new travel ban, restricting citizens from twelve countries, mainly in Africa and the Middle East, went into effect. The ban restricts nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering the U.S. The ban is broader than Trump's initial 2017 travel ban and is expected to withstand legal challenges. Critics argue that the ban disproportionately affects non-white countries in the developing world, fueling accusations of racism. The new ban does not revoke visas previously issued but will reject new applications unless they meet specific exemption criteria.</p>
