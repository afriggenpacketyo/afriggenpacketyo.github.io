          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown at midnight due to a legislative stalemate between Democrats and Republicans. Disagreements center on health care policy, with Democrats demanding Medicaid overhauls and extended tax credits, while Republicans push for a short-term funding agreement. A shutdown could furlough millions of federal workers, including essential personnel, without pay and halt various agency operations, potentially costing the economy billions. Past shutdowns, like the 2018-2019 event, have caused significant economic disruption and hardship for federal employees.</p>

The deal, which Harvard has not yet confirmed, reportedly includes the university operating trade schools focused on AI and other fields. This follows months of accusations and federal funding cuts by the Trump administration, which a federal judge recently ruled unlawful. The administration has targeted several universities over various issues, with Columbia and Brown also reaching settlements.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed Micah Parsons' claim that Jones never contacted him after Parsons was traded to the Green Bay Packers. Jones stated he stopped calling Parsons because the player had previously asked him to remove his number. Despite the 40-40 tie between the Cowboys and Packers, Jones expressed satisfaction with the trade, believing it was the right move for the team. Parsons recorded one sack and three tackles in his return to Dallas, reflecting on the 'painful' experience of playing against his former quarterback.</p>

          <p>The commercial exploitation of valuable deep-sea minerals, abundant in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans, is currently on hold. This delay stems not from technological limitations but from a lack of clear international legal frameworks. The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN agency, is tasked with establishing a comprehensive mining code, but its finalization is stalled by growing environmental concerns. This situation creates a challenge for countries like China, while the U.S. continues its push into deep-sea mining exploration.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier publicly condemned WNBA leadership, including Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, regarding officiating inconsistencies and player welfare. Speaking at her team's end-of-season press conference, Collier, a WNBA Players Association executive council member, stated the league's lack of accountability undermines the sport's integrity. Her comments followed an ankle injury from an uncalled foul and her coach's subsequent suspension and fine for criticizing officials. Collier described leadership's approach as "tone deaf" and "dismissive" in addressing critical player issues.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man attempting a 20-mile marathon swim from Santa Catalina Island to San Pedro was bitten by a 3-to-4-foot shark early Tuesday. The "rare attack" resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to the swimmer's leg and foot, who was awake and conversing when rescued. Emergency services quickly responded, transporting him to a non-trauma facility. Authorities noted the swimmer and his crew departed at midnight to avoid busy shipping lanes, and an LAFD captain remarked on the unusual nature of a shark attack in that area.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to reduce disaster relief and anti-terrorism funding for states with "sanctuary" policies. California, alongside ten other states and D.C., argued these cuts illegally cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. The states contended that the funding, authorized post-9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, is crucial for first responders and disaster preparedness, distributed evenhandedly for decades. Attorney General Rob Bonta hailed the decision as a victory against unlawful, politically motivated funding grabs, emphasizing the life-and-death stakes involved.</p>

          <h2>Government Shutdown Could Cause Minor Delays for Government-Backed Mortgages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A looming U.S. government shutdown is expected to have minimal impact on most mortgage applications, as private lenders will continue operations. However, borrowers seeking government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, VA, or USDA could experience minor delays due to potential worker furloughs. The National Flood Insurance Program, managed by FEMA, may also be affected, potentially delaying flood insurance acquisition for homebuyers in high-risk zones. While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac operate independently, they rely on federal services like IRS tax transcript verifications, which could create bottlenecks.</p>

          <p>California startup Aetherflux is advancing the concept of space-based solar farms, planning to launch satellites next year that use infrared lasers to transmit power to Earth. Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt, Aetherflux CEO, explains the system involves a constellation of satellites distributing power to small ground stations. Initially partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense to address battlefield power needs, the company aims to scale up for broader markets. Backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the challenge lies in making the technology cost-competitive with existing energy sources.</p>

          <p>A legal dispute has emerged over the control of the prominent 1-800-GAMBLER national problem gambling hotline, fueled by a surge in legal betting. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), which has leased and operated the helpline since 2022, saw a 34% increase in call traffic. However, the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey (CCGNJ), the number's owner, now wants it back, refusing NCPG's renewal request. NCPG argues CCGNJ lacks resources to staff it, while CCGNJ accuses NCPG of "weaponizing the number" for data.</p>
