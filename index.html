          <p>A late-night shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in three fatalities and ten injuries. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel confirmed the deceased were adults and that two of the wounded were juveniles. Authorities have one person with a weapon in custody and noted that police had responded to a prior incident on the same block over the weekend. The motive for the shooting, which involved numerous rounds being fired on a residential street, remains under investigation as the community grapples with the violence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. national deficit is currently exceeding 6% of GDP, a level significantly higher than the historical average, prompting concerns about the nation's fiscal stability. Prominent economists and investors, including Ray Dalio and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, warn of potential fallout in markets, the economy, and international relations. The article explores how persistent deficits could lead to inflation, higher interest rates, and a diminished capacity for the government to respond to emergencies or fund essential services. Experts suggest the U.S. has a limited window to alter its fiscal course before severe consequences become unavoidable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Critics Argue New Medicaid Work Requirements Will Harm Vulnerable Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 07:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law implementing a nationwide work requirement for Medicaid is facing criticism from budget analysts and health advocates. While proponents claim the measure protects the program from fraud, opponents argue it will strip coverage from millions and create significant bureaucratic hurdles. The article suggests that most non-disabled Medicaid recipients who can work are already employed, and the new rule will function primarily as a burdensome reporting requirement. This could lead to people losing essential health coverage due to administrative complexity rather than a refusal to work, imposing high costs on both individuals and taxpayers.

          <p>Recent polling in Germany indicates a decline in support for the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD), which would receive only 13% of the vote if an election were held now. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative CDU/CSU alliance has gained ground, polling at 30%, while the far-right AfD remains strong at 23%. The survey highlights key public concerns, including the economy, immigration, and social injustice, with a majority of Germans also favoring the reintroduction of compulsory military service. These trends reflect a challenging political landscape for the current coalition government.</p>

The policy prioritizes those who pose a national security threat or have a criminal history, but critics fear it could be used to target political opponents, drawing parallels to its use during the Red Scare. While the Supreme Court limited this power in 1967, an exception for unlawfully procured citizenship is being utilized.

          <p>South African cricket captain Wiaan Mulder made the unusual decision to declare his team's innings while he was personally on the verge of a historic record. Mulder was 367 not out, just 33 runs shy of breaking Brian Lara's legendary record for the highest individual score in a Test match, which stands at 400. Instead of pursuing personal glory, he prioritized his team's strategic position in the second Test against Zimbabwe. His score still stands as the fifth-highest individual innings in Test cricket history and the best ever by a South African.</p>

          <p>International LGBTQ+ travelers are increasingly choosing destinations other than the United States, citing concerns over anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and policies. Travel platforms and companies report a significant drop in bookings to the U.S. from European and Canadian users, who are instead opting for trips within their own countries or to more inclusive destinations. This shift reflects a form of economic activism, as travelers use their budgets to support welcoming economies. The trend could have a notable financial impact, as the LGBTQ+ travel market represents a significant and affluent segment of the global tourism industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are meeting at the White House, presenting a united front after recent joint strikes against Iran. However, a key focus of the discussion is the ongoing war in Gaza and the push for a ceasefire agreement. The U.S. is reportedly pressuring for a deal that would pause fighting and secure the release of hostages, but significant hurdles remain, particularly Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war. The meeting underscores the complex diplomatic landscape, balancing the U.S.-Israel alliance with the administration's goal of achieving a broader Middle East peace.</p>

Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The amendment to the Employment Rights Bill aims to give people time to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward in recognizing all pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement, helping to remove the stigma and provide crucial support for families during a traumatic time.</p>

Methane, a colorless and odorless gas, can cause asphyxiation in high concentrations.

However, countries not making sufficient concessions are still expected to face higher tariffs. This development introduces a new variable into the administration's trade strategy, suggesting a degree of flexibility for allies while maintaining a hardline stance against others, particularly those not engaging in what the White House deems productive talks.

The country's broad price measures have been negative for over a year, and consumer prices have fallen for four consecutive months, fueled by intense price wars. Analysts argue that simply trying to reduce overcapacity is insufficient and that the root cause—diminishing household income expectations and downturns in the property and financial sectors—must be addressed directly.

The government will have to defend its position that it can deport noncitizens whose presence it deems a threat to U.S. foreign policy.

Analysts point to several factors, including rising national debt, aggressive tariff policies, and deep political divisions, which may be eroding international investor confidence. While some economists see the slump as a natural market correction after years of a strong dollar, others view it as an acceleration of a trend where countries diversify away from the U.S. currency.
