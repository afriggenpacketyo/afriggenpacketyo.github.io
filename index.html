          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on six individuals accused of trafficking cocaine from South America to the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean. The sanctioned individuals, including Guyanese and Colombian nationals, allegedly utilize boats and "narco subs" to transport tons of cocaine. U.S. officials state that Guyana has become a major hotspot for cocaine trafficking due to its proximity to the Caribbean and alleged corruption at its ports and borders. Authorities have discovered record amounts of cocaine in homemade "narco subs" traversing through the country's jungles, with these vessels capable of transporting up to 3 tons of cocaine at a time. The sanctions block any property or interests of the designated individuals within the United States and require reporting to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.</p>

          <p>The judge presiding over Sean "Diddy" Combs' criminal trial threatened to remove him from the courtroom for allegedly nodding and making faces at the jury. The judge deemed his actions "absolutely unacceptable," and Combs' attorneys assured the court it would not happen again. The trial involves charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, to which Combs has pleaded not guilty. The court also heard testimony from a woman, using the pseudonym "Jane," who described her relationship with Combs and alleged coercive sexual encounters.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Policy Ineffective for Supply Chain Issues, US Panel Told</h2>

          <p>Witnesses testifying before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission stated that President Trump's tariff policy is ineffective and counterproductive for addressing US supply chain problems. They called for comprehensive and structural responses, including rebuilding US industrial capacity and ensuring China is not part of crucial supply chains. One economist noted that US sanctions and tariffs are accelerating China's efforts to strengthen its manufacturing capacity. This perspective suggests a need for alternative strategies to address supply chain challenges.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Tesla CEO Elon Musk, calling him "CRAZY" and suggesting that the government should terminate contracts with his companies. Trump's comments followed Musk's criticism of a major tax bill. Musk responded by indicating that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. The exchange highlights a significant rift between the two figures and raises questions about the future of government contracts with Musk's various businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli officials reportedly armed a Palestinian militia to fight Hamas in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged working with "clans" but did not confirm the arming of a militia. Opposition leader Yair Lapid warned that weapons provided to these groups could eventually be used against Israeli soldiers and civilians. The move raises concerns about the long-term stability and security implications of arming local factions in the conflict.</p>
