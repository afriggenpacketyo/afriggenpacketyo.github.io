          <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, is urging the government to ban AI apps that create sexually explicit images of children, citing disproportionate targeting of girls and young women. She highlights the increasing number of AI-generated child sexual abuse reports and the fear it instills in children, who are changing their online behavior to avoid becoming victims. The government states that creating such material is illegal and it has introduced further offences for creating, possessing or distributing AI tools designed to create such content.</p>

          <p>Trump Coins, a venture launched by Donald Trump, attributes the soaring value of gold to Trump's "return to the spotlight." However, experts dispute this, citing financial uncertainty caused by Trump's economic policies, including tariffs, as the real driver. They argue that rising gold prices often indicate economic turmoil, referencing the 2008 crisis and the Ukraine invasion. While Trump Coins sells gold medallions, experts suggest ETFs as a better investment strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brood XIV, a massive group of periodical cicadas, is expected to emerge across the eastern United States in the spring of 2025. These cicadas, known for their loud buzzing and synchronized behavior, will primarily appear in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller quantities in other East Coast states. The timing of their emergence is linked to soil temperature, with cicadas exiting the soil when it reaches 64 degrees. The adult cicadas will remain above ground for 4 to 6 weeks, engaging in mating rituals before laying eggs and dying.</p>
