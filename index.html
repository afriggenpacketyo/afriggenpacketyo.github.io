The video, recorded in 1999, was unsealed as part of a lawsuit against the Saudi government. Retired FBI supervisor Richard Lambert believes the video shows pre-operational surveillance of the Capitol, potentially linked to the hijackers on Flight 93. Former CIA analyst Gina Bennett concludes that the man who made the video was an al-Qaeda facilitator. Optimism score: 20</p>
