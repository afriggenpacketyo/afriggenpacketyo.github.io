            <h2>Experts Warn of Potential Heart Health Risks Associated with Tongue Scraping</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 05:00:16 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>While tongue scraping has been used for centuries to improve dental health, experts are now warning about potential heart health risks associated with the practice. Dr. Bradley Serwer cautions that tongue scraping can cause microscopic cuts on the tongue, which can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. Dr. Whitney White advises gentle scraping in moderation to avoid disrupting the balance of good microbes on the tongue, which help produce nitric oxide, important for heart health. Experts recommend prioritizing regular dental visits, brushing, and flossing for healthy gums and teeth.</p>

            <p>In Austin, Texas, a family continues the tradition of making cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, for Easter, a practice started by Denise Solis' mother, Rosemary Valdez, before she passed away from stomach cancer. The tradition connects Solis to her mother and is a way of showering her child with love and care. Cascarones, common in Texas and Northern Mexico, symbolize rebirth and fertility, and are broken over each other's heads during Easter celebrations. This tradition has been a part of Texan Easter celebrations since the state was part of Mexico, connecting families to the past.</p>

            <p>China is showing a shift in its approach to African conflicts by directly asking Rwanda to end its backing of the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This is a departure from China's usual non-interference policy, as Beijing works to protect its mining interests and relationships with both countries. China also voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution that unanimously condemned Rwandaâ€™s role in the conflict. The move reflects China's need to balance its diplomatic relationships with protecting its economic interests in the region.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to delays for shipments over $800, however, business-to-business shipments will still go ahead. The White House is also set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu. These companies have warned that they will increase prices due to the changes in global trade rules and tariffs.</p>

            <p>Two people were killed in Moore, Oklahoma, after heavy rainfall caused vehicles to be swept off the road due to flooding. Emergency responders recovered the bodies of an adult female and a 12-year-old child outside one of the submerged vehicles. The flooding occurred as more than 30 million Americans are under alert for severe weather this Easter weekend, with several states in the Heartland already experiencing tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds. The Moore Police Department reported assisting over a dozen motorists whose vehicles were stuck in high water, describing the event as a historical weather incident.</p>

            <p>Five international students from India and China have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the termination of their F-1 visas. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, claims the administration unilaterally terminated the visas of numerous international students without proper notice, causing financial and academic hardship. The students face potential deportation and are struggling to complete their degrees. The lawsuit argues that the government's actions violate due process and create uncertainty for international students in the US, particularly those from China and India, who comprise a large portion of the international student population.</p>

            <p>The popularity of snail slime in beauty products has raised ethical concerns regarding the treatment of snails. While the industry claims snails are treated humanely, some methods of slime extraction involve stressful or harmful techniques. PETA has warned that snails can feel stress, pain, and fear, and studies have revealed practices such as electrical stimulation and the use of force to increase slime yield. The article questions the consumer's willingness to overlook the snails' well-being in pursuit of beauty, and suggests that tariffs might be a more effective deterrent than animal welfare organizations.</p>

            <p>The author reflects on the changing landscape of America, contrasting the open and generous spirit they once knew with the current state marked by closed borders and disillusionment. They recall memories of a welcoming America, filled with unique and fantastical experiences, from the quirky art found in junkyards to the breathtaking landscapes. They express a sense of loss for the America that embraced both its grand illusions and its inherent openness, contrasting it with the current political climate and the rise of careerism. The author keeps their memories of America in a metaphorical 'genizah,' hoping for a future return to the values they once cherished.</p>

            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Donald Trump's demands for Harvard to reorganize its governance and hire faculty to ensure viewpoint diversity are a form of political bullying. While viewpoint diversity is important in universities, Trump's approach is a pernicious form of identity politics that could undermine scholarly objectivity. The author contends that fostering freedom of expression and encouraging a richer culture of debate are vital, but affirmative action for political viewpoints is not the solution. Instead, the focus should be on cultivating the capacity to move between different points of view.</p>

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are expected to increase their market share in China due to rising demand for fresh, naturally ripened fruit.

Improved logistics and steady supply have boosted Malaysian durian exports to China, with distributors reporting a 30% increase in exports this year.
