          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou is facing significant pressure after failing to secure a win in his first seven games. The team's poor form, characterized by a vulnerable defense, has placed them just above the relegation zone, prompting speculation about his future. Postecoglou acknowledged the difficult start and expects to discuss the club's direction with the owner, but remains defiant, stating he "loves a fight" and is confident in his long-term vision. The article notes that while a recent pragmatic shift in tactics failed to prevent another loss, the upcoming international break is seen as a crucial period for training and implementing his style.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime and protect federal assets, a move strongly opposed by state and local leaders as an abuse of power. The decision follows a tense incident where federal agents shot an armed woman after their vehicles were reportedly rammed during immigration-related protests. This deployment is part of a broader administration strategy of sending federal forces to Democrat-led cities, raising constitutional questions about the use of military for domestic law enforcement. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker accused the administration of manufacturing a crisis to justify the intervention.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has identified the immediate release of all hostages from Gaza as the most critical and urgent phase of the new peace plan proposed by President Trump. As negotiators prepare for talks in Cairo, Rubio emphasized that discussions should focus on the logistics of the release, which he stated must happen quickly and cannot be delayed. The plan, which Hamas has partially agreed to, involves exchanging Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Rubio acknowledged that establishing a stable, terror-free Gaza will be a longer-term challenge but stressed that securing the hostages' freedom is the essential first step.</p>

          <p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has accused Democrats of not being serious about negotiations to end the ongoing federal government shutdown, which has entered its fifth day. Johnson asserted that the House has passed a funding measure and the responsibility now lies with the Democrat-controlled Senate to resolve the impasse. In response, Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of dishonesty, particularly regarding healthcare benefits, and criticized President Trump's divisive rhetoric. With formal talks stalled for nearly a week, both parties are attempting to gain a political advantage in the court of public opinion.</p>

          <p>Sussex Police are investigating a suspected arson attack at a mosque in Peacehaven, East Sussex, as a hate crime and have released images of two men they wish to identify. The fire, which occurred on Saturday night, damaged the building's entrance and a vehicle, though no one was injured as two people inside managed to escape. The incident has prompted an increased police presence and reassurance patrols at other places of worship, occurring shortly after a deadly attack at a Manchester synagogue.

          <p>Two years after the October 7th attack, Israel has only partially achieved its stated war aims of recovering all hostages and destroying Hamas. While some hostages have been returned and key Hamas leaders eliminated, the group still operates, and dozens of hostages remain in Gaza. The conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties and widespread destruction, leading to international condemnation, accusations of genocide, and arrest warrants for Israeli leaders from the ICC. The war has also significantly weakened Israel's regional adversaries like Hezbollah and Iran, but has spurred increased international recognition of Palestinian statehood and fragmented Israeli society over the war's direction.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny hosted the season premiere of "Saturday Night Live" and used his opening monologue to address the political controversy surrounding his upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. He humorously pushed back against threats from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who suggested immigration agents would be present and that only Americans should attend. Bad Bunny, who is an American citizen, spoke in Spanish to celebrate the indelible contribution of Latinos to the country, telling non-Spanish speakers they have "four months to learn."

The incident led to a tense standoff between protesters and federal law enforcement at the scene, with DHS deploying special operations teams to control the crowd.

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has defended her leadership approach, acknowledging that her party may pay a short-term "price" in opinion polls but insisting her patient strategy will "pay off eventually." Speaking at the start of the party's conference, Badenoch argued that unlike Labour or Reform UK, she refuses to "rush out" new policies, preferring to take the time to develop them properly. This defense comes as the party faces poor polling numbers and has lost support to the rival Reform UK party.

          <p>A new study based on nearly two decades of NASA satellite data reveals a concerning trend: the Northern Hemisphere is absorbing more solar energy and becoming darker relative to the Southern Hemisphere. This growing imbalance is primarily caused by the loss of reflective surfaces like sea ice and snow cover in the Arctic, as well as a decline in sunlight-scattering aerosols due to cleaner air policies. Scientists warn that this "broken symmetry" could alter global wind and ocean currents, which are crucial for redistributing heat around the planet. The trapped excess energy may intensify warming and extreme weather events, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>

Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words used in a conversation. A sharp, sarcastic, or indifferent tone can turn a simple question into an accusation, triggering defensiveness and escalating conflict. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate arguments by becoming self-aware, apologizing for a harsh tone, and rephrasing their statements.

          <h2>Democrats are embracing the risky politics of a government shutdown to rein in president, activists say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 11:54:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For months, as Donald Trump has used the levers of the US federal government to consolidate power, silence dissent and punish his political enemies, Democrats have been bombarded with a single demand: do something. Last week, they did. In a rare display of unity, out-of-power Democrats embraced the risky politics of a government shutdown – their boldest effort yet to rein in a president whom many Americans and constitutional scholars now view as a threat to US democracy. “It’s not a fight for fighting’s sake,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the outside groups closely coordinating with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. “This is a battle about Donald Trump’s attacks on the constitution and him seizing the power over all spending from Congress – and whether Congress is going to let him get away with that.” Washington is bracing for what could be an extended government shutdown, which officially began at 12.01am on Wednesday. Last week, Senate Democrats repeatedly blocked a Republican funding measure to reopen the government, as the parties traded blame and each side insisted they would not bend to the other’s demands. Democrats are pressing for an array of healthcare-centered priorities, including the extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans set to expire at the end of the year. The White House and Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have refused to include any healthcare concessions as part of a deal to reopen the government, though some GOP lawmakers are open to extending the ACA subsidies. Democrats, with little leverage and deep skepticism that Republicans will honor any future deal, view the shutdown as their only option to force the issue. But the Trump administration is working to make the closures as painful as possible for Democrats, who Republicans accuse of trying to “sabotage” the president’s agenda. Trump has called the shutdown an “unprecedented opportunity” to dismantle federal programs and what he called “Democrat agencies”. In a sharp break from precedent, the Trump administration is readying plans to permanently layoffs of federal workers while it takes punitive action against Democratic-led states. Several government departments have posted partisan and potentially illegal messages saying their operations are curtailed due to “the Radical Left Democrat shutdown”. In the Senate, the majority leader John Thune has said he plans to hold more votes on a plan to reopen the government this week. But Democrats say the stakes are too high – and the greater risk is capitulating to the president. “Remember, right now, our healthcare system is broken. Right now, we’re the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,” the senator Bernie Sanders said in a video with progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, explaining the Democrats’ opposition to the Republican funding bill. “And these guys want to make it even worse. We’re not going to let that happen.” Progressive activists who have been sharply critical of the party’s congressional leaders, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, are now praising them for continuing to “hold the line on healthcare”. “What our members see is Democrats willing to stand up and fight,” said Joel Payne, a spokesperson for MoveOn, which is part of a coalition of progressive groups flooding Democrats with calls to hold fast in shutdown negotiations. Payne said healthcare was Democrats’ “north star” – the party’s strongest issue with voters and one that has helped propel them to victory in the past. If Democrats are successful, he added, the showdown over healthcare could serve as a blueprint for safeguarding other rights under attack by the administration. House Republicans did not need Democrats to pass their short-term spending bill last month, which would fund the government mostly at current levels through 21 November. But in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, they need Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation. So far, only three members of the Senate Democratic caucus have broken ranks: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King, an independent of Maine. In the House, Maine congressman Jared Golden, was only House Democrat to back the Republican funding bill when it passed the House last month. In a statement last week, Golden said the shutdown was the “result of hardball politics” driven by the demands of “far-left groups” eager to show their opposition to Trump. Early polling suggests voters are more inclined to blame Trump and Republicans than Democrats for the federal shutdown. A Washington Post poll released on Thursday found that, by a 17-percentage-point margin, Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown. Independents overwhelmingly sided with Democrats, the survey found. Yet there were signs public opinion could shift as more Americans face the ripple effects of government-wide closures. In several polls, a significant share of voters said they held both parties equally responsible or were unsure of whom to blame. The call for Democrats to take a harder line against Trump has been building for months. Across the country, progressive activists, disaffected Republicans and voters outraged by the administration’s actions have packed town halls, marched in protests and launched campaigns of their own – sending a clear message to Democrats: step up, or step aside. “Everybody wants a fighter,” said Lanae Erickson, senior vice-president at the centrist thinktank Third Way that is often at odds with the party’s left flank. Erickson said the focus on healthcare – an issue that unifies the party’s diverse coalition and falls squarely in the “Venn diagram of things voters care about” – was both good politics and good policy. “The ACA subsidies are a real ask,” she said. “If Democrats got that, it would be a way to declare victory in this moment.” Democrats feel confident going to battle over healthcare. A Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll showed that 78% of Americans support extending the credits, which disproportionately benefit Republican-held congressional districts. Without action, insurance premiums for millions of Americans could double next year, according to an analysis by KFF. Democrats have also sought to reverse Medicaid cuts included in Trump’s marquee tax-and-immigration package, which the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects will leave 10 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade. Republicans have countered by falsely claiming Democrats forced a shutdown to provide free health benefits to undocumented immigrants. The White House has taunted Democrats with a deepfake video of Schumer and Jeffries, wearing a sombrero and fake mustache that has been widely denounced as racist. Vance laughed off the criticism, calling the video “funny”. Democrats like Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, fired back with memes and taunts of their own. In one tweet, Newsom’s press team posted an AI generated image of Trump in a towering wig and an 18th-century gown: TRUMP “MARIE ANTOINETTE” SAYS, “NO HEALTH CARE FOR YOU PEASANTS, BUT A BALLROOM FOR THE QUEEN!” Democrats are betting that the shutdown strategy can help shift momentum heading into next year’s midterm elections. By wielding their most powerful legislative tool, party leaders aim to rebuild trust with their disillusioned base – a group whose frustration has dragged Democratic approval ratings to decade lows and hurt fundraising. Many Democrats argue that their best hope of restraining Trump is to regain the House in 2026, and that the most straightforward path to doing so is to focus on kitchen-table issues like healthcare. Some Democratic strategists warn that by focusing primarily on healthcare, the party risks downplaying what many view as Trump’s authoritarian lurch – reducing it to just another policy showdown in Washington’s partisan budget battles. Anat Shenker-Osorio, a Democratic strategist and communications researcher, believes a sharper message – such as “we will not fund fascism” or “no dollars for dictatorship” – would help cut through the noise and clarify the stakes. “In order for people to fight this regime, they have to understand it as a regime hellbent on taking our freedoms,” she said. As part of their demands, Democrats are also pushing for ways to curtail Trump’s ability to rescind funding already approved by Congress, as he has done with foreign aid programs and public broadcasting. An alternative short-term funding bill offered by Democrats included provisions that would make it harder for the president to undermine Congress’s funding power. Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible and a leading voice on the left pushing Democrats to fight harder against what he calls the Trump “regime”, said he was encouraged to see the party’s leadership sharpen its tactics. Though Levin shares the view that the stakes are far bigger than a healthcare policy dispute, he believes Democrats’ demands, if met, could “constrain the regime in some meaningful ways”. Indivisible is helping to coordinate a second wave of No Kings rallies across the country to protest what organizers described as Trump’s “authoritarian power grab”. The day of action, planned for 18 October, will be another opportunity to mobilize Americans and, Levin hopes, to celebrate Democrats for their resolve. “I hope what we will not be doing is criticizing them for having surrendered again,” he said. “So the play is to win.”</p>

          <p>In a unified and politically risky move, Democrats are leveraging the government shutdown to challenge President Trump's actions and push for their healthcare priorities. Activists and party leaders view this as a necessary fight to rein in a president they see as a threat to democratic norms and to prevent him from unilaterally controlling federal spending. By blocking Republican funding measures, Democrats aim to force concessions, particularly the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. While Republicans accuse them of sabotage, early polling suggests the public is more inclined to blame the GOP, and Democrats are betting the focus on healthcare will resonate with voters.</p>

          <p>The success of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program in the United States has brought the country to the brink of achieving herd immunity against the primary cause of cervical cancer. A long-term study found that high, gender-neutral vaccination rates have dramatically reduced infections from cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women. This indirect protection demonstrates the powerful community-wide effect of the vaccine. Experts emphasize that maintaining these high vaccination rates is crucial to sustaining this protection and fulfilling the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem globally.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to give police new powers to impose conditions on repeated protests, allowing them to consider the "cumulative impact" on communities. This could enable police to restrict the location or duration of demonstrations that have occurred multiple times in one area. The move follows a weekend of mass arrests at a pro-Palestine Action protest and comes amid concerns that certain communities, particularly the Jewish community, feel intimidated and unsafe. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the policy is about balancing the right to protest with residents' right to live without fear, while critics argue it undermines fundamental civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, faces a significant challenge to its communication strategy due to new political ad bans on major social media platforms. Fidesz has been one of the biggest political ad spenders in the European Union, often outspending all opposition parties combined and even the total political ad spend of entire countries. In response to the ban, Orban has launched a "fight club" initiative to recruit online activists, or "digital freedom fighters," to spread the party's message organically. This shift occurs as Fidesz's main challenger, Peter Magyar, gains significant traction through grassroots campaigning and a strong organic social media presence.</p>

          <p>A series of small earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near the Big Bear area in San Bernardino County late Saturday and early Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenters were located in the San Bernardino Mountains, producing weak shaking that was noticeable indoors but unlikely to cause damage. The area has a history of seismic activity, with the last major events being the magnitude 6.3 Big Bear and magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquakes, which struck on the same day in June 1992. The recent cluster serves as a reminder of the region's active fault lines, though these minor temblors are common.</p>

          <p>George Russell secured a victory for Mercedes at the Singapore Grand Prix, but the race was marked by escalating tensions between McLaren teammates and title rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. An opening-lap collision, where Norris made contact with Piastri while passing him, led the Australian to protest the move as unfair over team radio. The incident puts McLaren's internal policy of free but contact-free racing under scrutiny, especially following other recent team decisions that have favored Norris. Despite the internal friction, McLaren successfully clinched the constructors' championship for the season, a testament to their car's consistent excellence and strong driver performances.</p>

The process has drawn criticism for its lack of transparency and the significant power it grants to the interim president, who will directly appoint an additional 70 members.
