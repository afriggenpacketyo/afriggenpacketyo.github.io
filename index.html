          <p>Two Scottish men, identified as Eddie Lyons Jnr and Ross Monaghan, were shot dead at a bar in Fuengirola, Spain. Monaghan had previously been acquitted of a gangland murder and had been shot in 2017, while Lyons Jnr had also been shot before his death. The shooting occurred when a masked gunman opened fire at Monaghans Bar on Saturday evening before fleeing in a vehicle. Local media reported the attack took place just after 23:00 when a car pulled up outside the crowded bar.</p>

          <p>White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated he is confident that courts will support President Trump's tariff agenda, despite a recent federal court setback. An appeals court issued a temporary stay protecting the tariffs during litigation, pausing a decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade that blocked the tariffs. Hassett argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president the authority to impose tariffs. He added that the White House has studied every possible way to pursue Trump's tariff agenda and is confident in its legal soundness.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential runoff election between Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by the governing Civic Coalition party, and Karol Nawrocki, endorsed by outgoing President Andrzej Duda. Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, has promised to soften Poland's abortion ban and protect LGBTQ rights. Nawrocki, a historian, is skeptical of the EU and campaigns as a defender of traditional Polish values. Polls suggest a very tight race with different ideological paths for Poland.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri won the Spanish Grand Prix after Max Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for causing a collision. Verstappen almost lost control of his car during a restart, leading to contact with Charles Leclerc and George Russell.

Piastri's win moves him into a 10-point lead over Norris in the championship, while Verstappen is now 49 points behind Piastri.</p>

The accident may have been caused by fatigue and excessive speed, according to the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). The state governor declared a day of mourning and announced that the victims' families would receive financial assistance and food supplies. The FRSC recorded 9,570 road accidents and 5,421 deaths in Nigeria last year.</p>
