          <p>The FBI's art crime team successfully returned a 16th-century manuscript page, signed by Hernán Cortés, to Mexico after it went missing decades ago. This historically significant document details early payment structures for spice land discoveries, offering unique insights into the planning of expeditions to the Americas. The page, part of Mexico's national archives, was recovered from a U.S. location following a request from the Mexican government. No prosecutions will occur as the document changed hands multiple times since its theft.</p>

          <p>U.S. producer prices unexpectedly surged by 0.9% in July, marking the largest monthly increase since June 2022 and surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 0.2%. This significant rise, particularly in services inflation and machinery wholesaling, suggests that inflationary pressures persist in the economy. While consumer prices have remained softer, businesses may soon pass on rising costs to consumers. This report could temper optimism for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next month.

Kim reportedly misled investors by claiming the losses were due to a "treasury management strategy" rather than personal gambling.

          <p>The trial regarding President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles concluded, with U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer questioning the limits of presidential authority. California Governor Gavin Newsom sued, arguing the deployment for immigration enforcement violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The Justice Department contended the act didn't apply and the court lacked jurisdiction for an injunction. Judge Breyer expressed concern over the apparent "absence of any limits to a national police force" and the justification for continued military presence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to seek Congress's approval for "long-term" federal control over Washington D.C.'s police department, signaling intentions to extend his unprecedented federal takeover beyond the initial 30 days. Trump cited an "out of control" crime problem, a claim disputed by D.C. leaders who report declining violent crime rates. This move has raised concerns about presidential overreach and the potential for similar federal interventions in other Democrat-led cities, as Trump expressed a desire for nationwide legislative changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's portrayal of Washington D.C. as crime-ridden contrasts sharply with federal data showing violent crime at a three-decade low. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser disputes Trump's "hyperbolic" characterizations, emphasizing declining crime numbers. However, a significant portion of residents still perceive crime as a serious problem, illustrating a gap between data and public sentiment. Experts suggest policymakers should base strategies on data while also addressing the public's feeling of safety, acknowledging that even with declines, crime rates may still be too high.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the Trump administration's cuts to science research funding across federal agencies, including NIH and NSF, threaten its stated goal of expanding U.S. dominance in AI. While the administration released an "America’s AI Action Plan," these cuts undermine the foundational research environment that fostered AI's development. Concerns also arise regarding AI safety, as the plan seeks to remove guidelines on misinformation, diversity, and climate change, potentially exacerbating biases in AI systems.
