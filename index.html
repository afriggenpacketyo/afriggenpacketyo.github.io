          <p>A former Royal Marine, Paul Doyle, has pleaded not guilty to 31 charges, including causing grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving. He is accused of deliberately driving a car into crowds of Liverpool FC fans celebrating the club's Premier League victory parade on May 26, an incident which injured over 130 people, including children. Doyle appeared in court via videolink from prison to enter his plea. His legal team has reported significant difficulties in accessing him while in custody, stating that the current system is impeding their ability to prepare his defense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll indicates widespread dissatisfaction among German voters with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government, with 77% unhappy with the infighting between his conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD). This mirrors the unpopularity of the previous government, which collapsed over similar disputes about the budget and social policy. The current conflicts center on Merz's push for welfare cuts, which the SPD opposes, preferring tax hikes on the wealthy. While the government's focus on migration and economic relief has satisfied its conservative base, only 25% of SPD voters approve of its performance.</p>

          <p>A video from a roller-skating rink in China's Hunan province captures a chaotic scene where a single woman's fall triggered a massive pile-up involving numerous other skaters. The footage shows the initial skater losing her balance, leading to a domino effect as others behind her are unable to stop in time. The incident resulted in a large group of people entangled on the floor of the rink. The brief article does not provide details on whether any serious injuries occurred as a result of the mass collision.</p>

          <p>A new political poll suggests Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is on track to win the 2026 state election in Saxony-Anhalt with a projected 39% of the vote, significantly ahead of the conservative CDU at 27%. This potential victory could make forming a government without the AfD nearly impossible, challenging the "firewall" policy where other parties refuse to cooperate with them. The AfD's rise has been bolstered by the retirement of the popular state premier and comes despite the party being officially classified as right-wing extremist in the state, increasing pressure on the CDU to reconsider its stance.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing growing domestic and international pressure to support EU sanctions against Israel for its military actions in Gaza, which a majority of observers believe have violated international humanitarian law. Despite a growing number of EU nations favoring sanctions, Germany's opposition is a significant obstacle due to its population size and historical responsibility to Israel. German public opinion is shifting, with polls showing strong opposition to arms exports to Israel, but the government has so far maintained its position of "criticism without consequences." Legal challenges and increasing political isolation may eventually force a change in Berlin's policy.</p>

          <p>The firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by Donald Trump has sparked concern among economists about the potential politicization of vital economic data. The dismissal came just hours after the agency released a disappointing July jobs report and made significant downward revisions to previous months' figures, which Trump claimed were "RIGGED." While the BLS's day-to-day operations have not yet changed, the nomination of E.J.

          <p>The global buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure could become a market worth between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by the end of the decade, creating a massive opportunity for key semiconductor companies. Nvidia, the leading designer of AI-powering GPUs, is positioned as a primary beneficiary as tech giants like Meta and Alphabet increase their capital spending on AI. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which manufactures approximately 90% of the world's advanced chips for Nvidia and others, also stands to gain significantly from the broad-based demand across the industry.

          <p>The death toll from the derailment of a historic funicular streetcar in Lisbon has risen to 17, with an additional 21 people injured. The victims included multiple nationalities, reflecting the popularity of the 19th-century "Elevador da Gloria" as a major tourist attraction. The crash occurred when the out-of-control streetcar derailed and struck a building with brutal force. Portugal is observing a national day of mourning in response to the capital's worst disaster in recent memory, as investigators work to determine the cause, with a faulty brake or snapped cable being considered.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage testified before a U.S. congressional committee, urging American politicians and businesses to challenge the British government on its freedom of speech regulations, which he compared to those of North Korea.

Farage was criticized by Democratic representatives, who labeled him a "Putin-loving free speech impostor," while Prime Minister Keir Starmer accused him of "badmouthing" the country abroad.</p>

          <p>The Texas state Senate has passed a first-of-its-kind bill that would permit private citizens to sue anyone who manufactures, distributes, or delivers abortion pills into the state. The measure, which Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign, would award successful plaintiffs up to $100,000 in damages. This legislation expands on Texas's existing strict abortion ban by specifically targeting out-of-state providers and networks that mail the medication, which is used in the majority of abortions in the U.S. The bill is expected to trigger significant legal challenges over its enforceability across state lines.</p>

Beijing stated the tariffs were the result of an investigation which found that U.S. exporters were altering trade patterns to circumvent existing duties.

          <p>British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner may face a fine from tax authorities in addition to paying an estimated £40,000 in underpaid stamp duty on a property she purchased. The issue revolves around whether the flat she bought was a second home, which carries a higher tax rate. Rayner claims she was misinformed by lawyers, but tax experts suggest this may not be a sufficient defense to avoid a "carelessness" penalty, which could be up to 30% of the owed tax. The dispute centers on complex tax rules related to a trust established for her son.</p>

          <p>France is facing a period of significant political and economic instability, leading some economists to label it "the new Italy," a country historically known for such challenges. Persistent infighting between political parties, unresolved budget disputes, and a high budget deficit have raised concerns in financial markets. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou faces a crucial vote of confidence next week over a contentious 2026 budget, and a loss would lead to the fifth prime minister in less than two years. This contrasts with Italy, which has experienced a period of relative stability under its current government. (not investment advice)</p>

The rule was established following a campaign by the parents of Martha Mills, a 13-year-old who died from sepsis after her family's warnings were dismissed. A pilot program at 143 hospitals has already seen nearly 5,000 calls, leading to hundreds of potentially life-saving interventions.
