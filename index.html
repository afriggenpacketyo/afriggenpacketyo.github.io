            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were preparing to deport Venezuelans accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, potentially subjecting them to persecution in El Salvador. The Trump administration is expected to challenge the temporary order, while the ACLU continues to fight the deportations, citing due process concerns.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from 6 p.m. Saturday to midnight Sunday, ordering a halt to all fighting. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement, calling it a manipulative tactic, especially after drone strikes were recorded in Ukrainian airspace. The announcement follows U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement that the Trump administration is ready to move on from peace talks if progress isn't made soon. The situation remains tense, with ongoing fighting reported in the Kursk region.</p>

            <p>American grandparents are increasingly taking on caregiving roles, leading to changes in their relationships with their children and grandchildren. As grandparents provide more childcare, their own retirement plans are often disrupted, and their relationships with their children can become more transactional. While grandparents can offer closeness, love, and wisdom to children, these bonds can strain when caregiving responsibilities become overwhelming. The article explores the evolving dynamics of grandparenting in modern society.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt to the deportation of Venezuelan men in immigration custody, following concerns that they were at imminent risk of removal without judicial review. Lawyers for the ACLU argued that the men were classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and faced deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that deportations under the AEA can only proceed if individuals have a chance to argue their case in court.</p>

Retirement savings of $2 million, plus Social Security payments, could last anywhere from just 23 years in Hawaii to 72 years in West Virginia, according to a recent GOBankingRates analysis. The analysis considered typical retiree expenses and adjusted them for each state using cost-of-living indices. Housing costs are a primary driver of the differences.</p>

The shift could lead to a humanitarian crisis and destabilize the region, potentially impacting U.S. interests. The Trump administration's policies are also tarnishing America's legacy as a refuge for persecuted people.</p>
