          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from using National Guard troops and other military forces for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the state challenging the deployment of troops during protests over immigration policies. Judge Charles Breyer determined the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the military's role in civilian law enforcement, warning against the creation of a national police force controlled by the president. The decision has been temporarily stayed to allow for a federal appeal.</p>

          <p>In a sharply critical op-ed, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "endangering every American's health." The bipartisan group of former leaders condemned his recent actions, including the firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and the replacement of members on a key vaccine advisory committee. They argue that these moves politicize public health and undermine the agency's ability to protect the nation from health threats, calling on Congress to exercise its oversight authority.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) will be honored with the Television Academy's Governors Award, a top industry prize, even as it prepares to shut down after its federal funding was eliminated. The organization, which has supported PBS, NPR, and iconic programs like “Sesame Street” for nearly 60 years, is being recognized for its profound and lasting contributions to television. The award will be presented at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony in September. The closure of the CPB, following a bill signed by President Trump, is expected to have a significant impact on public media, especially in smaller communities.</p>

          <p>In an effort to win back customers affected by inflation, McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" menu with discounted offerings. The promotions, starting September 8, will include deals such as a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. This move addresses a recent decline in traffic from low-income consumers, which the company's CEO noted has been in the double digits. By re-emphasizing value, the fast-food giant aims to boost sales, particularly during breakfast, and better compete for the spending of financially pressured diners.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have arrested three dockworkers in Sydney after discovering 1,116 pounds of cocaine, with a street value over $107 million, hidden in a shipping container. The drugs were concealed behind a false wall in a container sent from Europe. The arrests are part of a targeted operation against "trusted insiders" within supply chains who facilitate drug smuggling for organized crime groups. One suspect was caught exiting the container with tools allegedly used to access the hidden compartment. All three men face charges that could result in life imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Banking experts are advising savers to consider their strategy for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) this September, as interest rates are expected to decline following a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. Recommendations include locking in current high rates now, considering flexible no-penalty CDs, and using a "CD ladder" strategy to balance access to funds with earning potential. Experts emphasize the importance of not locking up too much cash in long-term CDs to maintain liquidity for unexpected expenses, especially given current inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that President Trump's new tax legislation, the "big beautiful bill," creates a "golden opportunity" for more investors to qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket. With new and higher deductions for 2025, individuals with taxable income below $48,350 (or $96,700 for joint filers) can sell appreciated assets without paying taxes on the profits. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting" during lower-income years or resetting an asset's cost basis to reduce future tax liabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's stock fell about 6% following the announcement. CEO Bill Newlands noted a deceleration in high-end beer purchases, particularly among Hispanic consumers, who are a key demographic for the company. Constellation now anticipates a drop in organic net sales and has lowered its earnings per share outlook, attributing the decline to reduced trip frequency and lower spending by consumers.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields jumped as a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, raising the possibility that the government may have to refund billions of dollars. This prospect has created concern over the U.S. fiscal situation, leading to a sell-off in government bonds and causing yields to rise. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4.27%, while the 30-year yield surpassed 4.96%. The court's decision, which the administration plans to appeal, could force a surge in Treasury issuance to cover the refunds, putting further pressure on government finances.

          <p>In a landmark U.S. case, an identical twin has been convicted of a crime using advanced DNA analysis that can distinguish between twins. Russell Marubbio was found guilty of a sexual assault that occurred in Virginia in 1987 after forensic scientists identified minute, acquired mutations in the DNA. Standard DNA tests are typically inconclusive for identical twins, but Parabon NanoLabs used whole-genome sequencing to find subtle genetic differences between Marubbio and his brother. This pioneering technique, which successfully identified the perpetrator from a 37-year-old crime scene sample, was admitted as evidence in a U.S. court for the first time.</p>
