          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to peak above 30 degrees Celsius. The heat has prompted amber health alerts in southern England and wildfire warnings in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The extreme weather has also affected major events like Wimbledon, where play was halted due to spectators needing medical attention, and has led to travel disruptions and hosepipe bans. Fire officials are urging public caution around water and highlighting the severe risk of wildfires due to the dry conditions.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during a U.S. immigration raid on a cannabis farm in California. While Department of Homeland Security officials state the individual was not being pursued, the United Farm Workers union attributes the death to the enforcement action. The raid, part of a broader crackdown, resulted in the arrest of approximately 200 undocumented migrants and sparked protests. The incident has intensified the debate over immigration enforcement tactics, with President Trump authorizing agents to use necessary means against protestors.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by a majority decision in the final fight of their historic trilogy at Madison Square Garden. The bout, described as a strategic "chess match," saw Taylor retain her undisputed light-welterweight championship in front of a sold-out arena. While not as explosive as their previous encounters, the fight was gripping, with Taylor boxing smartly to secure the win. Following the victory, the 39-year-old champion expressed respect for her opponent but remained noncommittal about her future in the sport.</p>

          <p>An eight-year legal dispute has emerged between a penthouse owner and companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family over a luxury property on Park Lane. The conflict, which began over a lift installation, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the "malicious" use of a noisy lift. This row provides insight into the combative business practices associated with Al Fayed's empire, which appear to persist after his death. The article also notes the building's connection to past sexual assault allegations against Al Fayed.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants, marking their longest losing streak since 2017. Despite a late-game offensive surge that saw them score seven runs and challenge Giants ace Logan Webb, the Dodgers could not overcome an early six-run deficit. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs in under five innings. While the team showed signs of offensive revival, their inability to prevent runs ultimately led to another defeat, narrowing their division lead.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's proposed plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah amounts to a crime against humanity, likening it to a concentration camp. The author, Raja Shehadeh, contends that the dehumanization of Palestinians dates back to the 1948 Nakba and that international law has repeatedly failed to protect them. Despite the West's continued support for Israel and the ineffectiveness of legal institutions, the author finds hope in Palestinian resilience and "sumoud" (steadfastness). The piece concludes that humanity, not law, will ultimately hold Israel accountable.</p>

This trend is marked by tech firms deepening ties with the defense sector, potentially creating a faction of "tech hawks" who advocate for a more assertive stance against China. While many of Trump's tech supporters favor continued pressure to contain China's technological growth, some Chinese scholars believe internal tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA base could ultimately undermine these efforts to reshape U.S. politics and foreign policy.</p>

The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. While the switches were quickly reset, the plane lost power and crashed.

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a U.S. federal court. Prosecutors accused Guzman Lopez of being a high-ranking leader in the Sinaloa Cartel, taking over after his father's arrest and extradition. As part of his plea agreement, he admitted to coordinating the transport of various drugs into the U.S. and agreed to forfeit $80 million. In exchange for his pledge to fully cooperate with authorities, he is expected to receive a reduced sentence.</p>

It has now amassed over three billion Spotify streams, surpassing many hits by global superstars. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes the song's lasting appeal to its relatable, wistful theme of a soured relationship.</p>

          <p>Numerous independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been left confused and "gutted" after the popular soft toy company Jellycat abruptly terminated their supply accounts. The company, which has seen a recent boom in popularity due to social media trends, informed around 100 stores via a generic email that the decision was part of a "brand elevation strategy" and was not negotiable. Shop owners who have stocked the brand for decades feel they are being cast aside in favor of larger retailers, leaving them without a significant source of income.</p>

          <p>A mother in central Gaza is grieving after an Israeli airstrike killed two of her young sons and her niece as they waited for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic. The strike, which the Israeli military said targeted a "Hamas terrorist," killed 16 people, including 10 children. The mother, Iman al-Nouri, rushed to the scene to find her children being transported on a donkey cart, with a third son, two-year-old Siraj, critically injured. The U.S.-based aid group running the clinic condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international law, highlighting that no place is safe in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Perris, California, has issued a public warning urging residents to stay home when possible and be cautious of strangers due to ongoing federal immigration raids in the region. In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas advised the community to "remain calm" and "know your rights" in response to reports of ICE operations. This guidance reflects the heightened fear within immigrant communities in Southern California, where intensified enforcement has been taking place for over a month. The city of Perris, where nearly 80% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, stated its commitment to protecting its residents.</p>

          <p>A 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague has become the focus of a passionate debate between the national Railway Authority and a coalition of architects and preservationists. The authority plans to dismantle the iconic Vysehrad bridge, citing corrosion and the need for a third track to handle growing rail traffic, and move it to a new location. However, an international foundation of experts argues that the bridge can be repaired in place for less money and with minimal disruption. With support from Unesco and a public petition, campaigners are urging the Czech government to preserve the historic landmark.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration raids on two California cannabis farms resulted in the detention of about 200 people, including at least 10 minors, and left some workers critically injured. The United Farm Workers union confirmed the injuries occurred during what it called "chaotic raids" in Ventura County, which also sparked clashes between protesters and federal agents. Federal officials stated the operation was related to the employment of undocumented immigrants and that a protester fired a weapon at agents. The incident has drawn attention to child labor and the widespread fear caused by intensified immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration aimed at reducing its workforce. The cuts, which include 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, have targeted numerous offices, including those focused on refugees, human rights, and foreign assistance. Critics, including Democratic senators and the American Foreign Service Association, argue the indiscriminate cuts will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security. The layoffs are part of a broader plan to streamline what the administration calls a "bloated bureaucracy."</p>
