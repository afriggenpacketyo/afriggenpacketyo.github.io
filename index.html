          <p>U.S. officials confirmed the death of Khamis Ayyad, a Palestinian American, from smoke inhalation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank following a confrontation with settlers. The incident took place in the village of Silwad, where the Palestinian health ministry reported that settlers set fire to homes and vehicles. The U.S. State Department condemned the "criminal violence by any party" and is providing consular assistance to the family. This death is the latest in a series of violent events involving settlers and Palestinians, reflecting the heightened tensions in the region since the October 7th attacks and the subsequent war.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats attempted to negotiate the release of several billion dollars in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a number of President Trump's nominees. According to sources, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought funding for entities like the National Institutes of Health and the World Food Program. However, the deal reportedly fell apart after President Trump rejected the terms, accusing Democrats of "political extortion." The failure to reach an agreement leaves approximately 140 of Trump's nominees awaiting confirmation until the Senate returns from its August break.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey property. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the restricted area. This was one of five unauthorized airspace incursions that occurred over the weekend, prompting NORAD to remind general aviation pilots to check for flight restrictions before takeoff. Officials emphasized that such protocols are mandatory for flight safety and that the flares used pose no danger to people on the ground.</p>

The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), who build military aircraft like the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets, voted against the proposal for their facilities in Missouri and Illinois. The union stated that its members deserve a contract that ensures family security and recognizes their expertise. Boeing expressed disappointment with the outcome, noting its offer included significant wage growth, and has activated a contingency plan to continue operations.</p>

          <p>An Israeli official has indicated that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is increasingly pushing for a "military solution" to rescue the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This shift in strategy comes amid a perceived lack of interest from Hamas in reaching a diplomatic deal, with about 20 living hostages still believed to be in captivity. The news emerges as thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv demand the government prioritize the hostages' return, fueled by a recent video showing a captive in an emaciated state. Meanwhile, concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continue to mount, with significant deaths reported from malnutrition.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has indicated that the new tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration on over 60 trading partners are "pretty much set." This follows a presidential executive order establishing a baseline 10% tariff on all imports, with higher rates for countries like Canada that did not secure a deal. Greer dismissed concerns about complicating trade relations, stating the President's goal is to fix the terms of trade to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The move has created uncertainty in the business community, with economists predicting reduced economic growth due to the trade war.

          <p>A group of 51 Democratic lawmakers have left Texas to prevent a vote on a new congressional map they argue is heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans. By leaving the state, they deny the Republican-controlled legislature the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business during a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott. The proposed map, backed by President Trump, could increase the Republican congressional delegation from 25 to 30 seats. This marks the third time in recent years Texas Democrats have used this tactic to halt Republican legislation, though they face potential fines and threats of arrest.</p>

Local residents also object due to potential security disruptions from protests. The UK government, seeking to balance economic engagement with national security, has taken over the final decision after the local council rejected the plan, highlighting the complex nature of UK-China relations.</p>

While doctors describe it as revolutionary, comparing its impact to the birth control pill, they also caution that it is not a guarantee of a future baby, with success rates diminishing at each step of the process. The procedure is also financially prohibitive for many, with a single cycle costing over $12,000 and many women needing multiple rounds.

Hagedorn stated that both sides are pouring money into these races, which fosters a public perception of the court as an extension of politics.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has signaled a potential shift in strategy, suggesting the company might pursue a major acquisition to accelerate its artificial intelligence roadmap. This has fueled speculation that Apple could be interested in acquiring AI chatbot company Perplexity, which has over 22 million monthly users and a rapidly growing revenue stream. Perplexity's focus on providing direct, real-time answers with cited sources aligns with Apple's user-experience-centric philosophy. Such a deal would be a significant departure from Apple's usual practice of smaller, bolt-on acquisitions and would instantly bolster its position in the competitive AI landscape.

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a jobs report showed downward revisions for previous months. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pointed to the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, though he did not provide specific proof of the data being "rigged" as Trump claimed. The ouster has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, including a Trump-appointed former BLS commissioner, who warn that it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent for politicizing independent statistical agencies.</p>

          <p>A manhunt for 45-year-old military veteran Michael Paul Brown has entered its third day after he allegedly shot and killed four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana.

The victims, all local residents, were reportedly known to the suspect, who lived next door and was a regular at the bar. Family members of the suspect stated that he has struggled with mental illness for years, including PTSD from his military service in Iraq, and that they had repeatedly sought help for him.</p>

In May, White House adviser Stephen Miller stated that the administration was looking to set a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day.

          <p>For the first time, Florida added more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, positioning it as a new leader in the nation's solar energy boom. This growth is primarily driven by utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are taking advantage of streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the falling cost of solar power. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop solar installations. Despite this, large-scale projects continue as solar becomes economically competitive with natural gas, even without subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>
