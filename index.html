          <p>Habibur Masum has been found guilty of murdering his wife, Kulsuma Akter, in a frenzied knife attack in Bradford, UK. He stabbed her over 25 times in the street while she was pushing their infant son in a pram. The court heard that Ms. Akter had been living in a women's refuge after Masum had previously threatened her, and he had stalked her to find her location. Masum had admitted to manslaughter but was convicted of murder after a trial, during which he was described by prosecutors as the "smiling killer."</p>

          <p>The US is set to withdraw from Gavi, a global alliance that provides life-saving vaccines to children in low-income countries, following a decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This move jeopardizes a US pledge of $2.53 billion, which Gavi estimated would save approximately 1.2 million lives by 2030. The decision has been heavily criticized as it stems from the secretary's noted skepticism about vaccine safety, a view that contradicts the global scientific consensus. This action is described as a devastating blow to global public health initiatives.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, as the company contends with declining car sales in key markets like Europe.

          <p>Recent reports and social media stories have highlighted cases of immigrants, some undocumented for decades, choosing to leave the United States, a phenomenon sometimes termed "self-deportation." However, experts caution against viewing this as a significant trend, suggesting it may be part of a political strategy by the Trump administration to create an illusion of high deportation numbers. For those who do leave, the decision is complex and fraught with legal and financial challenges, and many immigrants with deep roots in the U.S. are unlikely to depart voluntarily.</p>

          <p>Quantum computing, a technology being heavily pursued by giants like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, is gaining significant attention despite remaining largely futuristic. Unlike traditional computers using bits (1s and 0s), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once, allowing them to solve certain complex problems exponentially faster. While no practical business applications exist today, the technology holds immense promise for fields like drug discovery, materials science, and code-breaking for national security.

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer recounts her experience moving into an actors' house in Los Angeles and developing a strong infatuation with her charismatic Australian roommate. Just as a romance seemed possible, she pulled back, only to later discover he had a long-term girlfriend and was compulsively seeing other women to cope with his own issues. The experience, while devastating to her romantic fantasy, evolved into a close platonic friendship. It led the author to re-evaluate her ideas about soulmates and finding love in the city.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, has admitted that recent US and Israeli bombings caused "excessive and serious" damage to the country's nuclear facilities. This statement appears to contradict earlier claims from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who asserted the strikes failed to significantly disrupt the nuclear program. The admission comes as Iran's parliament approved a bill to halt cooperation with the IAEA, the global nuclear watchdog. The conflicting messages from Tehran highlight internal divisions and uncertainty following the military escalation.</p>

          <p>Sportswear giant Nike has announced plans to significantly reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing to mitigate the financial impact of US tariffs. The company estimates the trade policies could add around $1 billion to its costs this year. In response, Nike's CFO stated that the percentage of its US-bound footwear made in China will be cut from 16% to a "high single-digit" range by 2026. This move reflects a broader trend of companies diversifying their supply chains amid ongoing trade tensions between the US and China.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has released an unusual number of details about the recent airstrikes on Iran's nuclear sites, revealing it was the culmination of a 15-year intelligence mission. Officials described how analysts studied the heavily fortified Fordo facility for years and worked to develop the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb specifically to destroy it. This public disclosure is seen as an effort by the White House to defend the effectiveness of the strike, countering an initial intelligence assessment that suggested the damage might only set back Iran's program by a few months.</p>

          <p>A new study has identified rocks from Quebec's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt as being approximately 4.16 billion years old, potentially making them the oldest known rocks on Earth. The research, published in the journal Science, used two different dating techniques that yielded the same age, appearing to settle a long-standing scientific dispute. Studying these primordial rocks could offer valuable insights into the planet's formation and the origins of life.

          <p>The UK government's recent reversal on planned welfare cuts is projected to significantly reduce expected savings, creating a budget hole of Â£2.5-3 billion. The original plan to tighten eligibility for disability benefits was expected to save Â£5 billion annually, but after a backbench rebellion, the changes will now be less severe and only apply to new claimants. This partial U-turn means the government will now only save around Â£2 billion a year. This shortfall will likely need to be covered by higher taxes or cuts to other public services.</p>

The review praises the novel for its inventive prose and its argument that confronting difficult collective memories, rather than hiding them, is essential for justice and identity.

While Premier Li Qiang touted strong growth figures, many businesses are struggling with weak domestic consumer demand, a troubled real estate sector, and fierce price wars, particularly in the auto industry. Experts at the conference noted that China's traditional export-led growth model is becoming unsustainable, and a significant boost in domestic consumption is needed to stabilize the economy.</p>

          <p>UK counter-terrorism police have arrested four people following a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, a key military airbase. The incident, claimed by the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, involved activists breaching security and spraying paint on two military aircraft. Three individuals were arrested on terror-related charges, and a fourth for assisting an offender. In response to the security breach, the UK government has announced its intention to proscribe Palestine Action, which would make it illegal to be a member of or support the group.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Government Asks Social Media Platforms to Combat Election Disinformation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 07:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a national parliamentary election in July, the Japanese government has formally requested that major social media platforms like X take stronger measures to counter disinformation. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications asked operators to clarify and expedite their processes for removing harmful and defamatory posts targeting political candidates. This move comes as Japan's political parties jointly express concern that the spread of false information via social media could thwart a free and fair election, though they have not yet agreed on specific regulations.</p>

          <p>New Zealand pop star Lorde kicked off the 2025 Glastonbury Festival with a surprise early-afternoon performance on the Woodsies stage. The secret set drew such a large crowd that the festival had to close the field due to overcrowding. Her appearance coincided with the midnight release of her highly anticipated fourth album, "Virgin," which she performed in its entirety for the receptive audience. The set concluded with two of her biggest hits, "Ribs" and "Green Light," providing an energetic start to the festival's first full day of music.</p>
