          <p>England has reinforced its cricket squad by calling up fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton for the final Test match against India at The Oval. The move provides necessary depth to a pace attack fatigued after a long fourth Test in Manchester. With a tight turnaround before the decisive match, which begins Thursday, England may need to rotate players to ensure the team is fresh. England must avoid defeat in this final game to secure a series victory.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a criminal investigation, Shi Yongxin, the abbot of China's Shaolin Temple, has been formally defrocked. The Buddhist Association of China cancelled his ordination certificate, effectively removing him from his monastic position. This swift action came after accusations of embezzlement and other misconduct, which the association stated had severely damaged the reputation of Buddhism. The move underscores the authorities' commitment to addressing the scandal and holding individuals accountable regardless of their status.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia have convened in Malaysia for urgent talks aimed at resolving deadly border clashes. The negotiations, hosted by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, seek an immediate ceasefire after five days of fighting that has killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The conflict, a rare military confrontation between ASEAN members, has drawn international pressure, with both the U.S. and China attending as observers. Despite the talks, fighting was reportedly ongoing, and trust between the two nations remains low.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for murdering a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy, has died in custody. Czuba was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and hate-crime charges for the October 2023 attack on Wadee Alfayoumi and his mother, Hanan Shaheen. Prosecutors demonstrated that Czuba targeted the family because of their faith and in response to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal attack, in which the boy was stabbed 26 times, deeply affected the local community and renewed fears of anti-Muslim discrimination.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automakers Face Looming Threat from Chinese Competition Despite US Tariff Relief</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 00:01:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a new trade deal lowers US tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, the relief is overshadowed by the larger threat of competition from Chinese automakers. China's rapid rise, particularly in electric vehicles, is eroding Japan's market share in key regions like Southeast Asia and Australia. This external pressure is compounded by domestic challenges in Japan, including weak consumer spending. Analysts suggest that while the tariff deal provides some predictability, the long-term outlook for Japan's auto industry remains challenging due to China's growing dominance.

          <p>After 74 years of scientific expeditions and research, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in Tibet. The groundbreaking ceremony for the massive dam, which is expected to be the most powerful on Earth, was announced by Premier Li Qiang. Chinese scientific study of the region began in 1951, shortly after Tibet's liberation, with early expeditions laying the groundwork for this ambitious engineering project. The dam's construction marks the culmination of decades of planning and exploration on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.</p>
