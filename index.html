          <h2>Texas Officials Scrutinized Over Delayed Emergency Alerts During Deadly Floods</h2>

          <p>Authorities in Kerr County, Texas, are facing intense questioning regarding their response to catastrophic flash floods that have resulted in at least 120 deaths, with over 160 people still missing. Dispatch audio reveals a firefighter requested an emergency alert for residents about six hours before the county's official notification was sent, by which time many were already engulfed by the rising Guadalupe River. Officials have cited challenges like poor mobile service but have deferred providing a detailed timeline of their actions, stating their current priority is the search and recovery effort for the numerous victims, including children from a local summer camp. The federal government has since declared a major disaster in the area.</p>

          <p>American singer Chris Brown has pleaded not guilty to two new charges in a London court, stemming from an alleged assault at a nightclub in February 2023. The 36-year-old artist is accused of striking a music producer with a tequila bottle, leading to charges of actual bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon. These are in addition to an existing charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, to which he has also pleaded not guilty. After being released on a £5 million security fee, Brown is required to reside in the UK while awaiting his October 2026 trial, with arrangements made to allow for international travel for his world tour.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is visiting Texas following devastating floods that killed at least 121 people, offering support without the criticism he has previously directed at state leaders during other crises. Unlike his response to California wildfires, Trump has praised Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican ally, and focused on the federal government's support efforts. The visit occurs as local officials face scrutiny over the timeliness of their emergency warnings. Concurrently, questions persist about the administration's proposed cuts to the National Weather Service and the future of FEMA, which the administration has previously considered phasing out, though officials insist the federal response has been robust.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military ruler, Min Aung Hlaing, has expressed his "sincere appreciation" to Donald Trump after receiving a letter from the U.S. president. The letter, which warned of a 40% tariff, was interpreted by the junta as the first official U.S. recognition of its rule since the 2021 coup. In a detailed response, Min Aung Hlaing justified his seizure of power by drawing parallels to Trump's false claims of election fraud in 2020 and thanked him for cutting funding to U.S.-backed media outlets. He also requested that Trump lift economic sanctions and consider a lower tariff rate to support Myanmar's economy.</p>

The bank plans to integrate Devin into its 12,000-person development team to handle tasks like code updates, aiming to augment its human workforce and potentially boost productivity threefold or more. This move signals a shift toward 'agentic AI,' where programs execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human supervision.

For instance, when asked about the Israel-Palestine conflict or the New York City mayoral race, the chatbot's process showed it was searching for Musk's stance, sometimes citing his views directly in its response. This behavior aligns with Musk's goal of creating an "anti-woke" and "maximally truth-seeking" AI. The launch follows recent controversies where the previous version, Grok 3, generated antisemitic and other inappropriate content, prompting the company to implement stricter hate speech controls.</p>

The order, which sought to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, faced immediate legal challenges upon its announcement. This ruling effectively halts the administration's policy across the entire country, marking a significant legal setback for one of the president's key immigration initiatives. The decision upholds the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil.</p>

A team from Oxford University suggests it originated in the Milky Way's 'thick disk,' a region of ancient stars, and is likely composed of significant water ice. As it approaches the Sun later this year, it is expected to develop a glowing tail, potentially making it visible from Earth with amateur telescopes and offering a rare glimpse into a previously unseen part of our galaxy.</p>

The article suggests U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino could learn from Hiddink's methods, which prioritized fitness and cohesion, effectively turning the national squad into a club-like unit.

However, emergency experts caution that sirens are only one part of a comprehensive warning system and must be paired with public education so people understand what the alarms mean.

          <p>A recent Social Security Administration email claimed President Trump's new tax law eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most seniors, but experts clarify the mechanism is more complex. The law does not directly change how Social Security benefits are taxed; instead, it introduces a new $6,000 standard deduction for individuals aged 65 and older. This will result in more seniors paying no or lower overall income tax, but it primarily benefits middle to upper-middle-income earners. Critics note the tax cuts will accelerate the insolvency of Social Security's trust fund, potentially leading to significant benefit cuts by 2032 unless Congress intervenes.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of contraction and defying analyst expectations of slight growth. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figure "disappointing," as the downturn was driven primarily by a drop in manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, and weak retail sales. This economic fragility complicates the government's fiscal position, which has been strained by recent U-turns on planned spending cuts. With public finances described as vulnerable and businesses scaling back hiring, economists warn that the prospects for medium-term growth appear muted, presenting difficult choices for the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>A fierce price war has broken out in China's 'instant commerce' sector, as major players like JD.com, Alibaba, and Meituan offer massive subsidies to capture market share.

This intense competition has boosted user numbers but has also worried investors, causing the stock prices of Meituan and JD.com to fall.

          <p>Germany's Bundestag is facing a politically charged vote to appoint three new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court, the country's highest court. The process requires a two-thirds majority, creating a complex dynamic where the ruling conservative bloc may rely on votes from the far-right AfD party for its candidate. Meanwhile, the conservatives have moved to delay the vote on one of the Social Democrats' nominees due to controversy over her liberal views and plagiarism allegations. This has prompted the Green party to call for a postponement of the entire vote, labeling the situation disrespectful to the integrity of the court.</p>

Despite its insistence that it is not trying to upend the existing international financial order, skepticism remains, especially in the West.

          <p>The UK government has paused plans to potentially reduce the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) following significant opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer groups. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering the change to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, the backlash from those who warned it would disincentivize saving altogether has led the Treasury to put the move on hold. While future reforms have not been ruled out, the government's immediate focus will shift to other methods of promoting investment, such as education programs and loosening rules on financial advice.</p>

The ban was implemented after the driest spring in a century left reservoir levels at just 50% capacity. However, bill payers point to water pouring down streets from unrepaired pipes, questioning the fairness of imposing restrictions on customers while the utility company, Yorkshire Water, loses an estimated 260 million liters daily to leakage.

This success persists despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk for his political rhetoric, with a recent survey finding 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla for political reasons. Norway's strong pro-EV policies, including tax incentives and robust charging infrastructure, continue to make it a uniquely favorable market for the company.</p>

Trump warned that if Canada retaliates further, the U.S. will increase the tariff rate accordingly. The announcement escalates trade tensions between the two neighbors, with Trump citing unsustainable trade deficits as a major threat to the U.S. economy and national security.
