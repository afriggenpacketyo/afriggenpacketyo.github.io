          <p>Samsung Electronics reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by robust sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The company's revenue increased by 10% year-over-year, reaching 79.1 trillion Korean won ($55.4 billion), while operating profit rose by 1.5% to 6.7 trillion Korean won. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and a global growth slowdown, Samsung anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year, contingent upon a reduction in these uncertainties. Samsung is a leading manufacturer of memory chips and the world's second-largest smartphone maker.</p>

          <p>Mexico's top prosecutor, Attorney General Alejandro Gertz, announced that the Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán was used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel as a recruitment, training, and operations center. This statement clarifies earlier claims that the ranch was an "extermination camp" where human cremations occurred. Gertz stated that investigations found no evidence of cremations, despite the discovery of bone fragments. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities studying the bone fragments to identify them, while also investigating other possible "narco-ranches" in the area. The case was taken over by Gertz's office in late March at the request of President Claudia Sheinbaum due to irregularities in the local authorities' initial investigation.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained unchanged at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were in housing, education, and food, partially offset by decreases in recreation and culture activities. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut rates to 4.1% from 4.35% due to the softening inflation. This data release occurs as Australia prepares for an election on May 3, with the Labor Party holding a four-point lead over the Liberal-National opposition, according to recent polls.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and other Senate Democrats launched an all-night session to criticize President Donald Trump's actions during his first 100 days in office, decrying them as "corruption" and "cronyism."

The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded, stating that Trump has delivered on hundreds of promises, secured the border, and ended inflation. She added that the next 100 days would focus on trade deals, peace deals, and tax cuts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump eased the impact of his new 25% tariffs on the auto industry, aiming to assist manufacturers in relocating supply chains for car parts used in the United States over the next two years. The relief allows American and foreign automakers producing vehicles in the U.S. to claim reimbursements, with manufacturers allowed to offset 15% of a vehicle's suggested retail price in the first year and 10% in the second. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also suggested the United States is close to a tariff deal with India, noting that major U.S. trading partners in Asia have been forthcoming in aiming for deals with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to pay $202 million to the U.S. government and various states to settle civil claims that the drugmaker used speaker programs to pay kickbacks to doctors to induce them to prescribe Gilead's expensive antiretroviral medications to patients with HIV. The programs, which spanned from 2011 through 2017, involved giving money to doctors in the form of honoraria payments, meals, and travel expenses. The arrangement violated the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, causing false claims to be made for Gilead's drugs to be paid for by federal health-care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity fell more than expected in April, dropping to a near two-year low as the escalating trade war with the U.S. negatively impacts bilateral trade. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell below the 50-level threshold, indicating contraction, for the first time since January. This decline follows the imposition of cumulative new tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods by President Trump, with China retaliating with levies of 125% on U.S. goods.

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to disburse congressionally approved grant money to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a federally funded news organization that provides independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the administration to pay the news organization $12 million for its April funding, emphasizing that Congress had ordained the monies should go to RFE/RL. The ruling follows previous attempts by the Trump administration to terminate the grant and exert control over the outlet's programming, which the judge blocked. The news organization was on the brink of collapse before the court reinstated its funding.</p>

          <p>China passed a law to shore up the country's private economy, stipulating measures to promote fair market competition, encourage private firms' involvement in scientific and technological projects, and safeguard their economic rights and interests. The 78-article Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20, aims to protect and promote the non-state sector as the Chinese economy relies more on domestic dynamism amidst a trade war with the US. The law also seeks to prevent local authorities from unfairly targeting private businesses with profit-seeking law enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors, and others complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. Carmakers that pay a 25% tariff on auto imports will not be subject to other levies, and will be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over two years. Despite these concessions, the administration's policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers, according to analysts.</p>

Trump filed the lawsuit alleging CBS deceptively edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
