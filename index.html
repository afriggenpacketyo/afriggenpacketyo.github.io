          <p>Colorado football coach Deion Sanders is scheduled to hold a press conference with his medical team to provide updates on an unspecified health issue. The coach, who has a history of blood clot problems, has been dealing with an illness that limited his involvement in offseason activities. Despite the health concerns, Sanders recently posted a positive message on social media and briefly addressed his status at Big 12 Media Days, stating he is "already back" and handling his responsibilities.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it will begin airdropping aid and establishing humanitarian corridors for UN convoys in Gaza to address a severe hunger crisis. The move follows international pressure and reports of starvation-related deaths and Palestinians being killed while seeking food. While Israel asserts there is "no starvation," witness accounts and health workers describe a grim situation with widespread malnutrition. Aid agencies have warned that airdrops are an inefficient solution to the escalating humanitarian disaster.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has detected and is monitoring a Chinese-flagged research icebreaker, the Xue Long 2, operating off the coast of Alaska. The vessel was found within the U.S. Extended Continental Shelf, an area where the U.S. has exclusive rights to manage resources. This incident follows other recent foreign military activities near Alaska, including the tracking of Russian military planes in the region. The Coast Guard stated it vigilantly monitors such activities to secure territorial integrity and defend sovereign interests.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints that threaten their operation. Under the new proposals, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and processes for opening new establishments would be streamlined. The changes aim to revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry, which has seen a steady decline in the number of pubs. The opposition has criticized the move as hypocritical, citing other government policies they claim have harmed the sector.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a large-scale recall effort, allowing them to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature. The campaign, driven by accusations that the lawmakers were undermining national security, failed to oust any of the targeted officials from the China-friendly KMT party. This outcome ensures that the political gridlock facing President William Lai's administration will likely continue. The opposition has used its majority to stymie Lai's agenda, including cutting defense budgets amid rising pressure from Beijing.</p>

The lawsuit challenges his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the basis for duties on numerous countries. A lower court already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision was paused pending appeal. If the courts ultimately rule against the administration, it could unravel recent trade deals and tariff structures. (not investment advice)</p>

The 27-year-old, who signed a five-year contract, was a top scorer in Portugal, netting 54 goals in 52 games last season. Gyokeres stated that playing against Arsenal's strong team in the Champions League helped convince him to join the club. The acquisition is a major part of Arsenal's summer spending as they look to strengthen their squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that one of two "military-style" grenades is missing from the site of a deadly explosion at a Los Angeles law enforcement training facility. The blast last week killed three veteran deputy sheriffs who were working to render the devices safe. The sheriff stated that detectives had believed the grenades were inert after they were seized a day earlier. An extensive search of the area has not located the second device, and an independent review of the bomb squad's policies has been initiated.</p>
