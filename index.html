          <p>Columbia University will pay $200 million to the federal government and an additional $21 million to the EEOC to resolve investigations into on-campus anti-discrimination law violations. The deal, which Columbia does not admit wrongdoing in, will restore hundreds of millions in federal research grants that the Trump administration had withheld over allegations of antisemitism. As part of the agreement, the university has codified several policy changes, including a ban on masks intended to conceal identity and the hiring of special safety officers. The settlement aims to end a period of federal scrutiny and restore the university's research partnership with the government.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, known as Janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach for the first time in a decade by a Scripps Institute of Oceanography researcher. These pelagic snails, which float on the ocean surface using a bubble raft, are typically found in warmer tropical waters. Their appearance coincides with unusually warm offshore water temperatures, prompting speculation about a potential link to climate change. Researchers are encouraging the public to report any further sightings to help track the species' movement and understand the effects of changing ocean conditions.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to pay the Trump administration $200 million to settle accusations that it failed to adequately protect its Jewish students from antisemitism. In exchange for the payment and policy changes, the federal government will reinstate $400 million in frozen research grants, a crucial source of funding for the institution. The agreement is presented by the administration as a model for other universities facing similar scrutiny over campus protests and diversity policies. This contrasts with Harvard University, which is currently suing the administration over its own funding cuts.</p>

          <p>South Korean manufacturer SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. The surge is attributed to strong global demand and favorable pricing for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies. As a key supplier to companies like Nvidia, SK Hynix has solidified its leadership in the advanced memory market, even surpassing rival Samsung in some areas. The company anticipates continued growth, planning to double its HBM sales for the year and increase capital expenditure in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five men from Las Vegas have been sentenced for their involvement in 'Jetflicks,' a massive illegal streaming service that offered over 183,000 pirated television episodes. The operation, which generated millions in illicit profits, is considered the largest internet piracy case ever brought to trial by the U.S. Department of Justice. The defendants used automated software to acquire and distribute copyrighted content, often making it available to tens of thousands of subscribers within a day of its original airing. The sentences range from time served to seven years in federal prison, marking a significant outcome in the fight against digital piracy.</p>

          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age-verification systems for their users.

However, concerns remain about the effectiveness of these measures, particularly regarding the use of VPNs to bypass the checks, and user reluctance to share sensitive personal data. While major platforms like Pornhub are complying, critics and some users worry the rules will push people to fringe sites or be easily circumvented.</p>

A spokesperson characterized the claims as 'fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media,' although an unnamed official reportedly did not deny his name appears. This development comes as a federal judge in Florida denied a request to unseal grand jury files from Epstein's 2006 case, citing secrecy rules. Meanwhile, there are plans for justice officials to meet with convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, who has also been subpoenaed by a House committee.</p>

Gabbard asserted that the release is meant to prevent the politicization of intelligence and has referred the matter to the Justice Department for investigation.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The panel of judges found the order 'invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship' to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration argued the 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, but the court rejected this interpretation as unmoored from historical legal principles. While the White House plans to appeal, this decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy.</p>

          <p>This article details the origins of the band Black Sabbath and how they invented the genre of heavy metal, following the recent death of singer Ozzy Osbourne at age 76. The band, formed by working-class musicians from Birmingham, reacted against the 'hippy' music of the late 1960s by creating a darker, heavier sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, was central to their sound, featuring detuned, powerful riffs that became a genre template. Despite initial critical dismissal and controversy, the band's influential albums defined a new musical movement.</p>

Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat, a significant shift from his previous stance. The change follows a tense spring training where he and his former manager appeared at odds over his role, which ultimately led to him becoming a full-time DH in Boston.</p>

Proponents of the resolution argue the plan is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, estimating its cost at over $1.3 billion.

As of early evening, no evacuations had been ordered, and fire aircraft were deployed to continue dousing the flames.</p>

          <p>An Afghan interpreter, who saved a U.S. Special Forces officer's life multiple times during the war, has spoken out about feeling betrayed by the United States. After years of hiding from the Taliban, the interpreter was able to immigrate to the U.S. but now fears deportation under new administration policies targeting refugees and even green card holders. The officer he saved decries the 'moral injury' to veterans who see their wartime allies abandoned. The interpreter highlights the contradiction of the U.S. government claiming Afghanistan is safe for return while advising its own citizens not to travel there.</p>

The prison, known as CECOT, is notorious for its harsh conditions, and this is the first time inmates have been released to provide firsthand testimony. Their release was part of a prisoner swap, bringing to light the brutal reality inside the facility.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals that a majority of teenagers are using AI companions, with many interacting with them daily for advice, problem-solving, and emotional support. While some teens use the technology for mundane questions, a significant number report their conversations with AI are as or more satisfying than talking to real friends. Researchers are concerned this trend could hinder the development of crucial social skills, as AI provides constant validation without the challenges of real human interaction. The unregulated nature of these platforms also raises safety issues, as they can produce harmful content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first six months of President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a fiscal year since 2014. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 removals, projecting an annual total over 300,000 if the pace continues. This increase reflects the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, which includes expanded funding and a broader mandate for ICE arrests. However, this total still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational and legal challenges of such a large-scale effort.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a notable bipartisan move, three Republican representatives joined with Democrats to pass the motion, which also seeks communications from former President Bill Clinton and various past and present DOJ officials. The vote reflects growing pressure for transparency after a recent DOJ review asserted Epstein had no 'client list' and died by suicide. The subpoenas signal a significant escalation in the congressional inquiry into the case.</p>

          <p>While still considered a seller's market, the U.S. housing market is beginning to show a slight shift that could benefit homebuyers, according to real estate experts. A key factor is rising inventory, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, the highest rate since 2013. However, median home prices hit a record high in June, partly because many current homeowners with low-interest mortgages are reluctant to sell. Experts advise prospective buyers to look for homes that have been on the market longer or to seek out properties that need updates in good neighborhoods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's 'AI Action Plan' suggests it is a strategy to accelerate AI development by removing regulations and aligning closely with the goals of major tech companies. The plan advocates for stripping away environmental and state-level oversight to speed up the construction of data centers and energy infrastructure. It also promotes a 'try-first' culture for AI adoption across government and industry, including the military, reflecting policy recommendations made by firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Critics argue this approach bets heavily on the tech industry to self-govern, potentially risking public oversight. (not investment advice)</p>
