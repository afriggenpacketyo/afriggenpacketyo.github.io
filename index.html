          <p>Shares for Joby Aviation increased by approximately 14% after the company delivered its first electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to the United Arab Emirates.

The company is also developing four vertiport locations in the region and has received substantial investment from Saudi Arabian firm Abdul Latif Jameel.

The aid system, run by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has been criticized by UN agencies as "inherently unsafe."

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will lose access to a key satellite data program by July 31, just as the U.S. enters peak hurricane season. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), operated by the Department of Defense since the 1960s, will be decommissioned. A naval branch that processes the data for meteorologists is discontinuing its role, citing the need to mitigate a "significant cybersecurity risk." While NOAA assures the public that its remaining data sources are sufficient for high-quality forecasting, the change comes as the agency is already strained by recent staff reductions.</p>

However, many backbenchers are challenging the logic of defining new criteria before a planned review of the assessment process is completed.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to lift some financial sanctions on Syria to help stabilize the country following the recent overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. An executive order is expected to terminate a 2004 declaration that froze Syrian government assets, though other sanctions will remain in place. These include measures targeting the former president, his associates, human rights abusers, and terrorist-affiliated groups. The move follows a meeting between President Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that the sanctions were hindering his transitional government's ability to function and fund reconstruction efforts.</p>

          <p>The seventh installment of the Jurassic franchise, "Jurassic World Rebirth," is being panned by critics as a formulaic and uninspired monster movie lacking the awe of the original. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, follows a predictable plot of adventurers getting chomped on an island, with little character development or suspense. The review criticizes the film for its bloodless action, unconvincing CGI, and brazen product placement. Despite a screenplay by original "Jurassic Park" writer David Koepp, the movie is described as a disappointment that fails to bring any new life to the long-running series.</p>

Democratic committees have vowed to fight the effort, stating it would "upend our campaign finance system."

Experts attribute the rapid spread to extremely dry conditions following a below-average rainy season, which has left vegetation primed to burn.

This lack of a comprehensive and transparent process has eroded public trust and led to a rise in vigilante justice.
