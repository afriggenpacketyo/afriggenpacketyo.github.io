        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Water UK, the industry body, has admitted that the current self-monitoring system for sewage pollution is damaging public trust and proposes a new, third-party monitoring system. This comes amid concerns that water companies have been misreporting pollution levels, with some cases found to be deliberate. The industry body suggests that a third party system would add more pressure to the regulators, which have also been criticised for not holding the companies to account. The UK government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's Republican congressional delegation are appealing to President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. They argue that the storms caused catastrophic damage, resulting in deaths, injuries, and widespread destruction. This request follows similar denials from FEMA to Washington and North Carolina, raising concerns about the agency's responsiveness to state needs.

He also emphasized that "America First does not mean America alone," hinting at a possible de-escalation of trade tensions. Bessent also addressed that the IMF and World Bank need to be made "fit for purpose" again.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new chief federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, Bill Essayli, intends to pursue immigration charges against Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano, the driver in a 2021 crash that killed a young couple. Ortega-Anguiano, who pleaded guilty to gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, could face up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted of illegally reentering the country after being deported twice. The case has drawn attention amid reports that Ortega-Anguiano could be released from state prison after serving a reduced sentence.</p>

          <h2>Trump Pressures Ukraine to Accept Peace Plan Favoring Russia</h2>

          <p>President Trump and his top aides are pressuring Ukraine to accept a peace proposal that would grant Russia all the territory it has gained in the war, while offering Kyiv only vague security assurances. The plan, which would also block Ukraine from joining NATO, has been rejected by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, leading to a public dispute between the two leaders. The proposal also appears to call for the United States to recognize Russia’s 2014 takeover of Crimea, a region of Ukraine.</p>
