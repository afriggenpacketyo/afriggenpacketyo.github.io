          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating a 'minerals-for-security' agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo, offering U.S. firms privileged access to Congolese mineral assets in exchange for military support. This marks a shift from the Biden administration's approach, which emphasized partnership, climate cooperation, and development, exemplified by the Lobito Corridor project. The new policy reflects a reaction to China's growing influence in Africa's mining sector and a recalibrated doctrine under the Trump administration, prioritizing strategic resource acquisition and security interests.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, reported first-quarter revenue of $90.23 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations, causing shares to rise over 5% in after-hours trading.

However, YouTube advertising revenue fell slightly short of expectations. The company's CFO noted that President Trump's decision to end the de minimis trade loophole will negatively impact their Ads business in 2025.

The ruling came amid other legal setbacks for Trump, including challenges to DEI programs in schools.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is facing scrutiny over the alleged misuse of $10 million in state funds that were directed to a political campaign. The money, initially part of a settlement paid to Florida by Centene, was transferred to a non-profit group founded by DeSantis' wife, Casey, and then to political groups campaigning against a marijuana legalization amendment. Republican lawmakers are questioning the legality of the transaction and are calling for a criminal investigation. DeSantis denies any wrongdoing and accuses the news media and Republican lawmakers of manufacturing a fraud.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 145 percent tax on goods imported from China is impacting Chinese grocery stores and their customers. The tariffs are affecting everything from sofas to socks, and especially Chinese grocery stores which are stocked with Chinese products. Shoppers are bracing for price hikes on premium goods and hyper-specific varieties, and fear that they may be priced out of reach.</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old Venezuelan man, Ricardo Prada Vásquez, was deported to El Salvador after accidentally taking a wrong turn onto the Ambassador Bridge into Canada. He was detained while re-entering the U.S. and U.S. authorities took him into custody. The Department of Homeland Security claims he was a member of a criminal organization called Tren de Aragua. Immigration rights experts are concerned about this case and others where people are being deported without due process.</p>
