          <p>China has sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, urging coordinated action against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies as trade tensions escalate. The letter from Chinese Premier Li Qiang suggests Japan join China in opposing protectionism, though Japan, a close U.S. ally, is expected to respond cautiously. This move highlights the ongoing economic tensions and the complex geopolitical landscape as nations navigate trade disputes and alliances. Japan is also focusing on strengthening ties with Southeast Asian nations, given the uncertainty surrounding the global economic and security situation sparked by U.S. policies.</p>

          <p>Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) successfully retrieved a second sample of melted fuel from the No. 2 reactor at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The extracted debris, weighing 3 grams or less, will be analyzed to determine its composition and solidity, aiding in the development of effective removal and storage methods. This is a crucial step in the decommissioning process, which aims to safely remove the estimated 880 tons of melted fuel remaining in reactors 1 to 3. The retrieval process involved inserting a specialized device into the containment vessel to grab the sample.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk plans to decrease his role in Donald Trump's administration following a significant drop in Tesla's profits and revenues. The decline is attributed to slumping sales and backlash related to Musk's increased political involvement. Musk, who contributes significantly to Trump's re-election efforts and leads the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), will reduce his time allocation to government matters. This decision comes amid concerns over Tesla's performance, which has been impacted by changing political sentiment and trade policies, including Trump's tariffs on China.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at four-year lows in March, with the consumer price index climbing 0.9% year-on-year, primarily driven by increases in food and private transport costs. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, slowed to 0.5%. This data emerges as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, where cost-of-living pressures are a key concern for voters. The Monetary Authority of Singapore recently eased its monetary policy for the second time, reflecting concerns about potential zero growth this year after a lower-than-expected GDP expansion in the first quarter.</p>

The report indicates a record-low number of teenage births and an increase in births among women aged 40-44.

          <p>Netflix's 'Stranger Things' has made its way to Broadway with 'The First Shadow,' a prequel set in 1959 Hawkins. The production combines cinematic fluidity with stage dynamism, attracting a younger audience to the theater district. However, the play's plot suffers from squeezing an entire season's worth of content into a 2-hour, 45-minute performance, resulting in narrative gaps. Despite the impressive visual effects and talented cast, the play prioritizes sensation over sense, leaving critics questioning the artistic purpose of this franchise extension.</p>

          <p>Six major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to prevent the implementation of 25% tariffs on auto parts.

The letter, addressed to key administration officials, emphasizes the potential for production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies within the industry.
