          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has advocated for an international center to foster global cooperation on artificial intelligence, aiming to counter the current fragmented regulatory landscape. This initiative comes as China seeks to expand its influence in the rapidly evolving AI sector, intensifying its technological competition with the United States. Li's proposal was made at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, days after the US released its own AI development blueprint. The move underscores China's ambition to establish a widely accepted global governance framework for AI.</p>

          <p>Hotel rooms, despite appearing clean, often harbor significant levels of bacteria and viruses in overlooked areas. Studies indicate common touchpoints like remotes, light switches, and even decorative items can be teeming with germs, with some hotel rooms exceeding hospital bacteria limits. Experts advise travelers to take precautions upon arrival, such as removing decorative pillows and runners, and sanitizing high-touch surfaces. This article highlights specific areas like bathtubs and glassware that require attention, recommending bringing personal drinkware or thoroughly rinsing hotel items.</p>

          <p>China's official military newspaper, PLA Daily, has published a three-part series urging the People's Liberation Army's political officers to restore their image and reputation. The guidelines emphasize demonstrating stronger loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, maintaining honesty in their duties, and ensuring integrity in promoting soldiers. Observers suggest these commentaries subtly allude to misdeeds by fallen generals, indicating Beijing's expectation for political officials to address and repair damage to the force's standing. The initiative underscores a drive to prevent personal interests from undermining collective good and party oaths.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland this weekend, aiming to forge a framework trade agreement before a 30% tariff on EU imports takes effect. This high-stakes meeting comes amidst growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a 15% tariff as a potential compromise. The U.S. and EU share the world's largest bilateral trade relationship, and avoiding a trade war is crucial given their significant global economic impact. The discussions follow a similar U.S.-Japan trade deal, setting a precedent for potential outcomes.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted accomplice of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was questioned for a day and a half by the U.S. Justice Department regarding the Epstein case. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking, reportedly answered questions honestly about "100 different people," though no clemency offers were made for her cooperation. The questioning comes amidst renewed public attention to Epstein's associates, including former President Donald Trump, who denies knowledge of his name appearing in Epstein's files and is suing a newspaper for defamation. Maxwell's lawyer maintains her innocence and plans to appeal her conviction.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Tunisians marched in the capital to protest President Kais Saied's increasingly authoritarian rule, marking four years since his controversial power grab. Demonstrators demanded the release of jailed opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, criticizing the country's transformation into an "open-air prison." Since dissolving parliament and ruling by decree in 2021, Saied has dismantled judicial bodies and imprisoned numerous opponents, leading critics to label his actions as a coup. Protesters emphasized the need to restore democracy and free political detainees, asserting that Republic Day now symbolizes the "dismantling" of Tunisia.</p>

          <h2>Over 20% of NASA's Workforce Seeks to Leave Agency Amid Buyout Program and Budget Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 22:49:49 EDT</div>

          <p>Over 20% of NASA's workforce, nearly 4,000 employees, have applied to leave the agency through the Trump administration's deferred resignation program. This significant reduction, coupled with approximately 500 employees lost through normal attrition, would shrink NASA's civil servant workforce from 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. The buyout program was introduced across the federal government to cut costs and reduce workforce size, coinciding with a proposed 25% budget cut for NASA in fiscal year 2026. The agency affirmed safety remains a top priority amidst efforts to streamline operations and pursue ambitious exploration goals.</p>

          <h2>JD Vance Criticizes Microsoft Over American Layoffs and H-1B Visa Reliance</h2>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has publicly criticized Microsoft and other tech companies for laying off thousands of American workers while simultaneously increasing their reliance on immigrant labor through the H-1B visa program. Vance questioned the ethical and economic justification of these practices, calling the claim that companies cannot find workers in America a "bullshit story." Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged the recent job eliminations, stating these decisions weigh heavily on him. The company's second round of downsizing in 2025 affected less than 4% of its workforce, totaling over 15,000 layoffs this year.</p>
