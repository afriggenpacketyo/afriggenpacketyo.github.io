          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's ongoing refusal to accept a ceasefire is a major complication in peace negotiations. This comes after a summit where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region in exchange for an end to hostilities. Zelenskyy emphasized that no meaningful peace talks can occur until the fighting stops, a position he will reinforce during his upcoming meeting at the White House with U.S. and European leaders. He also warned that Russia might intensify its military pressure to gain leverage in the ongoing diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey has gained a significant following by blending modern pop sensibilities with classical and jazz influences, creating a whimsical and romantic sound. The 26-year-old artist, who recently won a Grammy Award, attributes her unique musical style to her childhood exposure to both classical violin from her mother and jazz from her father. In a recent interview, she reflected on her journey from feeling like an outsider in her youth to selling out concerts and collaborating with legends like Barbra Streisand. Her third album, "A Matter of Time," continues to explore this distinctive fusion of genres.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity, though it remains a powerful hurricane as it tracks north of the Caribbean. The storm's outer bands are bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, prompting flash flood warnings. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, its large size is generating dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast. Forecasters anticipate Erin will continue to turn northward into the Atlantic, but its path will bring it between Bermuda and the U.S.</p>

          <p>Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly set to be left out of the squad for the upcoming Premier League match against Arsenal. The decision, made by coach Ruben Amorim, comes amidst intense speculation about the 22-year-old's future with the club. Hojlund's playing time is expected to be significantly reduced following the recent high-profile signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. AC Milan is among the clubs expressing interest in the Danish striker, though no formal agreement has been reached for his transfer from Old Trafford.</p>

He argued that a successful outcome would be securing a ceasefire, which would then allow for more complex negotiations involving Ukraine and European allies. Sullivan defended holding the meeting on American soil, stating that Alaska's significant military presence projects the strength necessary when dealing with Vladimir Putin. He also emphasized Alaska's strategic importance in the Arctic and discussed his efforts to advance local energy projects like the Alaska LNG Project.</p>

The three deceased victims were all men, pronounced dead at the scene, while the wounded were transported to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities have recovered one weapon near the lounge but have not yet identified or apprehended any suspects in the attack, which occurred at a venue with a prior history of a non-fatal shooting.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to support the Trump administration's federalization of the city's police force. This move is part of a broader effort to address what the administration has declared an emergency regarding crime and public order in the nation's capital. The deployment adds to the roughly 800 D.C. National Guard members already activated, tightening federal control over the city's law enforcement. While the White House stated the troops may be armed, they will not be making arrests, instead providing support to other law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the recent summit in Alaska was a strategic victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who returned without making any concessions on a ceasefire in Ukraine. The analysis suggests that the U.S. president's eagerness for a deal allowed Putin to frame the narrative, insisting that a comprehensive peace agreement must precede any halt in fighting. By getting the U.S. to entertain a land-for-peace proposal involving the Donbas region, Putin has increased pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and sowed further mistrust between Washington and its European allies, all while facing no immediate threat of new sanctions.</p>

          <p>Just weeks before the federal government assumed control of Washington D.C.'s police force, the department was accused of altering crime statistics to present a more favorable picture. The D.C. Police Union chairman alleged that senior officers would direct members to downgrade felony offenses to lesser charges in official reports. These accusations surfaced around the same time a police commander was suspended for allegedly falsifying crime data, an investigation that is still ongoing. The allegations have provided fuel for the administration's justification of the federalization, which critics have argued is based on a misleading narrative about the city's crime rates.</p>

          <h2>German Coalition Government Divided Over Reinstating Compulsory Military Service</h2>

          <p>Germany's coalition government is at odds over how to expand the country's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO commitments. The center-right CDU/CSU parties favor reinstating some form of compulsory military service, which was suspended in 2011. However, their center-left SPD partners strongly oppose compulsion, instead proposing a more attractive voluntary service model. A draft bill by the SPD Defense Minister includes mandatory online questionnaires and medical check-ups for all 18-year-old men, but critics argue this is insufficient to guarantee the needed personnel increase in the current security climate.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced climber, was rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when the extreme force of the water pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, search teams used a drone to locate him, finding him alive and conscious. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew then performed a hoist rescue, lifting him to safety where he was treated for dehydration and minor injuries.</p>

          <p>Amid rising concerns over the affordability of higher education, a report highlights nine U.S. schools that charge no tuition for admitted students. These institutions, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have highly selective admissions standards. In exchange for a free education, which often includes room and board, students are usually required to participate in comprehensive work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation. The article presents these schools as a potential solution for families seeking to avoid significant student loan debt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the three years since ChatGPT's launch, generative AI has become an indispensable tool for college students, fundamentally changing the nature of higher education. Surveys show a vast majority of undergraduates now use AI for tasks ranging from summarizing readings to completing entire assignments, driven by academic pressure and the desire for efficiency. This rapid adoption has left many professors struggling to adapt, with some reverting to in-class, handwritten assignments to ensure academic integrity. The article suggests that this technological shift demands a deeper redesign of classroom practices to focus on skills that AI cannot easily replicate, such as critical discussion and project-based learning.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's decision to end race-based affirmative action, the White House is now requiring universities to submit detailed admissions data to check for compliance. Richard Kahlenberg, an expert who testified against race-based preferences, now expresses concern that the administration may also target class-based affirmative action programs. He argues that giving a leg up to economically disadvantaged students is a legal and effective way to achieve both racial and economic diversity. Kahlenberg fears that because these programs benefit minority students, they could be misconstrued as illegal racial proxies, despite also benefiting the working-class base of the Republican party.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster implemented a series of "brotherhood meetings" during training camp to help bond a team with 55 new players and a largely new coaching staff. In these sessions, coaches and players shared personal and vulnerable stories about their lives and careers, leading to what Foster described as many emotional moments. The goal was to build trust and unity by encouraging players to lower their guards after seeing the coaching staff do the same. This focus on connection has resulted in a new team motto for the upcoming season: "We over me."</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats in the 11 days since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" returns agreement. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a strong asylum case. However, with removals to France yet to begin, the crossings have continued, bringing the total for the year to approximately 28,000. Aid workers have expressed concern that smugglers are now overcrowding larger boats, increasing the danger for those attempting the journey.</p>

Her comments came ahead of a virtual meeting of the "Coalition of the Willing," a group of nations supporting Kyiv, and before Zelenskyy's planned peace talks in Washington, which several European leaders will attend to ensure a united front.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Chinese universities are facing intense online criticism for hosting events with Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. The controversy stems from social media users highlighting Longarino's past posts on X that were critical of Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region. Central South University in Hunan, which invited him to lecture on sexual harassment cases, has been a primary target of the backlash. In response to the online pressure, at least three universities have removed announcements and posts related to Longarino's events from their websites, though the pages are still visible in search engine results.</p>
