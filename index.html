          <p>The Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by allegedly fostering a 'hostile environment' for Jewish students since the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights alleges that Columbia failed to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination, violating Title VI. The government claims the university failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism and did not properly investigate or punish vandalism targeting Jewish students. Columbia University has not yet publicly responded to these claims, which could jeopardize its federal funding.</p>

          <p>A senior Ukrainian official announced that a major prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine is currently underway, despite President Donald Trump initially declaring the swap complete. This development follows direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Turkey, where an agreement was reached to release approximately 1,000 prisoners of war. President Trump has expressed optimism that this exchange could lead to broader peace negotiations, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the agreement to release 1,000 Ukrainians from Russian captivity.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a 5% tax on remittance transfers from the U.S., targeting the approximately $160 billion sent annually by Latin Americans, a move intended to curb illegal migration. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized the plan, arguing it amounts to double taxation. Experts warn the tax could push transfers into informal channels and severely impact countries heavily reliant on remittances, such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras, where they constitute a significant portion of GDP. The policy is also raising concerns among Latino voters in the U.S., potentially affecting Republican support in future elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it would revoke Harvard University's eligibility to enroll international students, escalating its conflict with the institution. This move could force over 6,000 students to transfer or lose their legal status, prompting concerns among U.S. universities already facing funding cuts. Education advocates criticized the decision as damaging to U.S. higher education, noting the significant financial and intellectual contributions of international students. Harvard is likely to challenge the decision in court, but the situation creates uncertainty for students and highlights the administration's willingness to exert control over universities.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed that the energy price cap will fall in July, leading to a decrease of Â£11 a month for typical gas and electricity bills. However, Ofgem is urging households to shop around for cheaper fixed-rate deals, which could potentially save up to Â£200 annually. This price drop, the first in a year, reflects a decrease in international wholesale gas prices, but energy bills remain high. Citizens Advice has cautioned that the price cap reduction provides 'cold comfort' to those struggling with energy debt, advocating for targeted support and energy efficiency measures.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread protests and calls for police reform following the murder of George Floyd five years ago, surprisingly little has changed nationwide. States and cities enacted new policies, but data indicates minimal impact on accountability or police killings. Killings by police officers have risen since 2019, and prosecutions for police shootings remain largely unchanged. Experts attribute this to lawmakers rejecting proposed changes and the reforms not going far enough to transform policing. Additionally, a rise in the murder rate has shifted public sentiment, diminishing focus on reform.</p>

Judge Susan Illston stated that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force without congressional approval. The lawsuit, brought by labor unions and local governments, argued that Trump lacked the authority to make such changes unilaterally. The order prevents agencies from issuing new reorganization plans and layoff notices, though it does not require them to rehire those already laid off.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offers as above inflation, but the BMA argues that doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago.

          <p>A Florida court has ordered Genaro Garcia Luna, a former Mexican security chief convicted of drug trafficking, and his wife to pay over $2.4 billion to Mexico. Garcia Luna, nicknamed 'supercop,' was found guilty in a U.S. court of accepting bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel to facilitate drug smuggling. The ruling follows a lawsuit filed by Mexico alleging corruption and money laundering involving public contracts. The awarded amount is three times what the Mexican government initially sought, with Garcia Luna ordered to pay nearly $749 million and his wife $1.74 billion.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have passed a sweeping legislative package that disproportionately benefits wealthy Americans while potentially harming low-income households through cuts to social safety net programs. A key component of the bill is a national school voucher program that would use federal tax credits to incentivize donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations, which would then provide scholarships for private school tuition. Critics argue that this plan would primarily benefit wealthy families already in private schools and could lead to increased tuition costs, while also diverting resources from public schools and potentially discriminating against students with disabilities.</p>
