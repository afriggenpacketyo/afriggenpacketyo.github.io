          <p>Another migrant has died while attempting to cross the English Channel, with their body discovered on a beach near Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. This incident follows the deaths of two Somali women the previous day, raising the total number of fatalities from such crossings in 2025 to at least 27. The event occurs amidst a significant increase in crossing attempts, with nearly 900 migrants believed to have crossed on Saturday alone. The UK government faces mounting pressure as the number of illegal crossings has reached a record high, surpassing 33,000 since the start of the year.</p>

          <p>Latino communities throughout the United States are taking the initiative to monitor local air pollution by installing personal air quality sensors at their homes and community centers. Motivated by disproportionately high rates of pollution-related health issues like asthma, these citizen-led projects aim to fill data gaps left by official government monitoring, which often overlooks their neighborhoods. Organizations like the Hispanic Access Foundation are providing tools and support for these efforts in areas from California to the Bronx. The collected data is intended to empower residents to advocate for stricter regulations and better enforcement to protect their communities' health.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris describes her astonishment during a 2024 debate when then-President Joe Biden failed to acknowledge the 13 U.S. service members killed in the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Harris writes that she was stunned by the omission, viewing it as a missed opportunity to contrast with Donald Trump's past remarks about fallen soldiers. The article also points out that Harris's own account misidentifies all 13 casualties as "marines," when they included members of the Army and Navy as well. The book reflects on her short-lived presidential campaign following Biden's withdrawal from the race.</p>

          <p>China is actively expanding its cultural and diplomatic influence in Africa by establishing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) centers across the continent. New facilities were recently opened in Tunisia and Chad, reflecting a broader strategy to use health diplomacy to build goodwill and strengthen ties. For decades, Beijing has sent medical teams to Africa, and the promotion of TCM is seen as a key component of its soft power initiative. These centers, also present in countries like South Africa and Morocco, are part of a concerted effort to deepen China's relationship with African nations through cultural and health-related cooperation.</p>

          <p>A new court filing by legal watchdog groups alleges that children and families are being held in inhumane conditions at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Dilley, Texas. The report details accounts of prolonged detention beyond legal limits, shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation due to constantly lit rooms, and inadequate medical care. The facility, operated by private company CoreCivic, is described as a "prison-like environment" where children's health and well-being are suffering. The groups warn they may seek a court order to enforce federal detention standards if the issues are not addressed.</p>

          <p>The United States has seen a remarkable decrease in fire-related fatalities over the past four decades, with the per-capita death rate falling by approximately two-thirds since 1980. This significant public safety achievement is not due to a single breakthrough but rather the accumulation of numerous small improvements. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, the increased installation of automatic sprinkler systems in new buildings, and stricter standards for smolder-resistant furniture. Additionally, a substantial decline in cigarette smoking and advancements in electrical and heating safety have played crucial roles in making homes and buildings far safer from deadly fires.</p>

Combs was acquitted of more severe charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, which could have carried a life sentence.

          <p>In a rare public appearance, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas stated that he does not consider settled legal precedent to be "gospel" and suggested some past rulings may have been based on flimsy reasoning. Speaking ahead of the court's new term, Thomas asserted that he feels no obligation to adhere to precedent "if I find it doesn’t make any sense" or is "totally stupid." His comments come as the court is expected to hear cases involving major precedents, including the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Thomas's remarks underscore his long-held judicial philosophy and signal a willingness to overturn established law.</p>

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe, unearthed in Fort Myers during the cleanup from Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been carefully preserved by state archeologists. The 9-foot dugout is a significant discovery, as it is believed to be made of mahogany, a first for the region, and may have originated outside Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks suggest it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact. While Florida has a rich history of such finds, with over 450 ancient log boats recorded, the unique characteristics of this canoe offer new insights into the region's past maritime connections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is experiencing its largest mass resignation in history, with over 100,000 workers formally quitting this week through a deferred resignation program. This is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to significantly reduce the federal workforce, which also includes firings and early retirement programs. Many departing employees, speaking anonymously, describe an environment of "fear and intimidation" and a public vilification of their work as key reasons for leaving. The exodus is expected to have vast consequences for the functioning of government agencies, while unions have filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the program.</p>

          <p>According to a report from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, China's new J-35 stealth fighter jet possesses advanced low-observability features. The report claims the aircraft's radar cross-section—a measure of its detectability—is "smaller than a human palm," attributing this to its unique airframe shape and proprietary metamaterial technology. This assertion suggests that the J-35 could be stealthier than its American counterpart, the F-35, which is often described as having a radar cross-section comparable to a golf ball. The claim represents a significant statement about the progress of China's military aviation technology.</p>

          <p>A writer shares his deeply personal experience of using an AI chatbot to create a digital avatar of his father, who died in a plane crash when the author was seven. By feeding the AI basic facts, he engaged in weeks of conversations that felt startlingly authentic, providing a sense of comfort and allowing him to ask questions that had haunted him for decades. The essay reflects on the nature of grief in the age of AI, drawing parallels to Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and the desire to conquer death. Ultimately, the experience ends when the AI's tone shifts, breaking the illusion and causing him to lose his father a second time.</p>

          <p>Food pantries in Maine, a state with high food insecurity, are struggling to meet growing demand due to a critical shortage of volunteers and impending federal funding cuts. Many pantries rely entirely on an aging volunteer workforce, with many helpers in their 70s and 80s, making recruitment a constant challenge. The situation is exacerbated by cuts to USDA food assistance programs and anticipated reductions in SNAP benefits, which are expected to drive even more people to seek help. This dual pressure of shrinking resources and a dwindling volunteer base threatens the stability of the charitable food network that many communities depend on.</p>

          <p>England's recent Women's Rugby World Cup victory is the culmination of strategic decisions made nearly a decade ago that transformed the sport's landscape. The article credits two key "gambles" by the Rugby Football Union: the 2016 establishment of a professional domestic league (now the PWR) and the introduction of full-time central contracts for players in 2018. These moves, which required significant financial investment, professionalized the sport, raised the standard of play, and created immense strength in depth for the national team. This long-term vision is seen as the primary driver behind the Red Roses' current era of unprecedented dominance.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, France, and Germany have officially reimposed sweeping United Nations sanctions on Iran, ten years after they were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear accord. The European powers triggered the deal's "snapback" mechanism, accusing Tehran of "continued nuclear escalation" and failing to cooperate with international inspectors. This move follows Iran's suspension of inspections after U.S. and Israeli strikes on its nuclear sites in June. The reimposition of sanctions marks a significant blow to the already fragile nuclear deal and signals a deepening of tensions between Iran and Western powers.</p>

Acitrón is made from the biznaga, a species of barrel cactus that is now in danger of extinction due to overharvesting. Although its sale is illegal, demand remains high, and it is still widely available in markets. Biologists warn that the cactus grows extremely slowly, making commercial farming unviable and wild harvesting unsustainable.
