          <p>Design software company Figma experienced a 13% drop in its stock price during extended trading after releasing its first earnings report since its initial public offering. Although the company's revenue of $249.6 million met expectations and showed a 41% year-over-year increase, its third-quarter forecast suggested a potential slowdown in growth. CEO Dylan Field addressed concerns about AI's impact on the design industry, asserting that the need for human creativity will become even more critical. The company also reported a net retention rate of 129%, reflecting strong expansion with its existing customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, which the White House claims killed 11 drug traffickers, has drawn significant scrutiny from legal experts. Multiple specialists in international and maritime law told BBC Verify that the action may have violated conventions on the use of force in international waters and human rights law. The experts argue that labeling the individuals as "narco-terrorists" does not automatically make them lawful military targets outside of an armed conflict, potentially classifying the killings as extrajudicial. The Trump administration has defended the strike as necessary to prevent drugs from reaching the U.S.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is facing backlash from conservatives for comments made at a Labor Day picnic that appeared to reference online rumors about President Donald Trump's health. Walz remarked that people have been waking up "thinking there might be news," which critics interpreted as him wishing for news of the president's death. The comments were labeled as "vile" and a "new low" by political opponents, who highlighted that Trump has recently faced two assassination attempts. This incident is part of a pattern of Walz's increasingly sharp rhetoric against the president in recent months.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident occurred in Lisbon, Portugal, when a historic funicular streetcar, known as the Elevador da Glória, derailed and crashed. The incident resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people and left another 18 injured, with five reported to be in serious condition. Preliminary information suggests a safety cable on the electric streetcar may have broken, causing it to lose control on a steep hill. In response to the significant loss of life, the mayor of Lisbon has declared a three-day period of mourning for the city.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to cancel $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs concluded that the administration used allegations of antisemitism on campus as a "smokescreen" to target the university for political reasons. While the judge's order restores the funding, she also noted in her decision that Harvard has been "plagued by antisemitism" and should have addressed the issue more effectively.

          <p>Governor Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced that Florida will work to become the first state to eliminate all childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance. The move, which also includes creating a state-level "Make America Healthy Again" commission, aims to give parents more control over their children's health decisions. This decision has drawn immediate criticism from physician groups, who emphasize that vaccines are a safe and effective method for preventing the spread of communicable diseases like polio and measles. The state's plan will require a combination of administrative rule changes and new legislation to be passed.</p>

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office has announced that no criminal charges will be filed against four Pocatello police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism. The decision was based on the conclusion that prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were not justified in using deadly force. According to the report, officers were responding to a 911 call about a male with a knife and were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities. The family's attorney expressed disappointment but not surprise at the outcome and plans to proceed with a wrongful death lawsuit.</p>

The case dates back to a 2007 house fire, after which Todd Stermer, who had escaped the blaze with severe burns, was run over by a van driven by his wife. Prosecutors argued that she intentionally set the fire and then struck him with the vehicle, a view supported by her sons. Linda Stermer has maintained her innocence, claiming the fire was an accident and that she ran over her husband unknowingly while trying to get help. Her first conviction was overturned in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel.</p>

Concerns over security, economic strain, and the rise of far-right parties have led many governments, including those in Sweden and Hungary, to implement tougher border controls and asylum laws. This trend marks a significant departure from the more welcoming stance initially articulated by leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel.

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on Guangzhou Tengyue Chemical, a company based in China, for its alleged involvement in manufacturing and shipping fentanyl precursor chemicals and other illicit opioids into the U.S. The Treasury Department's action targets the company and two of its representatives, accusing them of pushing "poison for profit." This move is part of a broader U.S. effort to combat the fentanyl crisis, which the State Department claims China plays a central role in by failing to control the source of these deadly substances. Overdoses from synthetic opioids are currently the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.</p>

          <p>Two Republican members of the Senate Banking Committee, Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis, have stated they will not consider a potential replacement for Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook until her lawsuit is resolved. Cook is suing President Trump over his attempt to fire her from the independent central bank, a move she claims is unlawful. The senators' stance is significant because their support would be crucial for advancing any new nominee through the committee, where Republicans hold a slim majority. They emphasized the need for due process and expressed concern that the move to oust Cook could be a partisan effort to politicize the Fed.</p>

The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.91 per share on $10.24 billion in revenue, exceeding analyst expectations. However, its guidance for the upcoming third quarter fell slightly short of consensus estimates, signaling continued modest growth. Salesforce has struggled to match the AI-driven stock market boom seen by its tech peers, with its shares down 23% for the year prior to the earnings announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

Earlier, on Truth Social, Trump offered congratulations to President Xi while also accusing him of conspiring against the United States with Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window saw clubs spend a record £3 billion, highlighting a growing financial disparity with other European leagues and within English football itself. While the spending reflects the league's immense media revenue, some experts express concern that financial regulations, like the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), are creating a "glass ceiling." These rules may inadvertently force aspirational clubs to sell homegrown talent to larger, wealthier teams, polarizing the league. This trend has led to calls for modifying the rules to foster better competitive balance and allow clubs to retain their academy-developed players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have gained new insights into a bizarre, heavily armored dinosaur named Spicomellus that lived over 165 million years ago in what is now Morocco. Recently unearthed remains reveal that the car-sized herbivore possessed an elaborate defense system, including three-foot-long neck spikes and ribs with spikes fused directly to the bone, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting their armor was more complex and developed earlier than previously thought. Scientists believe the elaborate spikes served a dual purpose for both defense against predators and attracting mates.</p>
