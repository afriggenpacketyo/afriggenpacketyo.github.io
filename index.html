        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, have jointly accused Israel of "weaponizing aid" in Gaza, leading to deepening starvation. They report increased denials for aid delivery under new, stricter Israeli regulations, which ban groups deemed to "delegitimize" the state or refuse to provide detailed information about Palestinian staff. Israel denies these claims, asserting that the rules, introduced in March, ensure aid reaches the population directly and not Hamas. However, humanitarian groups counter that most major international NGOs have been unable to deliver significant supplies since March, leaving hospitals without basic necessities and vulnerable populations dying from hunger and preventable illnesses.</p>

          <p>Singapore, known for financial prudence, is experiencing a significant rise in residents living paycheck to paycheck, with 60% of workers affected in 2024. This trend, higher than regional peers, is driven by the country's escalating cost of living, including expensive housing and import reliance, outpacing income growth. Experts note a cultural shift where younger generations prioritize experiences over traditional long-term savings, sometimes spending beyond their means through mechanisms like "buy now, pay later" plans. This article underscores the struggle for middle-income earners to save despite high incomes, reflecting deeper societal changes.</p>

This landmark transaction surpasses previous records for sports franchises, reflecting the growing valuations in professional sports. The article notes the Celtics' storied history, including their record 18 NBA championships, with titles in 2008 and 2024 under the previous ownership.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has concluded a six-year legal battle, ruling that Pinkfong's global hit "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize a US composer's work. The court upheld lower court verdicts, determining that composer Jonathan Wright's 2011 version, based on a public domain folk song, lacked "substantial alteration" to be protected by copyright. Pinkfong's 2016 adaptation, known for its viral YouTube video and "doo doo doo doo doo doo" refrain, became the most-viewed video on the platform. This article highlights the song's phenomenal success and its origins in 1970s US summer camps.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has directed state police to launch a criminal investigation into serious allegations that staff at Centreville High School in Fairfax County arranged and potentially bankrolled abortions for minor students in 2021 without parental consent. Reports suggest school administrators may have been aware of these actions, and public funds, including local, state, and federal, might have been misused. Fairfax County Public Schools stated they have initiated an external investigation into the "unacceptable" allegations, emphasizing a commitment to uncovering the facts. This article highlights the governor's deep concern and the condemnation from pro-life groups who label it "state-funded child exploitation."</p>
