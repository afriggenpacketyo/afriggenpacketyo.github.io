        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports that Romania's ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship played a crucial role in the election of Nicusor Dan as president, voting in large numbers to support his pro-European stance. These voters, estimated to be between 500,000 and 700,000, rejected the hard-right candidate George Simion, who had anti-minority views and was backed by Hungarian PM Viktor Orban. The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) also opposed Orban's recommendation to vote for Simion, marking a shift in their relationship. Dan's victory is seen as a win for liberal democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic path, highlighting the importance of minority groups in shaping political outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prince Harry's appeal against the UK government's decision to remove his police protection has failed, with little chance of further legal recourse. The article explains that the courts ruled Harry misunderstood how the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) operates, particularly concerning his decision to step back from royal duties and live abroad. Ravec's role is to oversee security for key public figures within the UK, funded by the Home Office, and it deemed providing security for Harry as a private citizen living abroad outside its remit. The prince's argument that his birthright and the associated risks warranted state protection was ultimately rejected by the courts.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial has seen testimonies from Cassie Ventura, male escorts, ex-assistants, and former Homeland Security Investigations agents. Experts are divided on whether the prosecution is meeting its burden of proving Diddy helmed a criminal enterprise used to sexually exploit women. The defense is using cross-examination to support their theory that while Diddy may be a â€˜bad actorâ€™ when it comes to domestic violence, the federal charges are unsubstantiated. Witnesses testified about violence, control, and 'freak offs,' but reasonable doubt remains about whether these constitute a criminal enterprise or a pattern of criminal conduct.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has obtained a court order to prevent waste vehicles from being blocked from leaving depots due to ongoing strike action by refuse workers. The authority estimates that over 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste have accumulated on streets this week. The strike, which began in March, is centered on proposed cuts to bin lorry drivers' pay. Unite, the union representing the workers, has blamed government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress in negotiations and demands the council address the pay cuts.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson committing to publishing it later in the year. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures, including scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children. Critics have condemned the delay, while charities offer mixed reactions, with some emphasizing the need for a comprehensive strategy. The government maintains its commitment to tackling child poverty through various existing measures.</p>

          <p>Holger MÃ¼nch, head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), has warned that some young people are forming groups to commit serious crimes after being radicalized by far-right ideologies. This follows a recent police crackdown on a far-right extremist cell with members as young as 14. The announcement comes as train services at Hamburg's main station return to normal after a knife attack by a female suspect injured 18 people on Friday, though police do not believe the suspect acted with a political motive.</p>

          <p>More and more Japanese people, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting" their jobs, opting for a better work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, these workers prioritize personal time and are less willing to sacrifice their lives for the company. This shift is attributed to factors such as the desire for more "me time," disillusionment with traditional corporate loyalty, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts view this trend as a positive change, potentially leading to happier individuals and a more balanced society.</p>

          <p>Israeli soldiers and Palestinian detainees have told the AP that the Israeli military is systematically using Palestinians as human shields in Gaza, despite it being prohibited by international law. They claim that Palestinians are forced into buildings and tunnels to check for explosives or militants. The Israeli military denies these allegations, stating it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields and is investigating alleged cases. Rights groups and some soldiers claim that the practice is known and tolerated by commanders, and has become widespread during the conflict.</p>

          <p>The article discusses Germany's selective approach to acknowledging its Nazi past, highlighting the awarding of the Herbert Quandt Media Prize, which celebrates the legacy of an early SS supporter who played a central role in the Nazi war economy. It criticizes the German media organizations for accepting the prize, thereby whitewashing the legacy of a figure who oversaw slave labor and worked with former Nazi propagandists. The author argues that this selective remembrance, along with the continued honoring of colonial administrators and the refusal to pay reparations to victims of genocide, reveals a broader German refusal to confront the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide.</p>
