          <p>Thursday's UK newspapers feature a range of stories, including the government's plans to address prison overcrowding, which the Daily Mail criticizes as being soft on criminals. The Times highlights concerns that early release of sexual offenders will endanger the public. The Guardian leads with accusations that Science Secretary Peter Kyle is too closely aligned with US big tech firms, while the Financial Times reports on stalled Brexit talks due to disagreements over fishing rights and youth mobility. The i paper suggests that a deal on food safety standards with the EU could lower food prices, and the Daily Telegraph reports on the NHS treating nursery-age children who identify as transgender.</p>

          <p>US lawmakers are contemplating restructuring the State Department to better align economic and foreign policy objectives, as major economies begin to circumvent the United States due to Washington's departure from established global trading rules. During a House subcommittee hearing, witnesses and lawmakers generally agreed that closer economic engagement with trading partners is essential, particularly to counter China's growing influence. California Republican Young Kim, who chairs the committee, stated that the goal is to craft legislation that addresses concerns about the current alignment of agencies leading economic statecraft efforts, emphasizing the need for structural reform.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction on its fifth terminal, expected to be operational by the mid-2030s, as Asia prepares for a travel boom. The new terminal will nearly double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers annually. This expansion is part of a broader trend in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions, where airports are undergoing extensive development with combined investments of $240 billion. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted that with Terminal 5, Changi aims to connect with 200 cities, further boosting the nation's aviation ecosystem, which contributes 5% of Singapore's GDP.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A manuscript once dismissed as an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta is now believed to be a genuine version, potentially worth millions, according to UK academics. Harvard Law School acquired the document for just $27.50 in 1946, and it remained largely unnoticed in its library for decades. Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent have concluded that it is an extraordinarily rare and lost original Magna Carta from 1300, issued during the reign of King Edward I. The article notes that there are only 25 surviving originals from the various editions between 1215 and 1300, with most residing in the UK.</p>

It suggests that successful entries often feature themes of personal liberation, are primarily sung in English, allude to folk music, and incorporate elaborate staging with pyrotechnics. However, the article cautions against dramatic key changes and novelty acts, noting that these elements are no longer as effective as they once were.

          <p>During Karen Read's murder trial, a forensic scientist from the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab testified that evidence collected in red Solo cups was never tested in connection with the death of John O'Keefe. Maureen Hartnett stated that while she found broken glass, scratches, and a dent on Read's SUV, as well as blood and debris from O'Keefe's clothes, the evidence from the cups was never analyzed, so she could not confirm it was blood. A retired NYPD investigator suggested that testing the evidence, even without a clear chain of custody, could contextualize the case. Read is charged with second-degree murder, drunk driving manslaughter, and fleeing a deadly accident, charges to which she has pleaded not guilty.</p>

The law, set to fully take effect in December, seeks to promote competition from smaller firms and address the dominance of the tech giants. It will also prohibit the companies from using data obtained from the operation of their app stores or operating systems in their own products or services.

          <p>The House is moving forward on President Trump's "one, big beautiful bill," with three committees voting to advance contentious parts of the budget package aimed at addressing his defense, energy, and tax priorities. Despite progress, Republicans remain divided on key issues like Medicaid and tax cuts. The Ways and Means panel advanced its tax proposals after an 18-hour markup, but the state and local tax deduction cap remains a sticking point. The Energy and Commerce Committee advanced its portion after a 25-hour debate, focusing on Medicaid cuts and work requirements. The Agriculture Committee passed its part, increasing the age requirement for food stamp eligibility.</p>

The protest occurred during a speech by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during which protestors shouted about Gaza and Kennedy's views on vaccines. Cohen accused the US government of contributing to the deaths of children in Gaza by funding bombs and cutting Medicaid. The incident occurred shortly after Cohen attended a pro-Palestine event with Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib.</p>

The company's net loss widened to $314.6 million, partly due to stock-based compensation costs tied to the IPO. CoreWeave secured a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion, in addition to OpenAI's existing reliance on Microsoft.

          <p>A new study suggests that Venus may be more similar to Earth than previously thought, with ongoing tectonic-like processes deforming its surface and recycling its crust. The large, round features on Venus's surface called coronae may hold the key to understanding the planet's interior processes. Researchers compared models of coronae formation against gravity and topography observations from NASA's Magellan probe, finding that 52 of the coronae cap hot, buoyant plumes of molten material. This suggests that processes similar to subduction and lithospheric dripping on Earth may be occurring on Venus.</p>
