          <p>The Japanese government plans to spread soil from near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on government grounds, including the prime minister's office, to demonstrate its safety. This initiative aims to reassure the public that the soil, which has low-level radioactivity, is suitable for public works projects across Japan. The soil was collected following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused the nuclear accident, and this marks the first time it will be repurposed outside Fukushima Prefecture. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of securing public understanding, though previous attempts to reuse the soil have faced local opposition.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee has warned against attempts to pressure authorities regarding tax investigations, stating that no one is exempt from tax obligations. This statement follows recent tax reviews on members of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, where at least 20 members were asked to prepay about HK$1 million. Lee emphasized the legal obligation of the Inland Revenue Department to conduct tax audits and assessments, regardless of profession, and highlighted that tax evasion could lead to a three-year jail sentence.

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers are experiencing a second day of decline due to concerns about a potential price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's shares fell significantly after announcing price cuts on numerous electric and plug-in hybrid models. Simultaneously, China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers to address the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets, which then leads to zero-mileage cars being sold on the secondhand market. Analysts anticipate pressure on BYD's vehicle margin in the short term due to these price cuts, despite expectations of offsetting the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs.

          <p>A battle is brewing in the historic village of Maids Moreton, England, over a plan to build 153 new homes despite the local sewage works already being over capacity. Residents fear that connecting the new homes will increase sewage pollution in the nearby River Great Ouse. The Environment Agency previously objected to new developments in Oxford due to similar sewage concerns, leading to developers labeling the city as "uninvestable." An environmental charity has been granted permission for a judicial review, challenging the council's decision and highlighting the gap between housing plans and sewage infrastructure capacity.</p>

The officer questioned whether the arrest was in Packer's best interest, raising concerns about the criminalization of abortions. Despite the Crown Prosecution Service's initial decision not to prosecute, Packer was charged in 2023 after police requested a review of the case, and she was later acquitted.</p>

The MTR Corporation, which is nearly 75% government-owned, was fined HK$19.2 million, equivalent to a day of half-price fares for passengers.

          <p>A campaign called #TakingThePIP has been launched by deaf, disabled, and neurodivergent public figures in response to proposed cuts to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and the health element of Universal Credit in the UK. Advocates fear that tightening eligibility criteria will severely impact disabled individuals, potentially leading to homelessness and loss of essential support for daily living. The cuts could leave households with up to 58% less income, exacerbating poverty among those already struggling with extra costs due to disability. Concerns are raised about the inadequacy of existing support schemes, such as Access to Work, which already has long waiting lists and may face further cuts.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by Chinese group Geely Holding, will cut approximately 3,000 white-collar jobs as part of its cost-cutting measures, mainly impacting office-based positions in Sweden. The company cites challenges in the global motor industry, including tariffs, higher material costs, and slower sales in Europe. Volvo's CEO, HÃ¥kan Samuelsson, acknowledged the difficult decisions but emphasized the importance of building a stronger and more resilient company. This announcement follows a previous scaling back of Volvo's ambition to go fully electric by 2030 due to various issues, including new EV tariffs.</p>
