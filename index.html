          <p>Russia and its ally Belarus have initiated their joint quadrennial military exercises, known as "Zapad 2025," raising concerns among neighboring NATO countries. The drills, which simulate repelling enemy attacks and include nuclear-capable missile rehearsals, are taking place in Belarus and western Russia. This year's exercises are particularly tense, occurring after a Russian drone recently violated Polish airspace and amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. NATO members are on high alert, with Poland closing its border and launching its own counter-exercises.</p>

Despite reporting significant losses in the previous year, the strong market debut reflects investor interest in regulated crypto platforms.

The attack, described as a targeted political assassination, occurred during an outdoor debate event.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers stated that the offer lacked a sufficient signing bonus and adequate 401(k) benefit increases. In response to the ongoing labor dispute, Boeing has expressed disappointment, stated no further talks are scheduled, and confirmed it will continue its contingency plan of hiring permanent replacement workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion held in money market funds, analysts are debating whether anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts will prompt a massive shift of this cash into the stock market. While some believe lower yields on cash-equivalent investments will push investors toward riskier assets, others argue that much of this capital, especially institutional funds, is unlikely to move. The article explores the complexities of investor behavior, noting that money fund assets have historically only declined during periods of extreme economic stress and near-zero interest rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides advice for individuals looking to purchase a home as mortgage rates decline ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut. It highlights that timing is crucial, as lenders often adjust rates before formal Fed action, and stresses the importance of a high credit score to secure the best offers. Prospective buyers are also reminded to obtain pre-approval to demonstrate seriousness to sellers and to prioritize finding their ideal home over waiting for potentially lower rates, which may be a risky strategy.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police has suspended nine officers after a BBC investigation uncovered serious allegations of misconduct at the Charing Cross police station. The claims, which are now being investigated by the police watchdog, include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and a failure to challenge inappropriate behavior. This incident follows a 2022 report that exposed a "disgraceful" culture of racism and misogyny at the very same station, prompting renewed concerns about its internal culture.</p>

          <p>The Broward Sheriff's Office in South Florida has fired six more deputies and disciplined eleven others for their failure to properly handle the case of Mary Gingles, who was murdered by her estranged husband. Gingles had repeatedly warned officers for months that she feared for her life, but an internal investigation found that deputies failed to act with the required urgency. Her husband ultimately killed her, her father, and a neighbor, leading to intense scrutiny of the department's handling of domestic violence cases.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether it is advisable for savers to renew a Certificate of Deposit (CD) that is maturing in September 2025, given the recent decline in interest rates from their 2024 peaks. It concludes that renewal remains a strong option, as current CD rates are still competitive and provide a fixed return, protecting funds from further rate drops anticipated from the Federal Reserve. Locking in a rate now can offer financial stability and a guaranteed earning potential in a volatile economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This commentary piece delves into the challenge of discussing the legacy of Charlie Kirk following his assassination, advocating for a nuanced approach. The author argues it is essential to unequivocally condemn the political violence of his murder without using qualifying statements.

Dowd asserts that his words were misconstrued and that the network capitulated to a "Right Wing media mob." He clarified that his remarks, made before it was confirmed Kirk was a target, were intended as a broader commentary on the toxic combination of divisive speech and gun access in the U.S., not as a justification for the violence.</p>

          <p>This article looks back at D'Lites, a 1980s fast food chain that was a pioneer in offering healthy alternatives like lean beef burgers, salad bars, and baked potatoes. Despite rapid initial growth to over 100 locations, the company filed for bankruptcy in 1986. Its demise is attributed to being ahead of its time, as the broader American public was not yet fully invested in healthy fast food, and larger competitors began co-opting its health-conscious menu items.</p>

          <p>A review of "Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale" praises the film as a satisfying and fitting conclusion to the beloved series. Set in 1930, the movie returns to the core social and family dramas of the Crawley household, effectively balancing historical escapism with themes of contemporary relevance, such as generational shifts and social change. While not breaking new ground for the characters, the film is described as a pleasure to watch, successfully delivering the charm and wit that fans have come to expect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review describes the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel "The Long Walk" as a dark and grim dystopian story. The plot centers on a televised contest where 100 teenage boys must participate in a brutal, non-stop walk where slowing down results in death, with only one survivor winning a prize. While the review commends the strong performances of the young cast, it finds the film's overall message to be muddled, critiquing the commodification of violence without fully exploring its implications for the audience.</p>
