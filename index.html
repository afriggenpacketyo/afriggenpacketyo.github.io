            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, responding to an ACLU appeal citing concerns they would be sent to a dangerous Salvadoran prison without due process. The ACLU argued the men, accused of gang ties, were being denied their right to argue their case in court. The Trump administration, however, maintains that those detained are foreign terrorists and insists it will prevail in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order.

            <p>A woman who grew up believing she was a U.S. citizen discovered she was not after applying for a passport, as her adoptive parents never completed her naturalization. She is now vulnerable to deportation to South Korea, a country she has never been to. The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 did not cover adoptees over 18 at the time the law went into effect. Advocates are pushing for Congress to remove the age cutoff and narrow the citizenship gap among adoptees, as Trump's administration has vowed to deport more people.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an emergency order halting the Trump administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, a move signaling a lack of trust in the administration's compliance with the law. The court's decision came after the Justice Department allegedly misrepresented its intentions regarding deportations. Only Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, indicating a broader rebuke from the court. The ruling highlights concerns about the administration's disregard for due process and judicial orders.</p>

            <p>Ocado issued an apology to Mumsnet for citing "hateful political views" when it withdrew from a commercial partnership due to Mumsnet's stance on the definition of sex in the Equality Act. Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts said Ocado abruptly pulled out after Mumsnet called for the act to be reformed. Ocado clarified that the comments were made by a temporary contractor who has since left the company. The apology follows a Supreme Court ruling defining a woman by biological sex under the Equality Act.</p>

            <p>Kate Maltby discusses the negative stereotypes of stepmothers in popular culture and history, arguing that these tropes have long influenced women's lives. A recent survey indicates that many single mothers are hesitant to date other parents due to the fear of being perceived as a "wicked stepmother". Maltby suggests that while stepmothers may be easy to hate, the love they can bring to a family is worth the challenge. Ultimately, stepmothers should not let fear of these stereotypes hold them back from seeking love and connection.</p>
