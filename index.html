          <p>China has unveiled a bionic jellyfish robot designed for stealthy underwater surveillance, developed by Tao Kai from Northwestern Polytechnical University. Described as an 'underwater phantom,' the drone's transparent, jellyfish-like design and near-silent operation make it ideal for covert monitoring of fragile ecosystems and underwater structures. Constructed from a hydrogel electrode material, the compact device measures 120mm in diameter and weighs just 56 grams. Its low power consumption further enhances its capability for extended, undetectable deep-sea missions. This innovation represents a significant advancement in bionic robotics and marine technology.</p>

          <p>The US has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and accompanying vessels to the Caribbean, ostensibly to combat drug trafficking. This military buildup follows a campaign where at least 10 vessels were destroyed for allegedly carrying narcotics. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused the Trump administration of 'fabricating a new eternal war,' fearing the deployment aims to overthrow him. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the US would treat narco-terrorists like Al-Qaeda, suggesting imminent land strikes. This escalation has heightened geopolitical tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell has been elected the new deputy leader of the Labour Party, just weeks after being sacked from the cabinet by the prime minister. Her victory, though not a landslide, signifies an expression of the party's current anxieties as it faces declining electoral success and public attention. Powell's return to a senior, elected role suggests an attempt to address the party's recent rows and bungles, including controversies surrounding prominent figures and by-election losses. While she insists the situation is 'rescuable,' her ability to turn the party's fortunes around remains a critical question for its future.</p>

Despite the Department of Transportation discouraging side hustles due to safety concerns in critical roles, Criss highlights the immense financial and psychological pressure on workers. DoorDash has since offered Criss $10,000 for his daughter's education, but he indicates it might not be enough to stop his delivery work.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has seen its B shares underperform the S&P 500 by 6.9 percentage points year-to-date, the largest gap this year. This underperformance is largely attributed to Berkshire's significant reduction of its Apple stake, selling nearly 69% of its shares since late 2023. While Berkshire realized substantial pre-tax gains, the decision to sell has resulted in roughly $50 billion in 'lost' profits as Apple's stock continued to surge. Buffett previously explained the sales were partly due to anticipated higher capital gains tax rates in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

Criminologists note an 80% drop in active serial killers since the 1970s, attributed to factors like DNA technology, increased public awareness, and reduced opportunities. However, the decline in real-world serial killers has coincided with a rise in mass shootings, shifting the nature of societal fear.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for the prosecution of several Biden-era Justice Department officials, including former Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith, over an FBI investigation into the 2020 election fallout. Trump accused them of authorizing an FBI probe that allegedly obtained phone records of nine Republican lawmakers. While the Judiciary Committee clarified the data covered call metadata, not content, Trump claimed officials 'cheated and rigged the 2020 Presidential Election' without evidence. This is the latest in a series of instances where Trump has urged legal action against perceived political adversaries, highlighting ongoing tensions surrounding the 2020 election and its aftermath.

          <p>Despite initial panic over AI advancements like OpenAI's Sora 2, which creates realistic videos, artificial intelligence has yet to significantly disrupt Hollywood's job market or drastically reduce filmmaking costs. Major studios, including Disney and Lionsgate, have invested heavily in AI but are struggling to integrate the technology into complex productions due to security, copyright, and technical quality issues. Actors' guilds are also resisting AI's use to replicate performances without consent. While AI tools are used for animation and dubbing, and some low-budget films benefit from visual effects savings, the technology is not yet 'Hollywood-caliber.' This indicates that human craftsmanship remains highly valued, though the industry continues its race to adopt AI.</p>
