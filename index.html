          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is taking direct action to counter China's dominance in the critical minerals market by investing in domestic production. The Pentagon recently acquired an equity stake in MP Materials, the only rare earth miner in the U.S., to secure the supply chain for materials essential for advanced weaponry like F-35s and drones. This public-private partnership is being presented as a new model to onshore industries vital to national security, addressing the U.S.'s heavy reliance on Chinese imports for these strategic resources.</p>

          <p>Charles Collins and Brian Boles, who were convicted as teenagers for a 1994 murder in Harlem, have been exonerated after spending decades in prison. The Manhattan District Attorney's office found that their convictions and coerced confessions were contradicted by exculpatory evidence, including DNA that proved their innocence. The case highlights issues of due process, as the men were interrogated as minors without an adult present. Their release marks the 13th vacated case by the DA's Post-Conviction Justice Unit since its inception in 2022, prompting new investigation protocols.</p>

          <p>Russia has dismissed President Trump's demand for a ceasefire in Ukraine within 50 days, labeling the proposal an "unacceptable ultimatum." The demand was linked to a threat of imposing 100% secondary tariffs on countries conducting business with Russia if a deal was not reached. A Russian Deputy Foreign Minister stated that Moscow prefers a diplomatic path but will continue its military operations until its goals are met. The Kremlin acknowledged the seriousness of the announcement but emphasized that any attempts to impose demands would not be entertained.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to host the National Climate Assessments on a NASA website, making the vital scientific reports more difficult for the public to access. Earlier this month, the official government websites for the climate reports were taken down, and the White House had stated NASA would host them to comply with federal law. This reversal means the authoritative, peer-reviewed assessments on climate change impacts will not be readily available through a central government portal, a move critics call an attempt to censor and bury crucial information needed for public safety and adaptation planning.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The ruling provides a one-week administrative stay, preventing the revocation of deportation protections and work permits while the court considers the case. The administration had planned to end the program, arguing Afghanistan's security situation had improved, a claim disputed by opponents. This legal challenge provides a brief but critical reprieve for the approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program, whose futures remain uncertain.</p>

Scientific analysis indicates that the heaviest storms now produce more precipitation than they did decades ago.

The Justice Department's recent memo stating no incriminating "client list" exists has caused turmoil within the movement, with some loyalists accusing the Trump administration of a cover-up. The situation illustrates how conspiracy theories about a "deep state" have become deeply embedded in a significant political coalition.

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a major policy change that bars many immigrants in detention from receiving a bond hearing. By reinterpreting a 1990s law, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) now argues that most noncitizens who entered the U.S. illegally are subject to mandatory detention, regardless of how long they have lived in the country. Previously, many were eligible to persuade a judge to grant release on bond while their deportation cases proceeded. This shift dramatically curtails an avenue for release, expanding the scope of the administration's immigration crackdown.</p>
