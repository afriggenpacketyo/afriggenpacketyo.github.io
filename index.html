          <h2>Legal Experts Suggest Trump's Actions Could Undermine Comey Indictment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 18:44:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts warn that President Trump's public attacks on former FBI Director James Comey and his influence over the prosecuting office could jeopardize the case against Comey. The indictment, charging Comey with false statements and obstruction, followed the abrupt departure of the previous U.S. attorney and the appointment of Trump's former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan. Experts like Gene Rossi and Carissa Byrne Hessick suggest Comey's defense could argue selective or vindictive prosecution, making a conviction difficult despite the high legal standard for such claims. Trump's consistent public animosity towards Comey provides strong factual evidence for such a defense.</p>

          <p>The Leigh Leopards secured their spot in the Super League semi-finals by convincingly defeating Wakefield Trinity 26-10 in a play-off eliminator. The hosts, who finished nine points ahead of Trinity in the regular season, dominated the first half with tries from Keanan Brand, Isaac Liu, and Josh Charnley, establishing an 18-0 lead. Despite Jayden Myers' reply early in the second half offering Wakefield brief hope, a Gareth O'Brien penalty and Alec Tuitavake's score put the game out of reach. This decisive victory earns Leigh a short semi-final trip to second-placed Wigan as they bid to reach their first Grand Final.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are viewing the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as a critical test of the American justice system, fearing it represents an unprecedented politicization by President Trump. Trump's history of claiming political interference by opponents, coupled with his open demands for Comey's prosecution and the appointment of a loyalist prosecutor, suggests a weaponization of the Justice Department. Experts like Peter Kastor and Andrew Rudalevige argue this overt political use of the department is a grave abuse of power. The case is seen as weak by some, potentially backfiring and setting a dangerous precedent for future administrations.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent Black liberation activist and former Black Panther Party member, has died in Havana, Cuba, at 78 due to health conditions and advanced age. Shakur, born Joanne Deborah Chesimard, was granted political asylum in Cuba after her 1979 escape from a U.S. prison, where she was serving a life sentence for the 1973 murder of a New Jersey State Trooper. U.S. authorities, including former President Trump, had long sought her extradition, placing her on the FBI's "most wanted terrorists" list. Her case remained a symbol of fraught U.S.-Cuba relations and a rallying cry for racial justice movements.</p>

Tooley, who was previously convicted for cocaine distribution in 2010, faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison due to his prior record.</p>

          <p>Shane Tamura, the gunman responsible for the deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting in July that killed four people, has been posthumously diagnosed with low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed the findings, noting that Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing CTE and requesting his brain be studied. While the medical examiner states CTE's physical and mental manifestations are still under study, experts like Chris Nowinski emphasize the need to prevent brain trauma in young athletes. The diagnosis offers a potential, though not definitive, insight into factors contributing to the tragic event.</p>

"PERSON 3," believed to be his close friend Daniel Richman, allegedly provided information to reporters.

The request comes amidst a broader campaign by Trump to target political opponents, following the recent indictment of James Comey.

          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid funding, granting an emergency request in a dispute with Congress. The 6-3 decision, with liberal justices dissenting, stated that harm to the executive branch's foreign affairs ability outweighs the plaintiffs' potential harm. This ruling, while not a final judgment on the merits, allows the president to use a "pocket rescission" maneuver, which the Government Accountability Office previously deemed illegal.

While an unlikely collision, CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan notes that a weaker system is usually absorbed by a stronger one. If interaction occurs, it could slightly alter their forecast paths, which currently show Humberto moving northwest and the second system tracking towards the Bahamas.</p>

Brashers, a convicted serial killer and sexual assaulter, died by suicide in 1999.

          <p>A 13-year-old boy has been arrested in Lincolnshire, England, following a series of four alleged hit-and-run incidents on Friday that injured three cyclists and an elderly pedestrian. Police believe the incidents, which occurred across Boston, Maltby Le Marsh, Alford, and Calceby, are linked and involved a black Range Rover that failed to stop at any scene. The teenager faces multiple charges, including causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving whilst unfit through drugs, and driving without a license or insurance.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly intensified into a Category 3 storm in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, but no immediate watches or warnings have been issued for the U.S. by the National Hurricane Center. This marks Humberto as the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and forecasters predict further strengthening over the coming days. The hurricane center is also monitoring a second system in the northeastern Caribbean, expected to become a tropical depression and potentially bring heavy rains to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before tracking towards the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>A 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner, Rafie Ollah Shouhed, is suing the federal government for $50 million, alleging he suffered broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury during a violent ICE raid this month. His attorney claims masked agents "slammed" Shouhed to the ground and detained him for nearly 12 hours despite his U.S. citizenship and recent heart surgery. This incident occurs amid the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign in Southern California, which has reportedly swept up numerous U.S. citizens. Shouhed's lawsuit alleges assault, battery, and unconstitutional racial profiling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at City of Hope have discovered that a genetically engineered component of deathstalker scorpion venom, called chlorotoxin, shows promise in targeting cancerous brain tumors. This innovative chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy uses chlorotoxin to guide the body's T cells to glioblastoma tumor cells, acting as a "radar" for these hard-to-treat cancers. Early phase one clinical trials found the treatment "well tolerated" by patients, with 75% achieving stable disease temporarily. While all four participants eventually succumbed to disease progression, the findings motivate further research to enhance the treatment's potency, building on historical uses of animal toxins in medicine.</p>

          <p>Retired U.S. financier Howard Rubin has been arrested on sexual assault trafficking charges, accused of trafficking dozens of women, including former Playboy models, for sexual and physical assault in his New York City penthouse. Authorities allege Rubin and his former assistant, Jennifer Powers, recruited desperate women, some with prior trauma or addiction, between 2009 and 2019, encouraging drug use before encounters. The penthouse featured a "Dungeon" with bondage instruments, where women reportedly suffered significant pain and trauma. Rubin allegedly funded Powers' lifestyle, and both face mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years to life if convicted.</p>

          <p>An influx of federal agents from 13 U.S. agencies, alongside 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers, will deploy to Memphis starting next week as part of a broader crime crackdown initiated by President Trump. Governor Bill Lee described the operation as a "generational opportunity" to combat crime, with National Guard troops providing unarmed support roles if requested. Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community questions but emphasized using resources effectively, noting the city's existing efforts to reduce violent crime. This initiative follows Trump's characterization of Memphis as overwhelmed by crime and accusations of targeting Democratic-led cities with federal interventions.</p>

          <p>Hackers identifying as "Radiant" are threatening to publish more private data of nursery children and their families unless a ransom is paid, following a breach of the Kido nursery chain. The criminals have already posted profiles of 20 children, including pictures and personal details, and exposed employee data like names and national insurance numbers. Kido, working with authorities and the Met Police, confirmed the breach occurred via a software service called Famly, which asserts its own security was not compromised. Parents have reported threatening phone calls from the hackers, intensifying fears over the "barbaric" exploitation of children's data.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 16:26:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has argued to the Supreme Court that President Trump's potential firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged misconduct would not trigger a "financial market disaster." Solicitor General D. John Sauer contended that recognizing the president's power to remove governors for financial misfeasance, even pre-appointment, would not compromise the Fed's policy independence. Trump moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Cook's attorneys argue her removal would "eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board" and risk market chaos, but the DOJ maintains markets would differentiate between misconduct and policy independence.
