          <p>Homebuilder sentiment in June fell to near pandemic lows, reflecting concerns about economic uncertainty and rising mortgage rates. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped two points to 32, indicating a negative outlook as buyer traffic hit its lowest level since late 2023. A growing number of builders are cutting prices to address affordability concerns, with 37% reporting price reductions in June. Analysts anticipate a decline in single-family housing starts for 2025, driven by rising inventory levels and hesitant buyers awaiting improved affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least seven people, including a child, died in northern West Virginia due to flash floods caused by heavy rains, with some areas receiving up to four inches of rain in just 30 minutes.

Emergency responders conducted numerous water rescues, while authorities assessed the extent of the damage and worked to restore power amidst natural gas leaks. Governor Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay off the roads due to the ongoing danger of flooding in the region, as recovery efforts are underway with support from FEMA and the National Guard.</p>

          <p>After almost a century, Germany has reached an agreement with the House of Hohenzollern, the noble family of the last German Emperor, Wilhelm II, resolving a long-standing dispute over art objects and compensation claims. The agreement establishes the "Hohenzollern Art Foundation" to manage approximately 3,000 art and cultural objects, ensuring they remain in public museums. The settlement addresses claims for expropriated palaces and inventory, with the public benefiting from access to the collections. The dispute centered on whether the Hohenzollerns aided the Nazis, impacting their compensation rights, but negotiations ultimately led to a mutually beneficial resolution.</p>

          <p>Despite a growing alliance and a new defense pact, Russia is unlikely to provide military aid to Iran in its conflict with Israel. While President Vladimir Putin has expressed condolences and condemned Israel's actions, Moscow's primary focus is avoiding regional chaos and maintaining its own interests. Russia's strategic partnership with Iran has strengthened due to Western sanctions and economic ties, but direct military support is unlikely, as Moscow seeks to balance relations with other nations. Russia may act as a mediator between Iran and its opponents, leveraging its existing communication channels.</p>

          <p>The Senate is progressing toward final passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill that establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support but faced opposition after concerns arose about an Abu Dhabi-backed firm investing in Binance using stablecoin purchased from a Trump family-linked firm. Amendments were added to address corruption concerns and protect consumers, requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings and directing the Treasury to monitor suspicious transactions. Some Democrats still express concerns, and two Republicans consistently vote against the bill.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to work closely to tackle the crossings, with migration as a key focus of their meetings.

          <p>U.S. retail sales fell 0.9% in May, exceeding expectations of a 0.6% drop, signaling a pullback in consumer spending. The decline, following a 0.1% loss in April, reflects unease over tariffs and geopolitical tensions. A decrease in auto sales contributed to the overall downturn, as consumers had previously increased purchases in March to avoid anticipated tariffs. Despite improved consumer sentiment surveys, households are showing greater selectivity in their spending habits.</p>

          <p>The domestic deployment of active-duty U.S. military, as seen recently in Los Angeles, is a rare and potentially risky event, with parallels to the period between 1957 and 1968 when military forces were deployed on U.S. soil on eight separate occasions. These deployments, often in response to civil rights unrest and anti-war protests, resulted in few fatalities, owing to the Army's restraint and clear rules of engagement.
