Wintour, 75, will remain in her roles as global editorial director and chief content officer for Condé Nast, serving as a mentor to the 39-year-old Malle.

          <p>Widespread protests have turned violent in Indonesia, leading to at least eight deaths and over 1,200 arrests in Jakarta. The unrest was ignited by footage of elite paramilitary police running over a 21-year-old delivery driver during a demonstration. These protests are rooted in long-standing public anger over economic hardship, rising inequality, and a political elite perceived as detached and corrupt. Demonstrators have issued a list of demands, including police reform and the reversal of a lavish allowance hike for lawmakers.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Discuss Whether to Lock in Mortgage Rates in September</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates hovering near 7%, prospective homebuyers face the difficult decision of whether to lock in a rate now or wait for a potential drop. Experts suggest that while rates feel high compared to the pandemic era, locking in is advisable for those already under contract for a home to avoid market volatility. However, those with more flexibility, a good credit score they are still improving, or casually searching for a home might benefit from waiting, as a potential Federal Reserve rate cut this fall could provide some relief.

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate, due to concerns about his competency. Menzies' lawyers argued that his severe dementia prevents him from understanding why he is being executed, a key legal standard for capital punishment. Menzies was sentenced to death for the 1986 abduction and murder of Maurine Hunsaker and had chosen to be executed by firing squad. The court has ordered a lower court to reevaluate his mental state, acknowledging the prolonged suffering of the victim's family but emphasizing the need to adhere to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover's vehicle production and retail operations have been "severely disrupted" by a significant cyberattack. The company, owned by Tata Motors, stated it took immediate action by shutting down its IT systems to mitigate the impact and is working to restore operations. The attack, which began on Sunday, comes at a crucial time for UK car sales with the release of new registration plates. While the firm has found no evidence of customer data theft, the production halt at facilities like the Halewood plant represents a major operational blow.</p>

          <p>Arsenal defender Steph Catley asserts that her team has "no excuses" for not challenging for the Women's Super League (WSL) title this season, following their recent Champions League victory.

Catley emphasized the need for consistency and learning from Chelsea's ability to win even when not playing at their best. With a strengthened squad, expectations are high for the team to translate their talent into domestic trophies.</p>

          <p>Russia and China have signed a legally binding agreement to construct the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, significantly strengthening their energy and economic partnership. The deal will allow Russia's state-owned Gazprom to supply 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually to northern China for 30 years. This move provides Russia with a crucial alternative market as its gas exports to Europe have plummeted following the invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions. The agreement is a clear signal of the deepening strategic alignment between Moscow and Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has been elected as the new leader of the UK's Green Party, declaring his intention to make the party a political home for those disillusioned with Keir Starmer's Labour. Campaigning on an "eco-populism" platform, Polanski promised a bolder, more radical approach and ruled out any coalition with the current Labour Party, which he accused of selling out communities. He expressed interest in collaborating with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's new left-wing movement to challenge the government. Polanski's victory signals a potential leftward shift for the Greens as they aim to expand their parliamentary presence.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply as a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, raising the possibility of the government having to issue massive refunds. This potential fiscal strain, which could necessitate a surge in Treasury issuance, pushed the 10-year Treasury yield above 4.29%. The court's decision states that only Congress has the constitutional power to implement such broad levies. The ruling adds to concerns about the U.S. budget deficit and has contributed to a global rise in government bond yields. (not investment advice)</p>

With its vast mineral wealth, including critical rare earths, Mongolia's strategic importance has grown amid the intensifying U.S.-China rivalry.

          <p>Landslides are a common and deadly geological event, affecting millions globally and often triggered by factors like excessive rainfall, earthquakes, or human activity. This article explains that they are broadly classified into four types—falls, topples, slides, and flows—based on how the land moves. The failure of slope materials to resist downward forces is the primary cause, a pressure that can be exacerbated by natural events or industrial activities. While destructive, landslides can be prevented through engineering solutions like improving drainage and building retaining walls.</p>

          <p>Cadillac is experiencing a significant revival in the luxury car market, largely driven by its surging electric vehicle (EV) sales. The General Motors brand has seen 12 consecutive quarters of U.S. sales growth, with EVs now accounting for about a third of its recent sales. This share far outpaces the industry average and has allowed Cadillac to attract customers from rival luxury brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. While the combustion-engine Escalade remains its top seller, the success of its EV lineup marks a potential turning point for the brand.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is undertaking a major hiring initiative to recruit 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to support its planned large-scale deportation operations. The Department of Homeland Security is offering significant incentives, including signing bonuses up to $50,000, and has expanded eligibility while shortening training periods to accelerate deployment. Human rights advocates and former officials are raising alarms, warning that this rapid expansion without adequate vetting could lead to a rise in misconduct, abuse, and the infiltration of extremist ideologies, echoing problems seen during a similar hiring surge in the 2000s.</p>
