          <p>Virginia's Attorney General Jason Miyares and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears have strongly condemned Democrat AG candidate Jay Jones after private texts surfaced where he wished for a Republican rival's children to die. Miyares called Jones's conduct disqualifying, while Sears criticized a culture of 'rage politics' within the Democratic Party. Jones has since apologized for the remarks, describing them as 'embarrassing and shameful,' and stated he has reached out to the affected family. Republicans, however, view the damage as irreversible, framing the controversy as a critical turning point for the 2025 election.</p>

          <p>US envoys, including Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, are traveling to Egypt for ceasefire negotiations, as President Trump indicated being 'very close' to a deal between Israel and Hamas. The talks aim to finalize details for a hostage release and a lasting ceasefire, following Hamas's conditional acceptance of parts of Trump's peace proposal. Despite ongoing Israeli strikes causing dozens of Palestinian casualties, Trump urged Israel to halt bombing, while Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope for the return of all hostages during the upcoming Sukkot holidays. The agreement's specifics, particularly regarding Hamas's disarmament and Israel's withdrawal, remain subject to further negotiation.</p>

          <p>In a critical setback for an Oregon murder investigation, a minivan believed to be the primary crime scene for the killing of Kenneth Fandrich was inadvertently crushed at a scrapyard. Detective Devin Rigo of the Hillsboro Police Department raced to retrieve the vehicle, which was linked to suspect Dr. Steven Milner, only to find it had been destroyed a week prior. Investigators had hoped to find forensic evidence within the minivan to bolster their case against Milner, who is accused of killing Fandrich and attempting to conceal the crime. The loss of this key evidence underscores the challenges in the ongoing pursuit of justice.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors and consumers are grappling with uncertainty as gold prices reach unprecedented highs, nearing US$3,900 an ounce. Many are experiencing a mix of excitement and regret, frustrated by missed selling opportunities and hesitant to buy into the record rally. Individual investors, like Guangzhou-based engineer Yue, sold holdings prematurely, only to see prices continue to climb, leading to a shift in investment strategies for some.

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport has reopened after experiencing two drone-related closures within 24 hours, impacting thousands of passengers. Federal police confirmed two drone sightings near the runways, which prompted the temporary shutdown before the drones flew away undetected. This incident is part of a series of mysterious drone overflights affecting airports and critical infrastructure across Europe, including a recent closure at Lithuania's Vilnius International Airport due to suspected balloons. European authorities are concerned about the source of these incursions, with some experts pointing to Russia, although Moscow denies involvement, highlighting a growing challenge for aviation security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a surge in sales last year, the United States is falling behind other major markets in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with analysts attributing the slowdown to policy changes. The expiration of a significant government tax credit and new tariffs on foreign cars are expected to reverse recent momentum, leading carmakers like Ford and GM to anticipate a smaller EV market. While countries like China and the UK see much higher EV sales percentages, the US faces challenges from comparatively weaker government support and higher vehicle prices. Future growth hinges on manufacturers' pricing strategies, as some, like Hyundai, lower costs to offset lost subsidies, while others, like Tesla, raise lease payments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, ruling that the basis for deployment was 'untethered to the facts.' U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, stating that protests in Portland were not violent enough to justify federal military intervention without the governor's approval. The decision, which the Trump administration is expected to appeal, emphasizes the constitutional principle of resisting government overreach and military intrusion into civil affairs. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, celebrated the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty.</p>

Scientists confirm that while glaciers naturally fluctuate, the accelerated losses of the past 40 years are unequivocally linked to human-induced global warming. This ongoing melt has severe implications for rising sea levels and threatens mountain communities reliant on glaciers as crucial freshwater reservoirs, although limiting global warming to 1.5C could preserve half of the remaining ice.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins, previously winless, delivered a stunning 42-37 upset victory over No. 7 Penn State, sparked by an aggressive offensive plan orchestrated by new playcaller and tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a career-defining performance, accounting for five touchdowns and leading an offense that scored on its first five drives. Neuheisel, elevated just four days prior, inspired belief in his team, which became the first 0-4 or worse team to beat a top-10 opponent since 1985. The unexpected win, celebrated with chants of 'Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!' by jubilant fans, provides a moment of triumph for the Bruins amidst a challenging season.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Why 'Freshers' Flu' Is So Prevalent Among University Students</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 19:05:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University students frequently succumb to 'freshers' flu' during their initial weeks on campus due to a perfect storm of viral exposure and compromised immune systems. Dr. Zania Stamataki explains it as an 'assortment of common cold viruses' that spread rapidly in close-quarter environments like lecture halls and shared residences. Factors like late nights, poor diet, stress, and alcohol consumption during freshers' week significantly weaken immune responses, making students more susceptible to new viruses. While generally not serious, experts advise rest and seeking medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, potentially indicating secondary infections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking a Trump administration initiative that would detain immigrant children in adult facilities after their 18th birthdays. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that automatically transferring these individuals violates a 2021 court order requiring their release to the 'least restrictive setting available' if they pose no danger or flight risk. This ruling adds to ongoing legal battles over Trump's immigration policies, which have also included proposals to offer immigrant children $2,500 to self-deport. Advocates warn such policies pressure children to abandon legal claims and risk blurring lines between civil and military power.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), placing her on track to become the country's first female prime minister. The 64-year-old conservative, a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, achieved her long-held ambition after two previous attempts. Takaichi, known for her outspoken conservative views and past roles in government, has recently softened her stance on social issues while pledging to revive 'Abenomics' economic policies. Her personal experiences in caregiving and child-rearing underpin her policy proposals aimed at supporting women and Japan's aging society, as she prepares to lead a party facing trust issues and a rising far right.</p>

          <p>The United States' increasing disengagement from the United Nations, an organization it largely helped establish, is creating significant opportunities for other nations, particularly China, to expand their global influence. Annalena Baerbock, former German foreign minister, noted a collective will to choose the 'right path' for the UN, which remains adrift 23 years after Kofi Annan's 'fork in the road' speech. As the UN's main architect and largest financial contributor, the US retreat allows countries like China to step into the void, potentially reshaping international diplomacy and multilateral systems. This shift in global power dynamics presents both challenges and new avenues for international cooperation.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to celebrate the potential Gaza ceasefire deal, expressing cautious optimism for the return of hostages and an end to the conflict. The rally, held after Hamas conditionally accepted President Trump's peace proposal, reflected public gratitude towards Trump for brokering the agreement, with many criticizing Prime Minister Netanyahu for perceived delays. Protesters, like Gili Coheb-Taguri, emphasized the urgent need to bring all hostages home and restore normalcy to their lives. Despite Netanyahu's claims of a 'great achievement' and ongoing Israeli military actions, the public's mood was distinctly hopeful, albeit with lingering skepticism about the deal's finalization.</p>

          <p>A recent explosion and fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery unnerved South Bay communities, adding to the facility's long history of safety and environmental violations. The incident occurred amidst a federal government shutdown, which has furloughed key investigative agencies like OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board. Environmental advocates, such as Joe Lyou, express concern that the root cause of the explosion may never be fully determined due to these regulatory gaps, exacerbated by proposed budget cuts to the Chemical Safety Board. This situation underscores the urgent need for robust oversight and a transition away from fossil fuels to prevent future industrial disasters.</p>
