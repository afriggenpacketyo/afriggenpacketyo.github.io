        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, discusses his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," which explores the complex nature of pain. He explains that the brain is the ultimate decider of pain, capable of creating sensations like phantom limb pain or misinterpreting signals, but it can also be trained through methods like meditation to minimize discomfort. The article also covers the body's natural opioid system, which can be activated by savoring pleasurable experiences, and introduces a new FDA-approved non-opioid pain medication inspired by a unique genetic trait found in a family of Pakistani circus performers. Gupta also notes that the data supporting cannabis for pain relief is not as compelling as commonly believed.</p>

          <p>Following recent remarks by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, an expert from the Heritage Foundation has expressed concern over what he describes as a rise in "ethno-politics" and a decline in assimilation in the United States. The expert, Simon Hankinson, argues that lenient immigration policies have allowed for the importation of anti-American ideals and that U.S. leaders should have sole loyalty to America, renouncing all foreign allegiances. The article highlights speeches from Tlaib and other "Squad" members as examples of rhetoric that challenges the nation's foundations. Hankinson suggests that for some on the left, "assimilation" has become a pejorative term, undermining a shared national identity.</p>

          <p>Nadine Dorries, a former culture secretary and a staunch ally of Boris Johnson, has announced her defection from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, declaring that the Tory party is "dead." In her statement, Dorries explained that her core beliefs have not changed, but the party has, criticizing her former colleagues as "regicidal and self-serving" for ousting Johnson. She cited concerns over rising crime and the use of hotels for migrants as key reasons for her move. Dorries expressed her support for Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, stating he is the only politician with the will to address these critical issues.</p>

          <p>A carriage on Lisbon's historic Glória funicular railway derailed and crashed into a building, resulting in the deaths of 16 people and injuring 23 others. The incident, which occurred near the city's Avenida da Liberdade, prompted a massive emergency response with over 60 rescue personnel dispatched to the scene. While the official cause is still under investigation, local media reports suggest a cable fault may have caused the carriage to lose control. The transport operator, Carris, has stated that all maintenance protocols were followed and has launched its own inquiry to determine the cause of the tragic accident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook regarding allegations of mortgage fraud. The inquiry follows claims, amplified by Federal Housing and Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, that Cook lied on documents to secure a better mortgage rate by listing two properties as her primary residence.

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has stepped down from his role at Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. The decision was reportedly made by the club's ownership group, the Tavistock Group, amid a belief that new leadership is needed to achieve sustained sporting success. During his tenure, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and a Champions League final appearance, but the club won only two major trophies, leading to frequent fan protests. Peter Charrington will become the non-executive chairman in a new leadership structure aimed at bringing stability and empowering a new executive team.</p>

The rule, introduced under the Biden administration, would have required payments up to $775 for long delays. Airline industry groups, who had opposed the measure, praised the decision, arguing the regulation would have driven up ticket prices and was an overreach of the department's authority. The move aligns with the current administration's broader deregulatory agenda, leaving rebooking and vouchers as the primary remedies for affected passengers.</p>

The administration's petition to the Supreme Court describes the tariffs as its "most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative," with a multi-trillion-dollar impact. This characterization, the article suggests, fits the court's definition of a major question that would require explicit congressional authorization, which the tariffs lack.</p>

          <p>Paramount's new CEO, David Ellison, has announced that employees will be required to return to the office five days a week starting in January 2026. In a memo to staff, Ellison stated that being together in person is essential for building a stronger, more connected organization, especially in a creative business. Recognizing this is a significant change, the company is offering a buyout option for employees who do not wish to comply with the new mandate, available until September 15. This move is seen as a potential strategy to reduce headcount ahead of anticipated layoffs aimed at cutting $2 billion in costs post-merger.</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump unlawfully imposed sweeping country-based tariffs could result in tens of billions of dollars in refunds for American businesses. The court found that the president lacked the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement the levies. If the decision is upheld by the Supreme Court, the government may have to return over $70 billion collected from these specific tariffs. However, the process for receiving refunds remains uncertain, as the administration could require businesses to apply individually rather than issuing automatic reimbursements, creating logistical challenges for both companies and the government.</p>

          <p>Danish renewable energy giant Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an abrupt order to halt construction on its Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Interior Department cited national security concerns for the stop-work order, but Orsted's lawsuit dismisses this as a pretext, pointing to the president's long-standing hostility toward wind power. The company argues the order is unlawful and was issued in bad faith, putting its $5 billion investment at risk. The project, which is 80% complete, was designed to power over 350,000 homes and had already passed extensive environmental and safety reviews.</p>

A U.S. State Department spokesperson called the claims against Caterpillar and Israel "illegitimate" and confirmed that the U.S. is engaging directly with the Norwegian government on the matter.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed two lawsuits against Southern California Edison (SCE), seeking more than $77 million in damages for the utility's alleged negligence in causing two major wildfires. The government contends that faulty SCE power equipment sparked the Eaton fire in January and the Fairview fire in September 2022, which together burned nearly 22,000 acres of National Forest System lands. The lawsuits accuse SCE of failing to upgrade its infrastructure despite knowing that high winds could spark fires. This legal action adds to existing lawsuits against the utility from property owners and Los Angeles County over the destructive wildfires.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are experiencing a strong, pervasive "rotten egg" smell, which officials have traced to a large amount of decaying invasive seaweed. The seaweed, a Japanese species called Heterosiphonia japonica, was washed ashore in massive quantities by the rough surf from Hurricane Erin. The seaweed became trapped in the Good Harbor estuary by high tides, and as it decomposes, it releases the foul-smelling odor. While concerning to residents, who compared the smell to gas or sewage, the city has assured them that it is a natural process and the odor should dissipate as the seaweed breaks down.</p>

His remarks came in response to a question about whether the Trump administration would reverse Biden-era changes that allowed the pill to be prescribed via telemedicine and by non-physician healthcare providers.
