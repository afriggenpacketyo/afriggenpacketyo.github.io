          <p>In a humorous commentary, author David Sedaris reflects on the awkwardness and pressure of modern tipping culture, particularly with automated payment screens that prompt for high percentages. He contrasts the minimal effort of a server bringing eggs with the heavy lifting of buying cat litter, questioning the logic behind the expected gratuity. Through his signature wit and personal anecdotes about his immigrant grandparents, Sedaris explores the feelings of guilt and social obligation that now accompany even the simplest transactions.</p>

It discusses how she used narrative techniques like omniscience and prolepsis to "play God," creating absurdist storylines that reflect the collision between God's unknowable will and human shortsightedness.</p>

          <p>The Japanese boxing community is in mourning after two fighters, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, died from brain injuries sustained in separate bouts during the same event in Tokyo. Both boxers suffered subdural hematomas and died days after undergoing emergency brain surgery. In response to the tragedies, the Japanese Boxing Commission has announced it will reduce championship title bouts from 12 rounds to 10 and has launched an investigation into the deaths, which are the latest in a series of high-profile boxing fatalities in 2025.</p>

          <p>Companies involved in immigration enforcement, including tech firm Palantir and private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic, are reporting significant financial gains attributed to the Trump administration's crackdown. Palantir's government contracts have soared, while private detention companies are seeing record occupancy levels and are preparing for further expansion funded by a new $45 billion allocation to ICE. Critics argue these profits are derived from cruel policies, pointing to inhumane conditions in detention centers and the intrusive nature of surveillance programs run by these same corporations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing shoppers temporary relief from state and sometimes local taxes on specific items like school supplies and clothing. While politically popular, tax experts note the benefits are often overstated, suggesting they primarily shift the timing of purchases rather than stimulating new economic growth. However, for many families, especially those with lower incomes, these holidays offer a real opportunity to save on essential back-to-school shopping, particularly when combined with other store promotions and discounts.

          <p>This article discusses the psychological reason why people are drawn to negative news, a phenomenon known as negativity bias, which is an evolutionary trait for threat detection. It argues that this bias, combined with the media's focus on problems, can obscure real, tangible progress happening in the world, such as falling murder rates and fewer deaths from extreme weather. The author advocates for "realistic optimism," suggesting that focusing on positive developments is not naive but a necessary tool for fostering resilience and inspiring action to solve problems.</p>

          <p>A schoolboy out for a run on a beach in Sanday, Orkney, discovered the hull of a 275-year-old ship that washed ashore after a storm. Community researchers and archaeologists worked together to identify the vessel as the Earl of Chatham, a former Royal Navy ship named HMS Hind. The ship had a storied history, serving the British during the American Revolution before being sold as a whaler. It ultimately sank in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving the wreck.</p>

          <p>A small, round piece of a bathroom door lock proved to be the crucial piece of evidence that led to a murder conviction in the death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig. Initially reported as a suicide by her colleague Matthew Ecker, who was with her at the time, detectives became suspicious. They discovered the metal lock component underneath Pennig's body, indicating the door had been forcibly broken open *before* she was shot, contradicting Ecker's story that he broke in after hearing the gunshot. This finding unraveled his narrative and led to his conviction for second-degree murder.</p>
