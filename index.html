          <p>On Earth Day, climate activists from Extinction Rebellion vandalized the iconic Charging Bull statue near the New York Stock Exchange with neon green paint, writing "Greed=Death" on its body. The protest aimed to criticize the financial industry's role in environmental degradation and what they perceive as prioritizing profits over the planet's future. While the activists later cleaned the paint off, the incident served as a symbolic demonstration against corporate greed and its impact on the environment. This is a low optimism score because of the underlying message of panic.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. This sentiment is fueled by concerns over Musk's controversial political activities, including his support for President Donald Trump and Republican policies. The survey highlights a significant disconnect, with potential Tesla customers expressing more positive feelings towards electric vehicles in general than towards the company itself. This suggests that Tesla's brand image may be hindering its sales potential despite broader support for EVs. Optimism score is low because of the potential damage to Tesla's brand.</p>

          <p>In a 5-4 decision, Justices Gorsuch and Roberts sided with the Supreme Court's left-leaning justices in an immigration case concerning the interpretation of a 60-day "voluntary departure" deadline.

This narrow ruling could signal the court's approach to future immigration cases, including those regarding due process and birthright citizenship.

          <p>Analysts contend that firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would be detrimental to the U.S. economy, triggering market instability and undermining confidence in monetary policy. While President Trump has criticized Powell, experts warn that removing him could lead to a flight from U.S. assets and increased borrowing costs. To fully control monetary policy, Trump would likely need to replace the entire Fed Board, further exacerbating market turmoil.</p>

          <p>Data reveals a significant drop in Chinese freight ship traffic to the busiest U.S. ports, Los Angeles and Long Beach, indicating a pullback in trade between the U.S. and China.
