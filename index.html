          <p>New Jersey Representative LaMonica McIver was indicted by a federal grand jury on three counts of allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers outside an ICE detention facility.

The incident occurred during an oversight visit to the Delaney Hall detention center in Newark, New Jersey, where tensions escalated during the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a national ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime in schools to combat children's increasing screen time. The Raising the Nation Play Commission's report highlights a 50% decline in outdoor play in England due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. Recommendations include updating planning policies to involve children in new developments, protecting playtime in schools, and opening school playgrounds to the community. The commission emphasizes creating child-friendly neighborhoods and reversing the intolerance towards children playing outdoors, with some councils already removing restrictive signs.</p>

          <p>Argentina's Supreme Court has upheld a corruption conviction against former President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, resulting in a six-year prison sentence and blocking her planned political comeback. The ruling solidifies the sentence and effectively ends Kirchner's hopes of returning to a position of power. The case has been a significant point of contention in Argentine politics, with supporters of Kirchner claiming the charges are politically motivated. The conviction marks a major blow to her political career and has implications for the country's political landscape.</p>

The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have condemned the decision, viewing it as an effort to silence independent medical expertise.

While Cramer finds some of these stocks not immediately "investible," he acknowledges their popularity and the potential for opportunity, urging a closer look at these companies.

          <p>Los Angeles is bracing for the arrival of 700 U.S. Marines amid protests against federal immigration raids, a deployment that has sparked concerns among residents and officials. The Marines, joining National Guard troops, are tasked with defending federal property and personnel, but their mission parameters remain unclear. Experts warn that deploying Marines without a governor's request, which has not occurred since the civil rights era, could inflame the situation. The deployment raises legal questions, with some arguing it violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of active-duty forces for civilian law enforcement.</p>
