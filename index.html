          <p>The Philippines' justice secretary is seeking technical assistance from Japan to locate the bodies of dozens of cockfighting enthusiasts allegedly killed by rogue police officers. The case, which dates back to 2022, has regained attention after a witness claimed the victims were dumped in Lake Taal. Fifteen national police officers are now under investigation for their alleged role in the executions, which are tied to the country's massive and previously lucrative online cockfighting industry. The search requires advanced technology due to the lake's vast size and depth.</p>

          <p>The Pakistani military announced it has killed more than 30 militants in the North Waziristan district bordering Afghanistan over a three-day period. The militants were reportedly affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban, the same group that claimed responsibility for a recent suicide bombing that killed 16 soldiers. This operation is part of a surge in violence in Pakistan's border regions since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Pakistan has accused Afghanistan of not preventing militants from using its territory for attacks, a claim the Afghan government denies.</p>

          <p>A record 70 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children arrived in the care of Kent County Council in the UK on a single day this week after crossing the English Channel. This sudden spike follows a period of lower arrival numbers in the first half of the year, which the council attributed to poor weather and more accurate age assessments. Despite the earlier drop, overall small boat arrivals to the UK are up 48% compared to last year. The issue of tackling these crossings is expected to be a key topic during an upcoming visit from French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals the discovery of dozens of 300,000-year-old wooden artifacts in southwest China, providing the first major evidence of a 'Wood Age' in East Asia. Unearthed at the Gantangqing site in Yunnan province, the tools fill a significant gap in the archaeological record, as wood typically decomposes and leaves little trace. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have hailed the finding as a world-class discovery. The site, located near Fuxian Lake, had previously been named one of China's top archaeological finds in 2015 for its other significant relics.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, faced an intense overnight attack involving a record 550 drones and 11 missiles, damaging infrastructure and injuring at least 23 people. The assault occurred shortly after a phone call where Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly rejected a truce proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a cynical demonstration that Russia does not intend to end the war. The bombardment highlights the escalating aerial conflict and ongoing diplomatic stalemate between the nations.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The event, which occurred early Thursday, was witnessed by dozens of people in the west Highlands who reported an orange glow and a loud bang. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, was observed traveling at over 12,000 mph before it likely broke apart. While finding the meteorites in the vast, mountainous terrain will be difficult, hillwalkers are being asked to keep an eye out for the space rocks.</p>

The incident has prompted renewed calls for caution among tourists observing wildlife, as female elephants are known to be extremely protective of their young.

          <p>This article argues that to effectively defend liberal democracy, Americans must re-engage with its core philosophical justifications, particularly the concept of "value pluralism" as articulated by thinker Isaiah Berlin. This idea posits that legitimate human values are diverse and often in conflict, meaning no single utopian vision can be imposed without loss. Therefore, democracy's strength lies in allowing individuals the freedom to choose how to balance these competing values in their own lives.

          <p>This commentary piece contrasts the histories of two defunct Southern California seaside amusement parks: the Pike in Long Beach and Pacific Ocean Park (POP) in Santa Monica. The Pike, which ran from 1902 to 1979, developed a rackety reputation with sailors and sideshows, while POP (1958-1967) was a clean-cut, futuristic park often seen as a "poor boy's Disneyland." The article explores why the grittier park outlasted its more polished competitor, delving into the cultural shifts, economic pressures, and local developments that led to the demise of both iconic attractions.</p>

The goal of the project, released on the Fourth of July, is to remind Americans that their unifying values are greater than their political divisions.</p>

While many clubs cultivate an image as "safe spaces," Felize's story highlights the physical and social barriers that still exist, from a lack of elevators to the attitudes of other club-goers. Despite these challenges, she advocates for greater visibility and empathy, asserting her right to be part of the scene. Her experience shows that while progress has been made, true inclusivity requires more than just a welcoming door policy.</p>

A key demand for Hamas is a guaranteed end to Israeli military operations after the ceasefire period. President Trump indicated he expects to know within 24 hours if Hamas will accept the deal, which could pave the way for renewed formal talks.</p>

This decision is the latest development in a prolonged legal battle that has seen access to abortion fluctuate since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
