          <p>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is considering a subpoena for former Vice President Kamala Harris regarding an investigation into former President Joe Biden's cognitive health. The potential move comes as Harris launches a national listening tour after deciding against a California gubernatorial run, sparking talk of a 2028 presidential campaign. While Comer views her as a key witness due to her proximity to the former president, legal experts believe any attempt to compel her testimony would likely be met with significant legal hurdles, including claims of executive privilege. The situation creates a complex political dynamic for Harris as she plans her future.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has entered its August recess without an agreement to advance dozens of Donald Trump's nominees, following a contentious standoff between party leaders. Trump publicly criticized Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, as Democrats employed procedural delays to block swift confirmations, demanding roll-call votes for each nominee. In response, Republicans are contemplating rule changes to accelerate the confirmation process upon their return, a move Schumer warned would be a significant mistake. The stalemate reflects escalating partisan obstruction over judicial and executive appointments that has intensified over the last two decades.</p>

          <p>Construction of the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. This project, part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of JFK, will create the airport's largest terminal, dedicated exclusively to international flights. The design emphasizes natural light and will feature 23 gates, over 300,000 square feet of retail and dining space, and its own resilient microgrid. The development aims to modernize aging infrastructure and accommodate growing air traffic, positioning the airport for major events like the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the Trump administration's comprehensive tariff strategy, explaining that tariffs are a tool to reduce trade deficits and reshore manufacturing. Greer stated that for some countries, a set tariff rate is preferable to a negotiated deal, and that these measures create incentives for companies to invest in the U.S. He also addressed the use of tariffs for geopolitical purposes, such as in response to Canada's trade retaliation and Brazil's political situation, viewing them as a lesser-used tool than full sanctions. The administration remains in sensitive negotiations with China to avoid a significant tariff snapback. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing a continued decline in its birth rate, which dropped to 1.35 children per woman in 2024, prompting widespread societal debate. Experts attribute the trend to a combination of factors, including economic uncertainty, climate change anxiety, and high inflation affecting the younger generation's decision to have children. The issue has been politicized, with the far-right AfD party calling for more births instead of immigration. Sociologists emphasize bridging the 'fertility gap'—the difference between desired and actual number of children—by improving family-friendly policies, such as reliable child care and better work-life balance, to prevent long-term economic strain.</p>

          <p>An amber weather warning has been issued for most of Scotland as Storm Floris is expected to bring unusually strong winds to the UK. The warning, active on Monday, cautions of a danger to life from potential damage to buildings and trees, with gusts predicted to reach 70-90 mph in some areas. A broader yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. The storm's timing is notable as trees in full leaf are more susceptible to damage, and transport operators like National Rail and LNER are warning of significant travel disruptions and cancellations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme that could cost up to £18 billion for drivers affected by the mis-selling of car loans. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large commissions were unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the payout scheme, which could see most eligible individuals receive under £950, with payments potentially starting next year. The regulator stated the court's decision provides clarity on what constitutes an unfair relationship between lenders and consumers in these agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic imagines how tours at U.S. National Parks and historic sites might change under a hypothetical directive to only present positive American history. The piece humorously rewrites tour guide scripts for locations like the Stonewall National Monument, Manzanar, and the Selma to Montgomery Trail, avoiding any mention of conflict, struggle, or controversial historical figures. For example, the tour of Gettysburg focuses on Robert E. Lee's tactical mistake of fighting uphill, while the Trail of Tears is presented as a scenic walk. The commentary serves as a sharp critique of historical revisionism and the sanitizing of national narratives.</p>

          <p>Soccer superstar Lionel Messi left an Inter Miami Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes due to an apparent hamstring injury. The incident occurred around the eighth minute when Messi fell after a challenge, and he was substituted shortly after receiving attention from trainers on his right thigh. Coach Javier Mascherano stated that the severity of the injury will be determined by tests, but noted that Messi felt a pull. This injury places his availability for the upcoming match against Pumas UNAM in doubt and adds to concerns about managing the 38-year-old star's demanding workload this season.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has downplayed a public trade request from star defensive end Micah Parsons, characterizing it as a negotiation tactic. The dispute arose from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons claiming the team refused to engage his agent after a disagreement over the nature of previous discussions. Jones insists an agreement framework is in place and that the current standoff is a normal part of high-stakes negotiations, similar to past situations with other star players. Despite the public friction, several teammates have voiced support for Parsons, urging the team to secure his long-term contract.</p>

Public records show Sweeney registered as a Republican in June 2024, two years after she faced backlash for a family party where guests wore hats resembling MAGA merchandise.

The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which allows for the deployment of heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump systems on its other carriers.

The article cites several instances, including an unprompted rant about windmills and a false claim about his uncle knowing the Unabomber, as examples of digressive and incoherent speech. Some mental health professionals suggest these behaviors, such as difficulty staying on topic and confabulation, are classic signs of cognitive decline.

          <p>According to a child psychology expert, parents who effectively handle tantrums often use specific phrases that validate a child's feelings and provide reassurance rather than punishment. Instead of demanding a child stop crying, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" can help ground them and calm their nervous system. Other effective approaches include affirming "I believe you" and "Your feelings make sense" to build trust and help children process their emotions. The core principle is shifting from a mindset of control to one of connection, teaching children that they are supported even during difficult emotional moments.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues High-Profile Abuse Cases Obscure Systemic Nature of Violence Against Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 09:00:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, author Rebecca Solnit argues that focusing on individual high-profile sexual abuse cases, like those of Jeffrey Epstein or Harvey Weinstein, distracts from the systemic and pervasive nature of violence against women. She contends that treating these incidents as shocking aberrations prevents society from addressing the root cause, which she identifies as widespread misogyny. The article draws a parallel to not recognizing cancer as a disease, instead seeing only isolated tumors. Solnit calls for a broader conversation that acknowledges this violence as a constant pandemic, requiring deep social change rather than just case-by-case prosecution.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, one of the world's highest-paid athletes, recently stated that he does not know his exact net worth and is not focused on the figure. Instead, Curry said he prioritizes building a portfolio of investments and relationships he can be proud of, delegating the day-to-day financial tracking to his team. Financial planners commented that this mindset can be healthy, as it shifts focus from a potentially arbitrary number to more tangible goals and values. They suggest that concentrating on cash flow and aligning financial decisions with personal values can lead to a greater sense of control and fulfillment than obsessing over net worth.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died after being struck by a boat in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The collision, which occurred Saturday afternoon, nearly capsized the vessel and sent a passenger overboard, who was able to get back into the boat safely. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, officials plan to tow the whale to a nearby park on Monday to conduct a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death. Boaters are being advised to use caution in the area.</p>

Last week, 2,892 new infections were recorded, with the majority concentrated in the city of Foshan. While no severe or fatal cases have been reported, the provincial governor has called for resolute action to contain the spread as quickly as possible. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes fever, joint pain, and fatigue, and it cannot be spread through direct human-to-human contact. National health officials are assisting with the response.</p>

The National Youth Theatre issued a statement expressing sorrow and solidarity with Bryant and other victims of historical abuse by the same perpetrator. Bryant also revealed he has been sexually assaulted by five unnamed male MPs during his time in Parliament but did not report them due to a lack of a system and fear of repercussions.</p>

          <p>The travel industry is beginning to adopt AI for what experts call "algorithmic auditing," where systems automatically detect and bill for issues like damage to rental cars or smoking in hotel rooms. Companies like Hertz are using AI to scan vehicles for new damage, aiming for consistency but also creating a new point of friction with customers who may be charged for minor wear and tear. Experts predict this trend will expand, with hotels potentially using sensors to monitor rooms, but warn of a potential customer backlash. The key challenge for businesses is balancing the efficiency of automation with the nuanced judgment and trust essential to customer service.</p>

          <p>An American woman has been sentenced to eight years in prison for her role in a sophisticated North Korean scheme that placed highly skilled IT workers into remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies. Christina Chapman of Arizona ran "laptop farms," where she managed computers and identities to help North Korean workers pose as U.S. citizens, thereby circumventing sanctions. The scheme generated millions of dollars for the North Korean government, which U.S. officials say funds its nuclear weapons program. The case highlights the vulnerabilities in remote hiring processes, which have been exploited by state-sponsored actors since the shift to virtual work during the pandemic.</p>

Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a settled defamation case involving an Epstein accuser can be unsealed.
