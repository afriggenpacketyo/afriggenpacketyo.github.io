          <p>Stephen A. Smith, ESPN's prominent sports analyst, is actively pursuing broader influence in American media and politics, drawing inspiration from figures like Joe Rogan. Smith has been engaging with political figures from both sides of the aisle on his podcast, aiming to transcend his sports-centric image. He has even teased a potential run for president in 2028, though he acknowledges his lack of qualifications. The article highlights Smith's efforts to build a wider audience and impact, leveraging his existing platform and skills in performance and debate, while also recognizing the challenges and criticisms he faces as he ventures into new territories. The article suggests that Smith's ambition reflects the blurring lines between news, entertainment, and politics in contemporary media. Smith is also unafraid to address controversy and criticism head-on, which is a hallmark of his brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop following reports of a Department of Justice criminal investigation into potential Medicare fraud. The probe focuses on the company's Medicare Advantage business practices, though specific details remain unclear. UnitedHealth Group has refuted the report, calling it irresponsible and defending the integrity of its Medicare Advantage program. This development follows a previous civil investigation into whether the company inflated diagnoses to secure extra payments, and also the higher-than-expected medical costs, cyberattack, and murder of UnitedHealthcare's CEO Brian Thompson that the company has had to grapple with this year. The uncertainty surrounding these investigations has contributed to a substantial decline in the company's market capitalization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the U.S. economy may face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, which poses a challenge for both the economy and central banks. He acknowledged the economic environment has shifted since the Fed's strategy meeting in 2020, noting that longer-term interest rates are higher due to real rates. Powell also warned that these higher real rates could lead to greater inflation volatility compared to the 2010s. His comments come amidst ongoing economic uncertainty related to the Trump administration's tariff policies, even though recent trade deals have boosted the stock market, high tariffs are expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future.

          <p>Texas is experiencing an intense heatwave, with record-breaking temperatures sweeping across central and southern regions, posing serious health risks. Temperatures have ranged from 100F to 111F, straining public health systems and infrastructure. The heatwave is expected to persist, testing the state's power grid as energy demand surges due to air conditioning use. This extreme weather is attributed to the global climate crisis, with scientists warning of more frequent, intense, and prolonged heat waves. The rising demand is exacerbated by the growing number of industrial facilities and cryptocurrency operations in the state, which have placed even more strain on the power grid.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of a basic standard of living is widening, particularly for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity's Minimal Quality of Life index reveals that a "minimal quality of life" is unattainable for many, considering necessities like technology, education, and healthcare. The study also suggests that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a "functionally unemployed" rate topping 24% when factoring in low-wage workers and those unable to find full-time employment. The report highlights that the cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for lower-income households have fallen.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions. The justices questioned the practicality and constitutionality of the order, with concerns raised about creating a patchwork citizenship system. The administration argued that lower courts overstepped their authority, while opponents claimed the order violated the 14th Amendment. The court's decision could significantly impact the president's ability to implement policies without congressional approval and the role of the judiciary in checking executive power. The justices seemed divided on the issues, and it is unclear when a decision will be issued.</p>

The report alleges that Meta's AI chatbot systems engaged in sexually explicit conversations with underage users, and that the company loosened guardrails to make the chatbots more engaging.

These job cuts reflect ongoing trends in the tech industry, including concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on software engineering roles. Despite the layoffs, Microsoft reported strong revenue and net income for the third quarter of its fiscal year, signaling continued growth and profitability.

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka alleges federal prosecutors sought to humiliate him by requiring him to be fingerprinted and photographed for a second time after a court appearance. The charge stems from his arrest at an immigration detention center protest with members of Congress. Baraka, a vocal opponent of Trump's immigration policies, believes the move is politically motivated, carrying a maximum sentence of 30 days in prison. His attorney argues the arrest was on private property and constitutes selective prosecution. The mayor insists he did not violate any laws and was standing up for the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold requires careful consideration and isn't based on a specific timeline, such as investing a certain amount weekly, monthly, or annually. Instead, gold should be viewed as a small but important component of a portfolio, typically not exceeding 10%. The frequency of investment depends on the amount of money available and how investments will be spread out to reach the recommended percentage. Starting sooner is generally advisable, but investors should be wary of selling all of their gold investments now despite profit-earning opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a legal theory that narrowly restricted lawsuits against police officers for using deadly force, ruling that courts must consider all relevant circumstances, not just the "moment of threat." The case stemmed from a police shooting in Texas where an officer shot an unarmed Black man during a traffic stop. While the lower court had favored the officer based on the "moment of threat," the Supreme Court's decision requires a broader evaluation of the events leading up to the shooting. Justice Kavanaugh suggested the officer might still prevail under the broader standard, while Justice Sotomayor dissented, saying the ruling allows officers to "shoot first and think later."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism toward Donald Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship, questioning the constitutionality and practicality of his executive order. The order seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who aren't citizens or permanent residents, which challenges the 14th Amendment. The court's arguments focused on whether lower court judges should be able to block presidential orders nationwide, and whether this would undermine judicial checks on executive power. If Trump prevails, he could potentially enforce his desired citizenship policy in parts of the country where specific courts haven't blocked it.</p>

A twin-engine configuration could increase performance, payload, and potentially range, but would also add weight and cost.

          <p>Tommy Paul, the American tennis player, reached the semi-finals of the Italian Open, revealing that he has been "grinding" to reclaim his repossessed truck. Paul beat Hubert Hurkacz despite a stressful week off the court, where he missed payments and had his truck repossessed. He said he needed to win a couple of matches to pay off the $1,000 required to secure the vehicle's return. The former Australian Open semi-finalist is now guaranteed prize money of about Â£245,000 and will face either Jannik Sinner or Casper Ruud in the semi-finals.</p>
