          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of Tyre Nichols. The verdict followed a nine-day trial, with the jury deliberating for over eight hours.

Voight, a former leading man turned ardent Trump supporter who was given the made-up designation of “ambassador to Hollywood” by the president, along with Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson, declined to provide specifics or logistics for the plan that has raised many eyebrows – and blood pressures – in the industry.</p>
