          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its financial forecast for the year, buoyed by increasing sales to home improvement professionals that compensated for a decrease in demand from do-it-yourself customers. CEO Marvin Ellison noted that investments in stores, technology, and customer service have helped the company manage uncertainty in the housing market. Despite falling slightly short of quarterly sales expectations, Lowe's surpassed earnings estimates, anticipating improved sales trends with better weather and increased demand for spring-related items. The company is also diversifying its imports to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that investors are increasingly concerned about America's debt load, exacerbated by tax cuts pushed by the Trump administration. These investors, who influence interest rates through the bond market, are wary of the administration's tax policies and tariff volatility. The rise in Treasury yields reflects growing deficit worries, potentially impacting interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, and car loans. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that Treasury market volatility could heighten economic uncertainty, making people more cautious in their financial engagement.</p>

Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture chief to regain public trust, acknowledging his responsibility for choosing Eto. The dismissal came after the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year.

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cautioned that financial markets may be undergoing a "fundamental regime change" as investors reassess the riskiness of U.S. assets due to trade tariffs. The ECB's Financial Stability Review noted that market volatility has increased due to global trade tensions driven by U.S. tariff policy. The ECB suggested that investors may be shifting away from traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, which could have far-reaching consequences for the global financial system. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos warned of a potential market correction due to elevated valuations and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article addresses questions surrounding President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, including why it went undetected and whether it explains any cognitive decline. The article explains that Biden has an aggressive form of cancer that has spread to his bones, but doctors stopped testing his P.S.A. levels after 2014, following guidelines that advise against annual screenings for men over 69. Medical experts note that aggressive cancers can develop rapidly between screenings, and P.S.A. tests are not always reliable. The article also notes that presidents are not required to disclose their health records, raising questions about transparency.</p>

          <p>This Vox article discusses Charles Murray's 2015 book, By the People, which advocated for wealthy donors to fund civil disobedience against the regulatory state, arguing that the government had become illegitimate. The article suggests that Murray's ideas prefigured Trump's attacks on government functions, particularly through DOGE, which aimed to gut federal agencies. The article explains that Murray's skepticism of democracy and belief in the primacy of the wealthy over the law resonate with Trump's approach to governance. The article also explores how mainstream conservatives have been complicit in Trump's actions due to a shared belief that the American government is no longer worthy of respect.</p>

Cornell lamented the decline in consumer confidence and uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of tariffs, but noted that a recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China has eased some concerns.

          <p>Despite a pledge to halt fossil fuel funding at the G7 summit in 2022, Japan remains a leading public financier of gas and oil projects, particularly in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. From 2013 to 2024, Japanese public financial institutions invested $93 billion in oil and gas projects, while only $24.5 billion was provided for clean energy projects. While Japan promotes the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) to cooperate on net-zero emissions, many of its projects focus on developing natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage technology. Critics argue that Japan's approach is a form of greenwashing, as LNG involves more emissions than coal and investments continue through loopholes in the G7 pledge.</p>

          <p>Target cut its full-year sales outlook, citing weaker discretionary spending, consumer uncertainty about tariffs, and backlash to the company's rollback of key diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. First-quarter sales missed Wall Street's expectations and fell nearly 3%. The company is also implementing leadership changes and creating a new office to improve results. CEO Brian Cornell attributed many of the retailer's problems to the economy, but acknowledged that Target needs to improve its market share across merchandise categories.</p>
