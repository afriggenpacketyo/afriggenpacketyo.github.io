          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murder and attempted murder after a mushroom lunch in 2023, testified that she unintentionally served poisonous mushrooms to her family members and then panicked. Prosecutors argue she intentionally cooked death cap mushrooms for her relatives, lied to the police, and disposed of evidence. Patterson pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. She explained that her relationship with the Patterson family had become more distant and that she and her estranged husband struggled to communicate effectively when they disagreed. The trial continues with Patterson's testimony resuming on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election with 50.89% of the vote, defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland may pursue a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki's leadership. While the prime minister holds most day-to-day power, the president can influence foreign policy and veto legislation. Nawrocki's victory complicates Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse laws that politicized the court system, potentially impacting Poland's relationship with the European Union.</p>

          <p>Officials from Kyiv and Moscow are scheduled to meet in Istanbul to discuss ending the conflict that has persisted for over three years. This will be the second round of talks since the invasion began, facilitated by US President Donald Trump. The first round resulted in an agreement on a large-scale prisoner swap and discussions about a potential peace deal. The talks follow Ukraine's recent attacks on Russian airbases. The Russian delegation will present a "memorandum" of peace terms, while Ukraine seeks a full ceasefire and the release of prisoners.</p>

          <p>A Harvard Chinese graduate's speech advocating for unity in a divided world has sparked praise and criticism in both the US and China.
