          <p>President Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Washington D.C. to express support for a surge in federal law enforcement and National Guard presence. He touted the initiative as a success, claiming it has significantly reduced crime, although city data indicates a decrease in violent crime prior to the deployment. The president suggested this operation could serve as a model for other U.S. cities, despite criticism from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called the surge politically motivated and unnecessary.</p>

          <p>Powerful waves from Hurricane Erin are pushing two beachfront homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina, to the brink of collapse, highlighting an ongoing erosion crisis in the Outer Banks. Since 2020, at least eleven neighboring houses have already fallen into the Atlantic Ocean due to the region's dynamic and shifting shoreline. Experts note that barrier islands are inherently unstable for development, and rising sea levels are accelerating the loss of beachfront, putting an increasing number of structures at risk.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, a slight decrease from the previous month and the lowest rate since March. This moderation is partly attributed to the easing of rice prices, which had previously surged dramatically. Despite the slowdown, the inflation figure was slightly higher than economists' expectations, and the "core-core" rate, which also excludes energy, remained steady. The Bank of Japan continues to closely monitor these figures as it navigates its economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Families who lost babies under the care of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust feel "ignored and dismissed" after meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a national review into maternity services. They claim the meeting was unproductive and that the chair was unprepared, further fueling their 18-month campaign for a dedicated inquiry led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden. The families also criticized the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, raising concerns about its independence and ability to deliver meaningful change.</p>

          <p>A California resident has been diagnosed with the plague, likely after being bitten by an infected flea during a camping trip in the South Lake Tahoe region. Health officials confirmed the case and stated the individual is recovering at home under medical care. Plague bacteria are naturally present in California's rodent populations, and officials have identified several plague-positive rodents in the area this year. While human cases are extremely rare, authorities are reminding the public to take precautions when outdoors in areas with wild rodents.</p>

          <p>Donald McPherson, a World War II Navy fighter pilot from Nebraska recognized as America's last living "ace," has passed away at the age of 103. An ace is a pilot credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft, a feat McPherson accomplished in the Pacific theater. After the war, he returned to his hometown of Adams, where he was a dedicated community member, helping to start youth sports leagues and serving in local veterans' organizations, which his family said was the legacy he most valued.</p>

Despite changes in both nations, Ahn remains a firm believer in the North Korean regime's propaganda and views the U.S. military presence in the South as a form of colonial rule.</p>
