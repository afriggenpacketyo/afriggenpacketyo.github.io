          <p>As of July 1, 2025, the price of gold is $3,359.04 per ounce, according to American Hartford Gold. Gold is historically viewed as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge, particularly during economic uncertainty. Its price is influenced by supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, geopolitical instability, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. These factors contribute to the precious metal's constant value fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's expanded visa-free entry policy has significantly increased overseas tourist arrivals, providing a crucial boost to the country's consumption in the first half of 2025. South Korea, Japan, the United States, Thailand, and Russia were among the top sources of foreign visitors. Shanghai's Pudong International Airport recorded 2.37 million entries, while Beijing saw over 840,000 visa-free arrivals, doubling last year's figures. Chengdu also experienced a 120 percent increase in visa-free entries compared to 2024.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents bereavement leave for miscarriages occurring before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only available after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. This proposed change, which would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, aims to acknowledge pregnancy loss as a bereavement and prevent individuals from returning to work before they are ready. Campaigners and affected individuals have welcomed the move as a significant step forward.</p>

          <p>Independent analyses indicate that President Donald Trump's budget plan will add trillions to the U.S. deficit over the next decade, currently exceeding 6% of GDP. This surge, unlike past spikes, is not driven by war or economic crisis, raising concerns about fiscal health. Experts warn of potential fallout in markets, economic strain, and international relations, with some predicting a debt cycle trauma. The growing deficit could lead to inflation, higher interest rates, and reduced government capacity to respond to emergencies, impacting future generations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed his party's 'one big beautiful bill' into law, implementing significant changes to American finances. The legislation makes Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduces new provisions such as a senior 'bonus,' an expanded state and local tax deduction, and a higher estate and gift tax exemption. Additional tax breaks include those for tip income, overtime pay, and auto loans. The bill also establishes a new tax-advantaged savings account specifically for children.</p>

          <p>A hiker who fell 26 feet into a crevasse on Switzerland's Fee Glacier was rescued thanks to his long-haired Chihuahua. The man used a walkie-talkie to call for help, but rescuers struggled to locate him until they spotted his tiny dog perched next to the hole. The Chihuahua's unwavering presence guided the Air Zermatt rescue team to the exact accident site. The rescue service credited the dog's behavior for significantly contributing to the successful operation, hailing it as a 'four-legged hero'.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying pressure on trading partners to finalize new tariff deals, warning that higher tariffs could take effect on August 1. Dozens of letters are being sent to countries without agreements, with President Trump also threatening an additional 10% tariff on nations aligning with "Anti-American policies of BRICS." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that while some deals are close, the administration is applying maximum pressure.

          <p>Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a 25-year-old farm worker activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March, sparking concerns that he was politically targeted. Colleagues believe his arrest, based on a 2018 deportation order he claims he was unaware of, is part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants and labor organizers. Juarez Zeferino has been instrumental in securing significant protections for Washington farm workers, including heat protections and overtime pay. ICE denies political targeting, stating his arrest was due to an existing removal order.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is intensifying his pressure on the Federal Reserve, including a handwritten note to Chair Jerome Powell demanding lower interest rates. Trump's aggression is a notable departure from historical presidential-Fed relations, as he seeks to spur economic activity amidst trade tensions. Economists, however, assert that the Fed's independent structure limits Trump's short-term power, as the chair is just one of 12 members on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Powell has publicly resisted political influence, emphasizing the Fed's commitment to avoiding premature rate cuts that could trigger inflation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a new push to strip certain naturalized U.S. citizens of their citizenship through denaturalization proceedings, prioritizing individuals deemed national security risks or those who misrepresented felony histories. Critics warn this revives a tool of political repression, echoing tactics from the Red Scare era, and could chill free speech among naturalized citizens. While the Supreme Court limited denaturalization in 1967, the administration is relying on an 'unlawfully procured' exception. Concerns are rising about due process, as cases may proceed in civil court without guaranteed legal counsel.</p>
