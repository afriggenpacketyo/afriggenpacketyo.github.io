          <p>Canada's CBC and CTV projected that Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal party won the snap election, though without securing a majority. The election took place against a backdrop of economic concerns and renewed calls from US President Donald Trump to make Canada the 51st state. Carney's victory marks a comeback for the Liberals, whose popularity had declined before Justin Trudeau's resignation. Both Carney and his challenger, Pierre Poilievre, rejected Trump's annexation proposal, emphasizing Canada's sovereignty and independence. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the legal journal was selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. This announcement comes amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Harvard over demands for changes, including dismantling DEI programs. The investigations will examine Harvard's relationship with the Law Review, including financial ties and selection policies, to determine if they violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Harvard Law School has stated its commitment to ensuring compliance with applicable laws. Optimism Score: 50</p>
