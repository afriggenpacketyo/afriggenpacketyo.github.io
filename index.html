        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) over allegations of discriminatory hiring practices. The probe focuses on whether CalEPA's policies, which promote using a "racial equity lens" and considering "lived experience" in hiring, violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The DOJ's letter specifically cites a CalEPA document that encourages diverse interview panels and screening criteria that include cultural competency. This action reflects a broader scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies within government agencies.</p>

          <p>Italy's banking sector is experiencing a turbulent period of mergers and acquisitions, with several high-profile takeover bids recently collapsing or facing significant hurdles. Deals involving major lenders like UniCredit, Banco BPM, and Mediobanca have faltered due to government intervention and shareholder opposition, leaving the consolidation wave in a state of uncertainty. Despite these setbacks, analysts believe the drive for M&A will continue as Italian banks seek to increase their scale to compete with larger European and U.S. counterparts. The evolving situation is seen as a key test for how banking consolidation can progress within the broader European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is planning the first test launch of its new Soyuz-5 rocket in December, a significant milestone for its space program which has faced funding issues since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The medium-class rocket, developed over a decade and powered by new RD-171MV engines, is designed to be an all-Russian vehicle, reducing reliance on foreign components. This development comes after the European Space Agency severed ties with Roscosmos, forcing a shift in launch strategy from French Guiana to Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch represents a key effort for Russia to maintain its relevance in the global space industry.</p>

Simultaneously, former first lady Kim Keon Hee, Yoon's wife, faces charges of corruption and bribery, including allegations of funding a stock manipulation scheme and accepting luxury gifts in exchange for favors. These indictments follow President Yoon's impeachment and arrest over the martial law bid.

          <p>The White House has named Jim O'Neill, a deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the new acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The appointment follows the abrupt dismissal of Dr. Susan Monarez after just one month in the role, a move her lawyers have called illegal. The leadership change has triggered the resignation of at least three other senior CDC officials, who cited concerns over the agency's vaccine policies and the leadership of Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic. This turmoil places the prominent public health agency at the center of a political and scientific controversy.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, marking Modi's first visit to China in seven years. The meeting occurs as both nations face economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, potentially pushing them toward cautious cooperation despite deep-seated mistrust stemming from border disputes and strategic competition. While a major diplomatic breakthrough is unlikely, the talks signal a willingness to find common ground on economic issues, as India remains heavily reliant on China for key industrial components. The summit will test whether shared challenges can temporarily outweigh their long-standing adversarial relationship.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the long-standing "de minimis" rule, which previously allowed international packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free. Effective Friday, all global parcel imports are subject to normal duty rates, a change the White House says is permanent and will generate up to $10 billion in annual revenue. Officials state the move will also help restrict the flow of narcotics like fentanyl. A six-month transition period allows foreign postal services to opt for a flat duty rate, ranging from $80 to $200 per package, to ease the adjustment to the new, more stringent import regulations.

Business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses warn the policy creates significant new barriers for smaller UK companies trying to compete internationally.

          <p>Luo Weiwei, a former NASA scientist, has become a pivotal figure in China's push for semiconductor independence through her company, Innoscience. Founded in 2015, the firm specializes in gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a next-generation material that enhances power efficiency. Innoscience recently became an unexpected supplier for Nvidia's advanced AI data center power architecture, showcasing its global competitiveness. By achieving mass production of 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, Luo's company has given China a significant edge in third-generation semiconductor technology at a time of increasing tech decoupling with the United States.</p>

          <p>Public health officials have identified large, brown cage-free eggs from Country Eggs LLC in San Bernardino County as the source of a multi-state salmonella outbreak. At least 95 people across 14 states have been sickened, with 18 hospitalizations reported. The FDA and CDC traced the outbreak to "sunshine/omega-3 golden yolk" eggs after interviewing ill patients. The company has agreed to recall the affected products, which were distributed in California and Nevada between June and July. Consumers are advised to discard or return any eggs with the code CA 7695 on the carton.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers who were convicted on charges connected to the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The decision was made due to concerns of potential bias after the original presiding judge allegedly made prejudicial comments, suggesting the police department was infiltrated by gang members. The three officers—Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, Jr.—had been convicted of witness tampering but were acquitted of the most serious civil rights charge. This ruling reopens a significant chapter in a case that sparked nationwide protests against police brutality.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a former Department of Justice employee with a misdemeanor for allegedly throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal officer in Washington, D.C. The man, Sean Charles Dunn, was initially facing a potential felony, but prosecutors were unable to secure a felony indictment from a grand jury. Dunn allegedly shouted profanities at a group of Customs and Border Protection officers deployed by President Trump before tossing the sandwich. His subsequent firing was touted by the Attorney General as an example of cracking down on the "Deep State," but the lesser charge significantly reduces his potential sentence.</p>

          <p>Jim O’Neill, a former biotech investor and aide to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been appointed acting director of the CDC, raising concerns due to his lack of a medical or scientific background. O'Neill previously worked for conservative tech investor Peter Thiel and served in the George W. Bush administration. His appointment is seen as a move to align the CDC with Kennedy's agenda of overhauling federal vaccine policy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, O'Neill voiced support for unproven treatments and promoted conspiratorial theories, and his selection is expected to deepen the ongoing turmoil at the nation's leading public health agency.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still fighting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for funds to complete critical infrastructure projects. Mayor Andrew Gilich states that the city is owed $34 million to finish upgrades to its sewage and stormwater systems, a project essential for future storm protection. FEMA has denied the city's request for additional money to cover increased costs, creating a stalemate that has left the rebuilding process incomplete. Biloxi's struggle is not unique, as hundreds of other Katrina relief projects across the region remain unfinished after 20 years.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, France, and Germany have initiated a "snapback" mechanism to restore United Nations sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The European powers argue the move is necessary due to Iran's "clear and deliberate" non-compliance with its commitments, including its stockpile of highly enriched uranium. This action comes after talks to revive the deal stalled and tensions have escalated. Iran, supported by Russia and China, has condemned the move as lacking legal jurisdiction but remains open to negotiations, setting the stage for a major diplomatic confrontation at the UN Security Council.</p>

          <p>Fire investigators are examining whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley may have played a role in starting the 6,800-acre Pickett fire. The blaze, which ignited on the winery's property, has threatened hundreds of buildings in the region. A source familiar with the investigation indicated that officials are looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the fire. While the official cause remains under investigation, a spokesperson for the winery confirmed they are cooperating with Cal Fire officials, as firefighters continue to battle the smoldering blaze in steep, rugged terrain.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its "customer of size" policy, sparking concern among advocates for plus-size travelers. Previously, the airline offered a guaranteed refund for an extra seat purchased for comfort and space; however, the new policy, effective in January, makes the refund conditional on the flight having at least one open seat upon departure. Advocates argue this change creates financial uncertainty and barriers for travelers who relied on the policy for accessible and dignified travel. The airline states the update is part of broader changes as it prepares to switch to an assigned seating model next year.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by BBC Verify has found that Israeli forces struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday, contrary to initial reports of two strikes. The investigation, using new video footage, identified that two staircases were hit almost simultaneously in an initial wave. A subsequent "double-tap" strike, which hit first responders and journalists nine minutes later, was found to be two separate projectiles hitting milliseconds apart. The attack, which killed at least 20 people, has drawn international condemnation, with legal experts suggesting it may have violated international law protecting medical facilities.</p>
