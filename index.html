          <h2>US Imposes Significant Tariffs on Solar Panels from Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:49:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is set to impose tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panels imported from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, following allegations of Chinese subsidies and unfair product dumping. This action comes after an investigation initiated by major US solar equipment producers seeking protection for their domestic operations. While these tariffs aim to bolster American manufacturing, they may also increase costs for businesses and consumers benefiting from cheaper solar products. The move follows Chinese President Xi Jinping's efforts to strengthen ties with Southeast Asian nations amid rising trade tensions with the US.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office plans to release data on the nationalities of foreign criminals, including the types of crimes committed, marking the first time such information will be made public. This decision follows pressure on the Labour government to disclose these figures, with officials stating the move aims to better inform the public about foreign offenders awaiting deportation. Home Office sources attribute the increase in foreign criminals awaiting deportation to early releases due to prison overcrowding, instability in some countries, and appeals against deportation based on human rights grounds. The main nationalities of foreign criminals living in the community are expected to be Albanians, Romanians, and Poles, with common offenses including drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta City Council has unanimously approved a $1.4 million settlement with Oliver Simmonds, a former Atlanta police officer acquitted in a 2019 fatal shooting. Simmonds, who was off-duty at the time, shot and killed 18-year-old D'Ettrick Griffin at a gas station after Griffin allegedly attempted to steal Simmonds' unmarked police SUV. Simmonds was charged with felony murder, aggravated assault, and violation of oath, but a jury found him not guilty after deliberating for four hours. The settlement resolves any potential civil claims arising from the incident.</p>

The stewards' decision was based on driving standards guidelines, indicating that Verstappen did not give Oscar Piastri enough room when contesting the lead. The article also notes that Verstappen's aggressive racing style, which often pushes the limits of the rules, has been a subject of debate and that the new guidelines were implemented due to his racing tactics. Piastri's performance is also highlighted, showing him as a decisive racer who is not easily intimidated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a significant downturn after President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of being "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates preemptively. Trump's remarks, made via social media, exacerbated market turmoil already fueled by his tariff plans and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all saw substantial declines, while the dollar index hit its lowest level since 2022 and gold prices reached record highs as investors sought safe-haven assets. Trump's ongoing conflict with Powell, whom he appointed, has further destabilized the market, raising concerns about the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>India and the United States have reported progress in bilateral trade negotiations following a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice-President JD Vance in Delhi. This comes as India seeks to finalize a trade deal before the expiration of President Donald Trump's pause on higher tariffs, initially set to impact India with a 27% tariff rate. Despite a warm personal relationship between Modi and Trump, trade tensions remain, with the US emphasizing a "serious lack of reciprocity" in the trade relationship. While India has reduced tariffs on some goods, key sectors like agriculture continue to be sticking points in the negotiations.</p>

Huang emphasized Japan's strong position in AI development due to its leadership in robotics and industrial manufacturing, but noted that generating intelligence requires significant energy. He suggested Japan needs to invest in new infrastructure to meet the energy demands of data centers, highlighting the challenges the resource-poor country faces in balancing electricity needs with restarting nuclear reactors and importing fossil fuels. Huang also affirmed China as a 'key market' for Nvidia despite US bans on AI chips.</p>

          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the United States are having a significant impact, with exports of these minerals declining sharply, and shipments of several items halting entirely in March. This cutback, imposed in response to US tariffs, is expected to put pressure on US manufacturers who rely on rare earths from China. The US-bound exports of tellurium, tungsten rod shipments, and other tungsten products have all declined, while shipments have halted entirely for molybdenum powder, bismuth products and another three categories of tungsten materials, according to the data.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has dropped below 140 yen for the first time since September 2024, following criticism from President Donald Trump regarding Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's monetary policy.

The dollar also faces pressure amid speculation that the U.S. administration will push Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance talks in Washington.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt the freeze of over $2.2 billion in federal grants, arguing that the action is in response to the university's refusal to limit activism on campus. The administration had demanded broad reforms at Harvard, including changes to admissions policies and the cessation of recognition for some student clubs, citing concerns about antisemitism. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the university would not comply, leading to the funding freeze. The lawsuit claims the freeze is arbitrary, violates First Amendment rights, and undermines American innovation.</p>

Central banks are generally avoiding currency devaluation, fearing it could stoke inflation and trigger trade wars.
