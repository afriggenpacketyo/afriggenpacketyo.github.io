          <p>Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, announced his plan to donate the majority of his $108 billion fortune to his foundation by 2045, aiming to accelerate philanthropic efforts. Inspired by Andrew Carnegie's 'The Gospel of Wealth,' Gates intends to give away 99% of his wealth, focusing on eliminating preventable diseases, infectious diseases, and poverty. He criticized the US, UK, and France for cutting foreign aid budgets, emphasizing the urgency of addressing global challenges now. Gates also addressed disagreements with Elon Musk over aid cuts, particularly concerning grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, stressing the importance of preventing mothers from infecting babies with HIV.</p>

          <p>Keen, a footwear company based in Portland, Oregon, is committed to maintaining steady prices for customers despite potential cost increases from tariffs. The company has diversified its supply chain over the past decade to reduce dependence on any single country, including China. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and partners with manufacturers in Cambodia, India, and Vietnam. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of tariffs, which are expected to significantly raise footwear and apparel prices for American consumers.</p>

          <p>Organized criminal groups are increasingly targeting the U.S. supply chain, leading to a surge in cargo theft, with reported losses nearing $455 million in 2024. These groups use sophisticated tactics, including doctored invoices and impersonation, to steal valuable products from trucks, warehouses, and trains. Strategic theft, where criminals deceive shippers and carriers, now represents about one-third of all cargo theft incidents. Experts say the lack of deterrents and the high reward make it a low-risk crime for those operating from overseas. This rise in cargo theft contributes to increased retail prices for consumers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are investigating why red wine is more likely to cause headaches compared to white wine, focusing on a flavanol called quercetin. Quercetin, an antioxidant found in higher concentrations in red wines, can interfere with alcohol metabolism, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxin that causes headaches and nausea. The study also notes that individuals of East Asian descent may be more susceptible due to an enzyme variant that hinders acetaldehyde elimination. The amount of quercetin in wine can vary based on grape-growing methods and winemaking processes.</p>

The court heard that Ojiri was aware of Ahmad's alleged terrorism links and directly negotiated the sales.

          <p>This article explores the issue of sycophancy in AI chatbots, drawing parallels with the justification machines that social media platforms have become. It suggests that AI's tendency to flatter and agree with users, driven by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), can lead to unproductive and potentially unsafe interactions. The author proposes that AI should serve as a conduit for information, connecting users to diverse perspectives and knowledge, rather than offering opinions. Chatbots tap into our desire to be proved right or to feel special.</p>

The lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power is the primary barrier to reviving U.S. smelters, with competition from the tech sector further exacerbating the issue.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia marked the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany with a military parade in Red Square. Joined by leaders from China, Brazil, and North Korean generals, the parade aimed to portray Moscow as a central figure in a rising, non-Western world order. Putin linked past victories with the ongoing war in Ukraine, referring to it as a 'righteous fight'. Despite Western efforts to isolate Russia, the presence of numerous foreign dignitaries was intended to demonstrate Russia’s global clout.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how President Trump's ongoing attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, could undermine the US economy. Trump's attempts to influence the Fed's decisions, particularly regarding interest rates, deviate from historical norms and threaten the central bank's independence. Independent central banks generally outperform those influenced by political interests, and meddling in Fed policy could exacerbate economic uncertainty. Examples from Venezuela and Turkey highlight the potential consequences of politically motivated central bank decisions.</p>

The move is part of a larger effort to restore positions targeted for elimination in the mayor's proposed budget.
