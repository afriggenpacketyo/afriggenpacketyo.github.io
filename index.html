          <p>In Sri Lanka, an elephant was killed by a train despite the implementation of safety measures following a previous deadly crash on the same route that killed seven elephants three months prior. The young wild elephant was struck near Habarana by the same train involved in the earlier accident, leading to an ongoing investigation by railway authorities. The incident occurred despite imposed speed limits and efforts to improve visibility along the tracks, highlighting the persistent human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka, where numerous elephants have been killed by trains over the years. Wildlife officials have reported that 139 elephants have been killed by trains over the past 17 years.</p>

          <p>Israel has acquired a trove of documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, after decades of efforts to recover his remains. The 2,500 items include documents, photographs, and handwritten letters, retrieved in collaboration with an allied foreign government. Cohen's intelligence work in Syria in the early 1960s provided crucial information that helped Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and seize the Golan Heights. The announcement comes amid efforts to improve Syrian-Israeli relations, with the recovery seen as a unifying moment in Israel.</p>

          <p>The reported success of Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets and PL-15 missiles in the recent conflict between Pakistan and India has sparked nationalist pride in China and renewed warnings to Taiwan. Pakistan claimed to have shot down Indian fighter jets, some manufactured by France, using Chinese weaponry, which some analysts see as a proxy showdown between Western and Chinese arms capabilities. Chinese commentators suggest this success demonstrates the rapid advancement of China's defense industry and serves as a warning to Taiwan. Despite Beijing's restraint, the conflict has raised concerns in Taiwan about the survivability of its aircraft against Chinese forces.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is launching offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization.

This initiative seeks to leverage the high CO2 absorption capacity of marine vegetation to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment to remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles, but only if they have abused their own children. This limitation has led to disappointment, as the original intent was to automatically remove parental responsibility after a conviction for serious child sexual assault, preventing families from needing to go to Family Court.

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a titan of Russian ballet and one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, has died at the age of 98. He served as artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, where he revitalized male dance and redefined Soviet ballet with productions like "The Stone Flower" and "Romeo and Juliet". Grigorovich's departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, amid disputes over performers' contracts, led to the first dancers' strike in the theater's 200-year history. His work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday.

CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build its factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially stripping them of deportation protections. The court granted the Justice Department's request to lift a federal judge's order blocking the decision, although an appeal process is underway in a lower court. This move drew strong reactions from activists, who deemed it shocking and warned it would force families into impossible choices. The decision underscores the administration's hardline approach to immigration.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, has been charged with assaulting federal agents during a visit to an immigration detention center in New Jersey. The charges stem from a clash outside the facility where Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested, with McIver accusing federal law enforcement of escalating the situation. Simultaneously, the U.S. Attorney's office dismissed a trespassing charge against Baraka. The prosecution of McIver has drawn criticism, with some viewing it as an attempt to stifle opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>
