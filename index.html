          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 335 individuals during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the UK government. The demonstration proceeded despite calls from police and political figures to postpone it, following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers from Defend Our Juries argued that canceling the event would be letting "terror win" and that it is possible to grieve for victims of multiple atrocities simultaneously. The significant police presence, involving 1,500 officers, was required to manage the protest and carry out the arrests.</p>

          <p>During the U.S. government shutdown, Republicans have claimed Democrats are trying to provide "free healthcare for illegals," a statement Democrats vehemently deny. The Democratic funding proposal aims to reverse cuts that affect lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, not undocumented immigrants, who are already barred from federal health programs. This political messaging shifts the debate to immigration, a topic Republicans prefer, while Democrats focus on preventing millions from losing health insurance coverage. The complex reality of the legislation is largely lost in the toxic political environment.</p>

FBI Director Kash Patel stated that such schemes are "criminal lifelines" for the Maduro regime and that the U.S. will not be a safe haven for illicit funds. One suspect has been arrested, while the other is believed to be in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, serving as Donald Trump's homeland security secretary, has stated that only "law-abiding Americans" should attend the upcoming Super Bowl, warning that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents "will be all over that place." Her comments came during a podcast interview where she also criticized the NFL's choice of Bad Bunny as the halftime performer due to his past criticism of Trump's immigration policies. The White House press secretary later clarified that there was no "tangible plan" for ICE at the event but reiterated the administration's commitment to deporting undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic suggests that while the current government shutdown may not have been President Trump's initial choice, he now embraces it as a political fight he believes will benefit him and the Republican party. Trump is reportedly using the shutdown as an opportunity to advance his goal of deconstructing the administrative state. However, there is some awareness within his administration of potential political blowback if the shutdown continues for an extended period.

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside more than £60 million for a compensation scheme for individuals who allege they were victims of historical abuse by its former owner, Mohamed Al Fayed. The redress scheme, open until March 2026, is expected to handle claims from over 100 former employees who have accused Fayed of sexual assault. Harrods stated that while it cannot undo the past, it is determined to "do the right thing." This financial provision has contributed to the company reporting a significant financial loss for the year.</p>

          <p>Days of violent protests in Pakistan-administered Kashmir have ended after a civil rights alliance reached a deal with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were organized to demand cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to benefits for the political elite. The government has agreed to the demands, prompting the alliance leader to call for protesters to disperse. The breakthrough came after a high-level delegation was sent to the region's capital, Muzaffarabad, to negotiate with protest leaders.</p>

          <p>A journal associated with the Chinese military has described new unmanned underwater systems as being "disruptive" and intelligent. The article claims these systems can operate below 90 decibels to evade sonar detection. Furthermore, they can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines to create a multi-layered strike network. This development reflects the People's Liberation Army Navy's focus on advancing its unmanned and undersea warfare capabilities, signaling a significant technological push in its naval strategy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has left the national park system in a state of limbo, causing confusion for visitors and concern among advocates. While some parks have closed entirely, others remain partially accessible with a skeleton crew of staff, leading to a lack of services, maintenance, and fee collection. This situation raises safety concerns and risks environmental damage, similar to what occurred during the 2018 shutdown when parks suffered from vandalism and sanitation issues. Gateway communities that rely on park tourism are also facing significant economic losses.</p>

          <p>Small U.S. college towns are facing economic strain due to a significant drop in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies. Universities, which rely on the higher tuition fees paid by these students, are seeing major revenue losses, impacting local businesses and employment. The administration's stricter vetting processes and response to campus protests have created a climate of fear, causing many prospective students to choose other countries for their education.

          <p>A key point of contention in the U.S. government shutdown is the urgent need to extend enhanced premium subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). With open enrollment for health plans just weeks away, state insurance commissioners from both parties are warning that the window to act is rapidly closing. If the subsidies expire, millions of consumers could see their monthly premiums more than double, potentially pricing them out of the market. This could destabilize the insurance risk pool and have severe financial consequences for families across the country.</p>

An FBI agent who refused to participate in the plan, viewing it as inappropriate for a white-collar defendant, was subsequently suspended for insubordination. Comey was indicted for allegedly lying to Congress, a move that came after public pressure from President Trump. The consideration of such a public arrest is highly unusual and suggests a politicization of law enforcement procedures in this high-profile case.</p>

          <p>In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, prosecutors in 16 U.S. states have charged 412 people with "pregnancy-related crimes," according to new research. Most cases involve allegations of substance use during pregnancy and disproportionately affect low-income women. Advocacy groups warn that these prosecutions reflect a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals for a wide range of behaviors. This trend marks a significant shift in the legal landscape surrounding pregnancy and reproductive rights.</p>
