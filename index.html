          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles may appeal to his base but risks escalating tensions. Despite reports that protests were largely peaceful, Trump administration officials cited injuries to immigration agents and slow response times from local law enforcement as justification. Over California Governor Gavin Newsom's objection, Trump federalized the National Guard, with the potential for US Marines to be deployed as well. The swift intervention reflects Trump's promise to address left-wing lawlessness, but it raises concerns about states' rights and proportionality.</p>
