          <p>A federal appeals court has voided plea deals for three men accused of planning the 9/11 attacks, a decision that prolongs the two-decade legal standstill. The ruling overturns lower court decisions that had upheld the agreements, which would have avoided the death penalty. This legal battle frustrates some 9/11 families who seek closure, while others support the move, hoping for a full trial to establish truth and justice. The case remains complex due to issues surrounding evidence obtained through torture.</p>

          <p>President Trump toured central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that have claimed over 120 lives. While meeting with local officials and first responders, the president has avoided the harsh criticism he has directed at other governors during disasters, instead highlighting his strong relationship with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. The visit occurs as local and federal responses face scrutiny, particularly concerning the adequacy of warnings and the future of FEMA. Trump has focused on providing federal support and expressing sympathy for the victims.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native previously deported despite a court order, are asking a judge to require 72 hours' notice before any new removal attempt. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face charges and his case has been marked by judicial criticism of the government's handling and lack of transparency. The judge has expressed frustration with the government's "highly irregular" process, particularly given he was already wrongfully deported once. The legal team is fighting to ensure due process and prevent his removal to a country where he could face persecution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded a surprising budget surplus of $27 billion in June, largely due to a significant increase in receipts from tariffs. This monthly surplus contrasts with the fiscal year's growing deficit, which now stands at $1.34 trillion. Collections from customs duties were over 300% higher than the previous year, reflecting the impact of new tariffs on imports. Despite this boost, the government continues to face high interest payments on the national debt, a persistent challenge for federal finances. (not investment advice)</p>

Options include applying with fully online lenders, who use digital platforms for faster processing, or choosing a no-documentation loan, which minimizes paperwork. Homeowners can also work with their existing mortgage lender, who already has their financial data, or seek lenders that use automated appraisals instead of slower, in-person ones. While these methods can provide funds in days rather than weeks, they may come with trade-offs like higher rates or stricter eligibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is in a deepening conflict with the Unite union, a major Labour party funder, over her role in the Birmingham bin strikes. The union announced it had suspended Rayner's membership after she urged striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council, though a Labour source claims she had already quit. This public rift highlights growing tensions between the new Labour government and its traditional union allies over issues like public sector disputes and workers' rights. The dispute could have significant financial and political ramifications for the Labour party.</p>

          <p>Tax experts are warning that a provision in President Trump's new tax legislation could create a "SALT torpedo" for some high-income earners. The bill temporarily raises the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 but includes a rapid phaseout for those with incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. This structure means that for every additional dollar earned in this range, a portion of the deduction is lost, effectively creating an artificially high marginal tax rate that could reach 45.5%. Financial advisors are urging affected individuals to plan carefully to avoid this unexpected tax hit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in over three decades, with more cases reported in 2025 than in any year since 1992. Health experts anticipate the highly contagious disease will continue to spread, particularly as summer travel increases. The rise in cases is occurring in what some call a "post-herd immunity" era, following pandemic-related disruptions to routine vaccinations and a rise in vaccine skepticism. Officials are urging the public to ensure their MMR vaccinations are up to date as the most effective protection against the disease.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the concept of American exceptionalism, questioning the belief that the U.S. is immune to the political and social ills seen in other nations. Drawing on recent books about Argentina's Dirty War and the democratic history of Latin America, the author argues that authoritarianism can happen anywhere, including the United States. The essay suggests that while America has much to offer the world, it also has much to learn from other countries' experiences with both state terror and democratic resilience. This perspective challenges the idea of the U.S. as a uniquely stable and virtuous nation.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has ranked the most expensive states to live in for 2025, with California taking the top spot due to high housing costs and rising insurance premiums. The report highlights how inflation and other economic pressures vary by location, with states like Hawaii, Florida, and Colorado also ranking high for their cost of living. Key factors driving the expenses include housing affordability, where a large percentage of residents are "cost-burdened," and the escalating crisis in the homeowners' insurance market. These costs are a major consideration for both residents and businesses across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

This increase aligns with a recently identified biannual surge pattern for the virus, which typically peaks in late summer and again in winter.

Credit counseling agencies can create debt management plans that lower interest rates, while credit card hardship programs may offer temporary payment pauses or fee waivers. For those further behind, debt forgiveness or settlement can reduce the principal balance owed, though it can impact credit scores. In cases of overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can offer legal protection and a way to discharge or restructure what is owed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a bill repealing a paid sick leave law that was approved by voters just eight months ago. The law had guaranteed workers could earn paid sick time and also linked the minimum wage to inflation. The repeal is a major victory for business groups who argued the mandate was burdensome, but a significant defeat for workers' rights advocates who campaigned for the measure. The move reverses the direct will of voters on the issue, though advocates are already proposing a new ballot initiative to reinstate the benefits.</p>

Patients could be referred to services like career coaching, occupational therapy, or exercise classes. The government hopes this approach will reduce long-term sickness absence and help the 2.8 million people currently out of the workforce due to health conditions.</p>

The album, which features a more alternative R&B sound, lyrically touches on his new fatherhood, his marriage, and his struggles with media intrusion. While some praised its nostalgic feel, others found it artistically lethargic and a reflection of a star caught between different personal phases.</p>
