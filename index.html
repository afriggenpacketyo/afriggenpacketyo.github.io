          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Leonard Leo, a prominent conservative legal activist, and the Federalist Society, an organization influential in his judicial appointments. Trump's remarks came after a panel of judges, including one of his own appointees, ruled against his tariffs. Trump accused Leo of being a "sleazebag" who "probably hates America" and expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society's advice on judicial nominations. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of federal courts, highlighting the appointment of conservative judges as Trump's most important legacy. The article underscores a growing rift between Trump and key figures within the conservative legal movement.</p>

Alexis Ramirez also contributed with a two-run homer for UCLA. The game experienced weather delays due to lightning and rain, adding to the tension. UCLA will now face Texas Tech for a spot in the semifinals, while Oregon will compete in an elimination game against Mississippi.

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly shifting its IPO plans from London to Hong Kong after facing regulatory hurdles in China and increasing scrutiny over its business practices. The company has been under fire for alleged use of forced labor and consumer protection law breaches, including deceptive marketing tactics. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole and potential similar measures in the EU and UK have further complicated Shein's situation. Analysts suggest that the intense criticism surrounding Shein contributed to Chinese regulators' reluctance to approve the London IPO, making Hong Kong a potentially "safer" option for the company.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing agreements with multinational pharmaceutical companies, driven by the need for cost savings. These deals often utilize a "newco structure," combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through newly established corporate entities. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar deals to license development and marketing rights for its drug candidates, including a targeted cancer therapy. This trend reflects a strategic shift among Chinese biotech firms to leverage their intellectual property amid depressed valuations and seek partnerships with global players.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signifies a potential shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the sector.

          <p>The U.S. decision to "aggressively" revoke Chinese student visas has provoked a backlash, including accusations of xenophobia, from both Americans and Beijing. The Chinese embassy in Washington lodged a "solemn dÃ©marche" in response to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's announcement to cancel visas of Chinese students in "critical fields" and with ties to the Communist Party. The embassy condemned the move as politically motivated and discriminatory, urging the U.S. government to correct its mistakes. The State Department defended the decision as crucial to protecting U.S. national security.</p>

          <p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has strongly criticized the current Israeli government's actions in Gaza, labeling them as war crimes. Olmert accuses the government of engaging in a war of devastation characterized by the indiscriminate killing of civilians and the deliberate denial of essential resources to Gazans. He asserts that these actions are not isolated incidents but rather a result of government policy driven by malice and irresponsibility. Olmert warns that Israel risks international isolation and prosecution for war crimes, urging an immediate halt to the devastating campaign.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, suggests that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new area of conflict in China-US relations. While Lian believes the chance of full-scale financial sanctions remains slim, he warns that the U.S. could gradually expand sanctions to eventually push China out of the US dollar system. Lian also notes that excluding China from the SWIFT system would significantly damage the system itself due to China's prominent role in global trade and investment. This analysis highlights growing concerns about the potential for financial warfare between the two economic powers.</p>

DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through asset sales, lease cancellations, and workforce reductions, although the accuracy of these figures has been questioned. Musk's presence in the White House raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to his companies' business dealings with the government. His work at DOGE also led to significant cuts in international aid programs and highlighted the spread of misinformation at the highest levels of government.</p>

          <p>U.S.-China trade talks "are a bit stalled" and require direct communication between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Despite reaching a breakthrough agreement in Switzerland in May, the U.S. has continued to impose tech restrictions on Beijing, while China has not significantly eased restrictions on rare earths. Bessent believes that the magnitude and complexity of the talks necessitate the involvement of both leaders to move forward. The article highlights the ongoing challenges in U.S.-China trade relations.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Ruling Allows Trump Tariffs to Remain in Place for Now</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily allowed President Trump's tariffs to remain in place, reversing a lower court's ruling that deemed the tariffs illegal. The decision follows a challenge from small businesses and states, who argued that Trump overstepped his power by imposing the duties. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened to unravel trade negotiations. The legal battle is expected to continue, potentially reaching the Supreme Court.</p>
