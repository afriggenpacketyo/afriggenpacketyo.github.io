          <p>The UK and its allies are committed to supporting Ukraine, both in ongoing conflict and for future security guarantees following a peace deal. UK Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized their readiness to secure skies, seas, and land, while dismissing Vladimir Putin's defiant statements about continuing the invasion. Healey also acknowledged US President Donald Trump's role in initiating talks with Putin, despite broader criticism of their recent meeting. The article notes intensified Russian aerial attacks and the devastating impact on Ukrainian civilians, highlighting the urgent need for a resolution.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Paris to finalize security guarantees for Ukraine once hostilities cease. While preparations are advanced, European leaders emphasize that the initiative hinges on backing from the US government. Discussions have included the prospect of sending troops, a point that has divided allies, with Russia rejecting NATO presence and Trump ruling out US ground forces. The meeting aims to clarify collective support, with the US special envoy present for talks.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing political turmoil and economic fragility, leading to comparisons with Italy's past struggles. With a crucial confidence vote looming over the 2026 budget, Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government faces potential collapse, exacerbating concerns about the nation's rising debt and deficit. Economists highlight France's fiscal outlook as currently worse than Italy's on certain metrics, prompting worries about debt sustainability. The situation reflects broader financial market nerves, with French bond yields rising as political leaders struggle to find consensus amidst public discontent over proposed cuts.

Global bond markets remain in focus, with US 30-year Treasury yields rising above 5% after a court ruled most of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal, raising questions about future tariff revenues.</p>

          <p>Martha's Rule, a vital initiative allowing patients and families to seek urgent second opinions on care, is being rolled out across all acute hospitals in England. This expansion follows a successful pilot in 143 sites, which saw nearly 5,000 calls and 241 potentially life-saving interventions. The rule was championed by the parents of Martha Mills, who died after her family's concerns were overlooked. It aims to foster a more equitable doctor-patient relationship, encouraging immediate reviews from critical care teams when a patient's condition deteriorates.</p>

          <p>European leaders are meeting in Paris to discuss security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, facing complex challenges amid the ongoing conflict and uncertain US involvement. The "coalition of the willing" seeks American backing for any reassurance force, but President Trump's shifting stance on a ceasefire and economic measures against Russia complicates planning. Experts highlight the bind Europe is in, unsure of the US commitment or Russia's willingness to agree to a cessation of hostilities. Without clear US support, options may shift towards providing more weapons to Kyiv rather than deploying troops.</p>

The tree, believed to have been planted between 1860 and 1890, was a significant landscape feature near Hadrian's Wall.

          <p>A US federal court has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut billions in research grants to Harvard University, ruling it violated the Ivy League college's free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs blocked the administration from withholding federal funding, despite acknowledging Harvard's need to address antisemitism. The judge suggested the government used antisemitism as a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated attack on universities. This marks a major legal victory for Harvard, though the White House has vowed to appeal the decision.</p>
