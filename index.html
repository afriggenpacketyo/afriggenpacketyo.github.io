          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering military action against Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, with plans for multiple strikes being discussed, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. This consideration comes amidst stalled nuclear talks with Iran, potentially due to Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. Trump is gauging the MAGA base's reaction to potential strikes with Vice President Vance, while also being briefed on security at U.S. Army bases due to possible Iranian retaliation. Israel's discovery that some Iranian air defenses were not eliminated in prior attacks has heightened concerns, contributing to the escalating tensions. Optimism is tempered given the potential for escalation, and the situation remains volatile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing damage and injuries, prompting Israeli leaders to vow intensified attacks on Iranian military and government targets, with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei being held accountable. Israeli media showed images of damage to the Soroka Medical Center, though no serious injuries were reported. Another missile hit a high-rise near Tel Aviv, with 65 people wounded in total from the strikes. Amidst the escalating conflict, President Trump is considering direct U.S. involvement in Israel's efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, having approved attack plans but awaiting a final decision based on potential Iranian concessions. The situation is dire, with both sides trading blows and civilian infrastructure at risk.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for the time being, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not occur simultaneously in July. This decision follows Yoshihiko Noda, head of Japan's main opposition party, stating he will not submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet to avoid stalling progress on critical political issues. The ruling bloc, led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party, lacks a majority in the lower house, and a successful no-confidence motion would necessitate either dissolving the chamber or the Cabinet's resignation. The House of Councillors election is expected on July 20, amidst ongoing challenges related to U.S. tariffs and Middle East tensions.</p>

          <p>Director Danny Boyle and actress Jodie Comer discuss the parallels between the Covid-19 pandemic and their new film, '28 Years Later,' a sequel to the zombie horror film '28 Days Later'. Boyle notes that audiences' experience with the pandemic has intensified the film's terror, as real-life events have made dystopian scenarios feel more plausible. The film explores life after a virus outbreak, focusing on a community of survivors and the challenges faced by a new generation born post-virus. Comer emphasizes the emotional tension of adults trying to protect children from hard truths, a theme central to her character's role as a mother in the film.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say destroying Iran's nuclear program is a difficult task due to the fortified nature of facilities like the Fordo plant, built deep underground and reinforced with concrete. Only the U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber needed to penetrate it, and multiple strikes would likely be required. Even with successful strikes, the extent of damage would be uncertain, potentially requiring ground personnel. A U.S. strike could provoke Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, escalating the conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

The government is assessing how many of the approximately 280 Japanese citizens in Iran and 1,000 in Israel desire evacuation.

The SNB noted that inflation in Switzerland dipped into negative territory in May compared to February, primarily due to declining prices in the tourism and oil sectors. The bank projects annual inflation at 0.2% this year, rising to 0.5% next year, and 0.7% in 2027, assuming the target interest rate remains at zero.

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has discontinued the VA Servicing Purchase (VASP) program, a move that is drawing criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. VASP helped over 33,000 veterans and servicemembers avoid foreclosure by offering new, low-interest-rate mortgages, but the VA ended the program due to potential costs. This decision leaves approximately 80,000 veterans at risk of foreclosure with fewer options compared to other homeowners with government-backed mortgages. Congress is considering legislation to replace VASP with a "partial claim" program, but the timeline for implementation is uncertain, leaving many veterans in a precarious situation.</p>

Computer simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system may underestimate the degree of future orbital changes caused by passing stars. While the probability of Earth being involved in a planetary collision or ejection is relatively low at 0.2%, it's still higher than previous estimates. The gravitational tug from such a star could also disrupt the orbits of other planets, including Pluto, Mercury, and Mars.</p>

          <p>Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel is urging the UK government to support the US if it chooses to attack Iran, arguing that the UK cannot "hide behind legal advice at a time of crisis". However, reports indicate that Attorney General Lord Hermer has privately raised concerns about the legality of Israel's actions in Iran, which could restrict the UK's ability to support US military action. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to meet with his US counterpart to discuss the situation. The UK previously assisted in defending Israel from Iranian missile and drone strikes last year.</p>

          <p>A gold-plated iron knife and armor fragments, believed to be made with advanced 5th-century techniques, have been confirmed as originating from Japan's largest ancient keyhole-shaped tomb mound, the Daisen Kofun in Osaka Prefecture. The artifacts, wrapped in paper labeled "Emperor Nintoku's tomb," were recently acquired by Kokugakuin University from an art dealer, having previously been held by a collector who participated in a survey of the tomb in 1872. The Daisen Kofun is under the control of the Imperial Household Agency as the mausoleum of Emperor Nintoku, although scholarly debate persists regarding who was actually buried there.</p>

An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, injuring at least 32 people, while Israel attacked a nuclear reactor in Arak.

While avoiding easy concessions is politically advantageous, the lack of a deal could have economic repercussions.
