          <p>Esteemed CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller is remembered for his legendary 32-year career and his unique, unofficial role as the meticulous record-keeper of presidential statistics. Revered by colleagues and presidents from both parties, Knoller was known for his obsessive dedication to logging every detail of a president's daily activities, from speeches to basketball games. His encyclopedic knowledge and distinctive radio voice made him a Washington institution, with the White House itself often relying on his personal archives for data. His passing marks the loss of a selfless, warm, and highly respected figure in journalism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced a significant policy shift, pledging to remove all net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies in the North Sea to maximize fossil fuel extraction. This plan directly contrasts with the Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses and pursue a transition to clean energy. While proponents argue it taps into vital national resources, critics and environmental groups have condemned the move as "reckless environmental vandalism" that would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills for consumers. The proposal echoes former U.S. President Trump's "drill, baby, drill" approach to energy policy.</p>

          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz, now 98, reflects on his seven-decade career and his commitment to supporting other artists through a major donation to Maine's Portland Museum of Art. Known for his distinctive figurative style, Katz has gifted a collection of over 100 paintings, featured in an exhibit called "Painting Energy," to help emerging artists who face the same difficulties he once did. Despite his global acclaim and multi-million dollar sales, Katz continues to paint daily, driven by a desire to explore new creative territory he finds both exciting and frightening.</p>

          <p>Israel's Defense Minister announced that a recent airstrike killed Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, marking another significant blow to the group's leadership. This development comes as Israel continues its major offensive in Gaza City, which has led to widespread destruction and a severe humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, the remains of a second hostage, Idan Shtivi, were recovered and identified, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen confirmed their prime minister was killed in a separate Israeli strike. The conflict has resulted in over 63,000 deaths in Gaza, according to local health authorities.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Six Phrases to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 09:35:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child psychologist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that fostering long-term cooperation requires building a connection based on emotional safety. Rather than demanding obedience, parents can use specific phrases to calm a child's nervous system and validate their feelings. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" shift the dynamic from an adversarial one to a collaborative partnership.

          <p>The Premier League transfer window is set for a frantic conclusion, with several high-profile deals hanging in the balance before Monday's deadline. The most significant saga involves Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak, who is attempting to force a move to Liverpool, with a potential fee approaching £150 million. Other key storylines include Arsenal's last-minute £60 million acquisition of Eberechi Eze from under Tottenham's nose and Manchester United's ongoing efforts to resolve the futures of several players, including Kobbie Mainoo and Antony.

          <p>As extreme heat intensifies, a growing number of preventable deaths are occurring inside homes across Arizona, particularly affecting low-income, elderly, and medically vulnerable residents. The investigation highlights cases where malfunctioning or unaffordable air conditioning led to fatal outcomes in poorly insulated mobile homes and RVs. In Maricopa County, nearly a quarter of the 608 heat-related fatalities in one year happened indoors, with 70% of those victims having a broken AC unit. The crisis underscores the deadly intersection of climate change, energy poverty, and inadequate social safety nets in one of the nation's hottest regions.</p>

          <p>A cold case review by Tennessee authorities has concluded that famed Sheriff Buford Pusser, the inspiration for the movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged it to look like an ambush by his enemies. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found inconsistencies between Pusser's account and the physical evidence, which suggests Pauline was shot outside their car and placed inside. An autopsy also revealed a previously healed broken nose, indicating a history of domestic violence. Prosecutors stated that if Pusser were alive today, he would face an indictment for murder.</p>

While jobs like coding and copywriting are at higher risk, new categories of work are expected to emerge, similar to past technological shifts.

          <p>Long known for its rock-bottom prices, Dollar Tree is altering its core strategy by introducing items priced as high as $20, such as seasonal inflatable decorations. This move follows earlier price hikes that brought most items to $1.25 and added a range of $3 to $7 products. The introduction of significantly higher-priced goods marks a departure from the simple, budget-friendly shopping experience that defined the brand. This change could alienate its traditional customer base and risks repositioning the retailer as just another general store, losing its unique appeal in the market.</p>

Financial experts and legal scholars warn that success in this endeavor could politicize monetary policy, erode the Fed's credibility, and destabilize the U.S. financial system. Control over the Fed's board would give the president influence over interest rates, bank regulation, and the integrity of the U.S. dollar, a move that critics compare to actions taken by authoritarian leaders in other countries.

While proponents see it as a way to address budget shortfalls and housing inequality, real estate brokers argue it unfairly penalizes seasonal residents who contribute heavily to local economies without using many public services.

          <p>As part of its ongoing efforts to combat single-use plastic pollution, the state of South Australia will ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers starting Monday. These iconic packets, a staple in Asian takeaways, are made of recyclable plastic but are too small to be processed effectively by recycling machinery. This new measure builds on previous legislation that has already banned items like plastic straws and carrier bags. The government aims to protect marine life and reduce carbon emissions, noting that without action, plastic flow into the ocean is projected to triple by 2040.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece examines the ethical complexities of the fatal heroin overdose of Google executive Forrest Hayes, questioning the narrative that placed sole blame on Alix Tichelman. The author argues that while Tichelman failed to call for help, Hayes was a willing and active participant who arranged the meeting and asked to be injected with the drug. The article suggests that holding Tichelman fully responsible for manslaughter ignores Hayes's own role in creating the tragic situation. It raises difficult questions about blame and accountability when two adults consensually engage in dangerous behavior.</p>

Featuring recent standout draft picks like Jared Verse and Braden Fiske, the defense aims to be "relentless" in pressuring opposing quarterbacks. The addition of veteran nose tackle Poona Ford is specifically intended to bolster their run defense, a crucial improvement needed to contend with top NFC running backs like the Philadelphia Eagles' Saquon Barkley.

With the board unable to issue decisions and facing legal challenges to its constitutionality from companies like SpaceX, the agency's ability to enforce labor law and protect workers' rights to organize has been severely compromised.</p>

          <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to reform the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which compensates individuals for rare vaccine side effects. Experts warn that his proposed changes could destabilize the already fragile vaccine market by increasing litigation risks for manufacturers, potentially leading them to exit the market. Altering or abolishing the program could also make it more difficult for genuinely injured parties to receive financial help. Critics view this as the latest front in Kennedy's long-standing campaign against vaccines, which could undermine public trust in science.</p>
