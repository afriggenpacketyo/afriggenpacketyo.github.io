          <p>Gold prices have reached a record high of $3,500 an ounce after President Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence shook investor confidence and undermined the U.S. dollar. Investors are seeking safe-haven assets amid growing concerns about the global trade war, leading to a rally in gold. The precious metal has gained approximately 31% since the beginning of the year, with central banks worldwide adding to their gold reserves. Analysts suggest that gold will continue to serve as an effective hedge against ongoing trade uncertainty, with further upside potential due to investment demand and a volatile macro backdrop.

          <p>A Japanese court has ruled in favor of cabin crew members, ordering Jetstar Japan Co. to pay damages and provide mandated breaks during flights. The lawsuit claimed that the lack of rest periods violated the country's labor laws, causing a high level of psychological and physical stress for the crew. The court ordered the airline to pay 110,000 yen ($780) to each of the 35 plaintiffs, emphasizing the need to protect the crew's health and dignity for safe flights. Jetstar Japan expressed regret at the decision and filed an appeal, arguing that crew rests should count as breaks.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is testing a key resistance level at $88,000 as it rises for a second day, decoupling from the stock market's recent sell-off triggered by President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin saw significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has decreased, suggesting it's acting more as an independent asset. Analysts note that while this decoupling is a positive sign, breaking above the $93,000 resistance level requires a significant catalyst such as Fed easing or tariff deals.

          <p>A top Beijing official on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong, has strongly criticized the US tariffs on Hong Kong, claiming they are aimed at undermining the city's very survival. Xia's speech, delivered at a National Security Education Day ceremony, condemned the tariffs as "extremely arrogant and shameless," despite Hong Kong being a major source of the US trade surplus.

          <p>China's shipyards are experiencing a sense of relief following Washington's decision to scale back its proposed port-fee plan. The revised plan eliminates a previous clause that would have charged shipping companies based on their number of Chinese-made vessels, easing concerns about placing orders with Chinese shipbuilders. This change is considered a significant positive development for Chinese shipyards, as it alleviates clients' worries about potential financial burdens when their ships enter US ports. The original proposals had sparked considerable criticism from the shipping and trading industries.</p>

          <p>The escalating trade war between the United States and China has pushed the global economy to the brink of recession, with neither side willing to make the first move towards negotiation. To break the deadlock, the author suggests two diplomatic paths: Beijing could publicly invite the US to negotiate in China, or a neutral third party could broker a meeting on the sidelines of a regional summit. The US government has stated that "the ball is in China's court," while Beijing's reluctance to reach out has fueled further tensions, exemplified by the US barring Nvidia from selling its H20 chip to China.</p>

This decision has drawn criticism from advocates, who argue that borrowers have experienced confusion and economic hardship due to changing student loan policies. Alongside those already in default, approximately 4 million more are 91 to 180 days late on loan payments, highlighting the challenges borrowers face in understanding and managing their student loan obligations.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs and Climate Crisis Pose Inflation Risks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While tariffs will raise prices, the climate crisis poses a more significant long-term inflation risk. Rising insurance costs due to climate-related damages, long-term effects on food supplies, and a backpedaling on decarbonization efforts contribute to this risk. Climate change is already affecting prices through insurance markets and food supplies, with projections indicating increased food inflation. The author argues that focusing solely on tariffs as a source of inflation overlooks the underlying forces that central banks cannot accommodate.</p>
