The alarm follows the passage of a major bill backed by President Trump, which the CBO projects will add $2.4 trillion to deficits over a decade. While some lawmakers call for spending cuts and fiscal responsibility, others argue for reversing tax cuts for the wealthy to address the escalating crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term 'grifter' has become an increasingly common insult in modern political discourse, used by figures across the political spectrum to accuse opponents of profiting from dishonest or shady means. This article examines the word's surge in popularity, linking it to a broader societal paranoia fueled by online influencer culture, high-profile scam stories, and a general distrust in political motivations. The piece suggests this reflects a climate where opponents are not just seen as wrong, but as fundamentally fraudulent.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People, from financially supporting Democratic lawmakers who fled the state. The Democrats left Texas to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, and Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the PAC, alleging it was illegally funding their travel and lodging. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, accusing Paxton of attempting to silence dissent and dismantle a major voter registration organization.</p>
