          <p>Retailers are reducing or delaying seasonal hiring due to economic uncertainty, tariffs, and a cooling labor market. Companies like American Christmas LLC and Radial are cutting temporary positions, while even major players like Target and Macy's are not disclosing specific hiring figures. This cautious approach, partly influenced by trade wars and the government shutdown, reflects projected slower holiday spending growth and a shift towards more agile staffing models.

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a remarkable 40% reduction in tobacco use since 2010, surpassing the World Health Organization's target and becoming a global leader in public health. This success, primarily driven by men quitting smoking, is attributed to society-wide efforts including government regulations, health campaigns, and unique regional policies like mandatory health warnings in media. While smokeless tobacco and e-cigarette use remain challenges, the region's progress is significant.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the federal government shutdown, now in its 13th day, is beginning to seriously impact the nation's economy. He highlighted the necessity of reallocating funds to ensure military service members receive pay, which in turn means holding back payments for other federal workers and services. Bessent also reiterated that the shutdown is stalling U.S. aid for farmers and delaying the release of official economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariff Actions Deemed Hurtful Political Theatre</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 08:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article criticizes President Trump's recent escalation of tariffs on Chinese imports, labeling them as "hurtful political theatre" rather than an effective economic strategy. The author argues that these actions are showmanship designed to mask administrative ineptitude and could trigger a market bubble burst due to increased dependence on China's supply chain. It suggests Trump lacks the perceived leverage and that Western powers often mistakenly assume sanctions will compel compliance. (not investment advice)</p>
