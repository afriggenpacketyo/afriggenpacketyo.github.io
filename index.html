            <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist involved in Columbia University protests, was detained by federal agents during a citizenship interview, sparking claims of retaliation for his advocacy. His legal team alleges the Trump administration is using an obscure law to deport him, citing "adverse foreign policy consequences." This detention follows similar actions against fellow activist Mahmoud Khalil, accused of supporting Hamas. Mahdawi's lawyers are challenging the detention, asserting it violates the First Amendment and aims to silence pro-Palestinian voices. The State Department has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

            <p>Research indicates a significant drop in the number of plays and musicals staged by UK's subsidized theaters over the past decade. The number of original productions has decreased by nearly a third, attributed to funding cuts, rising costs, and changing audience preferences. Some venues are co-producing more shows to spread costs, leading to bigger-scale productions. However, smaller shows and opportunities for emerging artists are being squeezed out, raising concerns about the future of British theatre.</p>

            <h2>Trump Tariffs Unlikely to Reshore Supply Chains to U.S.</h2>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey suggests that Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., with companies citing high costs as a major deterrent. Instead, businesses are expected to relocate supply chains to lower-tariff countries. The survey also reveals concerns about the Trump administration's inconsistent strategy and a sense of being bullied. Automation is anticipated to dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S., and layoffs are an immediate concern for many companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese army has created a major humanitarian crisis, displacing millions.

            <p>California's earthquake early warning system provided timely alerts to residents before a magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck, allowing them to prepare for the shaking. The ShakeAlert system, operational in California, Oregon, and Washington, uses seismic sensors to detect shaking and send alerts. Users reported receiving warnings seconds before the earthquake, enabling them to take protective actions. The system relies on apps like MyShake and built-in Android phone features to deliver alerts.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has chosen to defy the Trump administration's demands for policy changes in exchange for federal funding, learning from Columbia's acquiescence that appeasement doesn't work. The administration's allies have been clear about the goal of breaking elite higher education. With its $53.2 billion endowment, Harvard seems to have calculated that it can afford to sacrifice some money in order to preserve its status. The ultimate fate of Harvard’s federal funding is not yet clear.</p>
