          <p>Two men have been jailed for their involvement in the 2019 theft of a £4.8 million gold toilet from Blenheim Palace. James Sheen, identified as a key player, received a four-year sentence for burglary and related charges, while Michael Jones was sentenced to two years and three months for burglary. The audacious heist involved breaking into the palace and removing the functional 18-carat gold toilet. Sheen sold a portion of the gold for £520,000 within two weeks of the theft, using coded language in messages to arrange the sale, while Jones took selfies with the toilet prior to the theft. The article underscores the extensive criminal history of both men and the challenges authorities faced in recovering the stolen gold.</p>
