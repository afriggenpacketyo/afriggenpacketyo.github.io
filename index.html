          <p>President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners has sent shockwaves through global markets, causing the worst day for U.S. stocks since June 2020. China has retaliated with tariffs on American goods, and other countries are weighing their responses. Trump maintains that his tariffs represent an "economic revolution" that will ultimately benefit the U.S., but the Federal Reserve has warned of potential unemployment and inflation. The tariffs have raised concerns about a potential global trade war and a possible American recession, leaving investors and businesses on edge. (not investment advice)<br /><i></p>

          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to Labour MPs Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, who were detained upon arrival. Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to "spread hate speech," but Lammy has described the move as unacceptable and counterproductive, stating that it is no way to treat British Parliamentarians. The Foreign Office has been in contact with both MPs to offer support, and Lammy has made his concerns clear to the Israeli government. This incident has strained relations between the UK and Israel.</p>

          <p>Kenan Malik discusses Joel Budd's book 'Underdogs,' which examines the white working class in Britain, arguing that their distinctiveness is less about ethnicity and more about geography, as they disproportionately reside outside metropolitan areas with limited social mobility and opportunities. Budd identifies different types of white working-class communities: heartlands, enclaves, and colonies, highlighting the diversity within the group. The article explores the myths surrounding the white working class, particularly regarding immigration, and questions the decline of class politics in addressing their issues. Budd's work provides valuable insights into a complex and often misunderstood segment of British society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Will Hutton argues that Britain should not be cowed by Trump's protectionist trade policies but instead should seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond. He suggests that Britain should combine with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to sustain a rules-based global trading system. Mark Carney's potential role as Canadian prime minister is highlighted as pivotal in re-orienting Canada around a new global trade order. Hutton emphasizes that Britain has a choice to make between aligning with Trump's America or creating something fresh that works for Britain, the world, and the US if it chooses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan before a drill, possibly as training to counter American warships and explore alternative routes in case of conflict. The Shandong bypassed the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines, transiting via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago. This new route could give the PLA alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, a strategic chokepoint. The Shandong conducted joint maneuvers with naval and aerial units to the southeast of Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's 10% tariff on imports has come into effect, causing turmoil in global markets and prompting retaliatory measures from countries like China. The tariffs have wiped out trillions in stock market value and raised concerns about a potential trade war. While Trump champions his "liberation day" tariffs, global leaders are expressing concern about the economic damage. The UK is preparing its response, and experts predict a significant shift in global trade dynamics as countries navigate the new tariff landscape. (not investment advice)<br /><i></p>
