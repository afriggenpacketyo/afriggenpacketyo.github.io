          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of military action against Iran's Fordo nuclear site, viewing disabling the facility as crucial due to concerns about rapid weapons production. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision hinges on possible negotiations with Iran regarding its nuclear program. The UK is actively involved in diplomatic efforts, and Trump is aware of upcoming meetings between European and Iranian officials. Intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, but the intelligence community has not confirmed an order to weaponize. The president has not made a final decision and prefers to do so at the last moment due to the changing nature of war. The current situation is tense with potential for negotiation or military action. Optimism about the overall situation is limited given the potential for conflict.</p>

          <p>Department of Homeland Security agents were denied entry to Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, raising questions about their activities amid increased immigration enforcement. DHS vehicles were seen near the stadium's parking lot entrance, but agents declined to explain their presence to reporters. Sources indicated the agents had planned a briefing near the stadium but left after photos of their meeting circulated on social media. The incident occurred as the Dodgers were expected to announce plans to support immigrant communities affected by recent raids, marking a shift from their previous silence on the issue. The situation is tense as the community grapples with immigration enforcement and the team's response.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned from her position as a government whip due to disagreements over planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill, but stated that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. She had hoped to advocate for changes from within the government, but it became clear that her desired changes would not be implemented. Her resignation highlights internal divisions within the government regarding welfare policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bags have significantly reduced shoreline litter in the U.S. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that regulations decreased plastic bag litter by 25% to 47% over six years. Fees on plastic bags appear more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, though further research is needed to understand why. The study underscores the effectiveness of these policies in curbing plastic pollution, though complete elimination has not been achieved, highlighting the need for continued efforts.</p>

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized Representative Jasmine Crockett for calling President Trump's supporters "sick" and mentally ill. Leavitt defended Trump's supporters as hardworking patriots and accused Crockett of being derogatory towards nearly 80 million Americans. Leavitt also sarcastically wished Crockett continued success in the Democratic Party for the benefit of the Republican Party. Crockett had claimed that Trump's reelection was due to a national mental health crisis and that former Vice President Harris was more qualified to be president than Trump. The exchange highlights the ongoing political divide and tensions between the two parties.</p>

          <p>Israel's strikes have damaged Iranian nuclear facilities, but complete destruction requires U.S. assistance, specifically the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb. This bomb, designed to destroy deeply buried facilities, can only be carried by the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. The B-2's stealth capabilities allow it to evade air defenses and strike heavily protected targets, making it ideal for attacking Iran's Fordo nuclear site. The use of such weaponry is controversial, with critics arguing it would be a provocative move. The potential use of these weapons reflects the serious consideration being given to military options in addressing Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

The victim, Jennifer Abbott, was found by her niece and neighbors, with reports suggesting she had tape across her mouth. Police are investigating a missing Rolex watch with a diamond-encrusted face that may be linked to the death. The victim had confided in friends that she feared living in her flat due to crime in the area, particularly drug-related activity.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have dismissed charges against Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester accused of assaulting border patrol agents during an immigration raid demonstration. Mojica claimed he was brutally attacked by law enforcement during the arrest, and video footage supported his account. The U.S. attorney's office stated the dismissal was "in the interest of justice," leading Mojica and his attorney to believe authorities recognized their error. Mojica's attorney hopes this dismissal is the first of many for protesters charged for exercising their constitutional rights.

Even if the trust funds are depleted, benefits will not disappear entirely but would face a reduction.

Minervini's naturalistic style emphasizes a sense of place and the characters' states of being, with little combat and a focus on their internal struggles. The film subtly explores themes of economic inequality, brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to plague America.
