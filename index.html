            <h2>Trump's Trade Goals Face Uncertainty After Week of Tariff Reversals</h2>

            <p>After a week of dramatic tariff announcements and reversals, the article analyzes whether Trump is closer to achieving his trade goals. While negotiations with countries like South Korea and Japan are ongoing, the instability of Trump's tariff policies makes it difficult for businesses to commit to long-term investments in the US. The article also notes the risks of a trade war with China and the potential for alienated allies. Ultimately, Trump's ambitions to raise revenue through tariffs may be short-lived as businesses adapt. (not investment advice)</p>
