          <h2>Chinese Study Explores Launching Hypersonic Gliders from Satellites</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 03:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) in China has revealed the potential for launching hypersonic weapons from space-based platforms, capable of traveling at speeds up to Mach 20 and striking global targets within half an hour. The analysis, published in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, suggests that these re-entry glide missiles could compress adversary's early-warning system response time, enhancing the probability of successful penetration. This corroborates earlier reports from the US military intelligence claiming China tested two hypersonic weapons released from near-Earth orbit, which some experts had previously dismissed. The technology raises concerns about the ability to detect and intercept such weapons, potentially altering the strategic balance.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but cut its outlook for global container market volume growth due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. While maintaining its 2025 profit guidance, Maersk revised global container market volume growth to -1% to 4%. The company expects disruption in the Red Sea to continue throughout the year. These results come as the shipping industry navigates a complex tariff landscape sparked by trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. This forecast marks the first sales projection since the announcement of the successor to the original Switch. The Switch 2, priced at $449.99 in the U.S., boasts improved features. However, pre-orders in the U.S. were delayed due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo consoles are manufactured, specifically Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Prisons Minister James Timpson suggests that more offenders could be tagged instead of being sent to prison, emphasizing that he is "not soft on crime" but focused on rehabilitation. The government is meeting with technology companies to explore how technology could help monitor offenders in the community more effectively and tackle violence in prison. While critics have questioned his views on sentencing, Lord Timpson asserts his commitment to reducing re-offending by addressing issues like drug addiction, mental health problems, and lack of housing and employment for released prisoners. He acknowledges the prison system is in a state of crisis, with prisons near full capacity and increasing violence.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Nigel Farage's opposition to net zero policies aligns with the views of many voters, who prioritize cutting the cost of living over tackling climate change. A recent poll revealed that almost 60% of voters consider cutting the cost of living more important than achieving net zero, while only 13% prioritize net zero. The author suggests that this indicates a lack of genuine belief in the urgency of net zero policies, as voters are unwilling to prioritize them over personal finances.</p>
