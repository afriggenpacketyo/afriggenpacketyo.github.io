          <h2>Trump Reinstates Columbus Day Amidst Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 18:12:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his decision to reinstate Columbus Day, rejecting the practice of recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day alongside it, a move previously initiated by President Biden. Trump accused Democrats of undermining Christopher Columbus's legacy and aimed to restore what he views as traditional American icons. This decision reignites the debate over commemorating Columbus's navigation to the Americas versus acknowledging the exploitation of indigenous populations that followed, reflecting a broader conflict over how American history is interpreted and honored. This issue has historical roots in the lynching of Italian-Americans, which led to the holiday being established as a nod to the country's growing diversity.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department initially halted funding for 365 federal grant programs, impacting initiatives supporting victims of hate crimes, sexual assault trafficking, child abuse, and school violence, but has since restored funding to at least two organizations. The funding freeze led to disruptions at nonprofit programs, including potential layoffs and the shuttering of a national crime victims hotline. While some organizations have had their funding restored after public outcry, many others are still appealing the decision, raising concerns about the impact on critical services for vulnerable populations. The department maintains that these cuts align with the administration's priorities while protecting essential services for victims.</p>

          <p>Scott Kennedy from the Center for Strategic and International Studies believes the US-China trade war is far from over. The Trump administration views the international trading system as unfair to the US, leading to tariffs on rivals and allies. The administration aims to negotiate reciprocal tariffs country by country, potentially lowering them through negotiations. This strategy reflects a shift from a multilateral system to a more bilateral, leverage-based approach to trade, with the goal of achieving better outcomes for the US.</p>

          <p>Border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of a U.S. citizen two-year-old child to Honduras alongside her deported mother, claiming due process was followed. He argued the mother chose to take the child with her, despite a judge expressing concerns about the lack of meaningful process. Homan stated that having a U.S. citizen child does not make someone immune from immigration laws, even when the child has Stage 4 cancer. This stance reflects the Trump administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration and rapid deportation policies, which have faced legal challenges and criticisms.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and fire at a port in southern Iran killed at least 40 people and injured around 1,000 others. The explosion occurred near Bandar Abbas, with initial reports suggesting it was linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant. While no one in Iran suggested an attack, the incident happened as Iran and the United States met in Oman for nuclear program negotiations. The cause of the blast is under investigation, with conflicting reports on the presence of missile fuel at the port.</p>

          <p>Amid growing tensions with the US over race relations and land laws, South Africa's ANC chair, Gwede Mantashe, asserted the country's sovereignty. The tensions stem from US President Trump's criticism of South Africa's new expropriation law and his offer for Afrikaners to be admitted to the US as refugees. Mantashe criticized South Africans who have called on Trump to "punish" the country. The situation highlights ongoing debates about land ownership and race relations in South Africa.</p>

This accusation is part of a legal battle over Netanyahu's attempt to fire Bar, citing a lack of trust. The exchange of accusations is part of a case brought by watchdog organizations and opposition parties against Netanyahu's decision to oust Bar, who claims the decision was based on an expectation of personal loyalty rather than professional considerations.</p>
