          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the key elements that contribute to winning the Eurovision Song Contest, drawing from data on past winners since 2000. The article suggests that singing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and alluding to folk music can increase a song's chances. The article also suggests that elaborate staging and pyrotechnics are favored, but novelty acts are generally not successful, so fire is good, but do not burn a piano. The article humorously advises against dramatic key changes, which were once a Eurovision staple, because key changes are no longer a good choice. </p>

          <p>Starbucks workers at 75 U.S. stores initiated a strike to protest the company's new dress code, which requires employees to wear solid black shirts and khaki, black, or blue denim bottoms. The union representing the workers, Starbucks Workers United, argues that the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining. Employees are criticizing the company for selling branded clothing that they are now prohibited from wearing to work. The company stated that the strike had a limited impact, with over 99% of stores remaining open and serving customers and that they were offering two free black T-shirts to each employee.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing expectations and leading the chancellor to state that the UK is "beginning to turn a corner." The growth was primarily driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, although analysts caution that this rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. While the Bank of England lowered interest rates to 4.25%, the stronger-than-expected growth has tempered market expectations for further cuts. Businesses are expressing caution, with some absorbing tariffs and others "holding fire" on decisions due to uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering the Trump administration's bid to narrow lower court orders blocking the president from ending birthright citizenship. The high court is not examining the legality of the president's executive order, which seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to a mother or father who are in the U.S. unlawfully or on a temporary basis. The arguments focus on whether district court judges had the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. A decision in favor of the administration could allow it to partially enforce the policy while litigation continues.</p>

          <p>Harvard University discovered that a document it purchased for $27.50 in 1946 is a rare copy of the Magna Carta from 1300, worth millions of dollars. Researchers identified the document as one of only a few known copies of the 1300 version, issued by King Edward I. The document's authenticity was confirmed through comparisons with other copies and the use of ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The Magna Carta, originally established in 1215, is considered the foundation of modern democracy.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-class Americans from achieving homeownership. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes are affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach for middle-income families, particularly in cities with restrictive zoning regulations. The report identifies cities where the affordability gap is worsening and those where housing availability is improving.</p>
