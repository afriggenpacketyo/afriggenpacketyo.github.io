          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, after being arrested during a protest outside an ICE detention facility, affirmed his city's commitment to legally challenge the Geo Group, the company managing the facility. Baraka, who was charged with trespassing, claims the city hasn't received essential information about the facility's operations and occupants. He also alleges that city inspectors have been denied entry and that local laws are being disregarded. Baraka views his arrest as a symbol of the federal government's lack of transparency and accountability regarding the detention center, and he is determined to pursue the matter in court.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions that have roiled global markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in prolonged negotiations with the hope of scaling back tariffs imposed by both countries, which currently stand at 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on American imports. While expectations for a significant breakthrough are low, the talks represent a step toward defusing tensions and potentially lowering tariffs, which have disrupted trade and increased costs for businesses and consumers. President Trump has suggested a willingness to lower tariffs, but Chinese officials are pushing for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S.-mediated agreement, India and Pakistan accused each other of violating a newly established ceasefire after reports of explosions and gunfire in the Kashmir region. While President Trump announced the "full and immediate ceasefire," both sides presented conflicting accounts, with India accusing Pakistan of border intrusion and Pakistan claiming Indian violations. The ceasefire, intended to halt weeks of escalating clashes triggered by a tourist massacre, came after strikes by both nations, using drones and missiles fired from fighter jets. The United States, along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, played roles in brokering the deal, although India disputes the extent of U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, the Trump administration, initially hesitant, intervened to prevent a potential nuclear escalation. Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio engaged with leaders from both countries after evidence of increased air force activity and missile strikes near Pakistan's nuclear command raised concerns. The U.S. officials urged de-escalation, leading to a ceasefire agreement, though reports of continued violence persisted. The intervention highlights the long-standing tensions between the two nations and the U.S.'s role in mediating to prevent a wider conflict, particularly concerning Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have announced the discovery of the wreckage of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857. The ship was found after a four-year search, and the discovery has been called "significant" because it connects to stories of trade and migration, as the ship had transported over 400 Chinese miners shortly before its sinking. Researchers uncovered several components of the ship, including its windlass, and they believe the ship may have run aground on the seabed and was buried by sand.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security suggested that three Democratic members of Congress could face assault charges after a confrontation outside an immigration detention facility in Newark, following the arrest of Mayor Ras Baraka. The lawmakers, Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez, and LaMonica McIver, were at the facility for an oversight visit. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin claimed that body camera footage showed the congresswomen assaulting ICE officers, an allegation disputed by the lawmakers and witnesses.

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have arrested Willie Eugene Sims in Ohio and charged him with the crime. Ralston was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The break came when a thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the car matched Sims' print after the FBI upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm in 2018. Investigators also matched Sims' DNA to evidence found on Ralston's fingernails and the murder weapon.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer stated that the Kyiv ceasefire talks mark a 'significant moment' in securing a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, though he admitted it's not 'the end of the process.' Approximately 30 global leaders reaffirmed their demand for Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting Monday, with the threat of 'massive' sanctions for non-compliance. The UK prime minister, who participated in the virtual meeting, highlighted unprecedented unity among Ukraine's allies. Following the meeting, President Trump reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire in a call with Starmer, emphasizing that it is a demand that must be met.</p>

          <p>As negotiations intensify for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, policy experts are closely monitoring key issues. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary partial text of its bill, but significant changes are possible before the final vote. With Republican control of the White House and Congress, the package can pass without Democratic support through reconciliation. However, the narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for fiscal responsibility could complicate the process, impacting individual provisions.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid President Trump's 'Too Late' label, as the Fed navigates a complex economic landscape complicated by tariffs. Economists suggest the Fed's historical tendency to act cautiously often leads to delayed responses. The volatile policy mix, with Trump's tariffs threatening both growth and inflation, leaves Powell with limited options, potentially leading to policy mistakes. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates, but recent data has not yet shown significant economic impact from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first U.S. at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a device called the Teal Wand that collects vaginal samples for HPV testing. Teal Health aims to increase screening rates with this more convenient and less painful option. A study found at-home screening to be as effective as in-office screenings, with women overwhelmingly preferring the at-home method. The Teal Wand will be available by prescription through a telehealth service, starting next month in California.</p>

          <p>After nearly 45 years, Oregon State Police have identified a man found dead in 1980 as Larry Eugene Parks, and have named California serial killer Randy Kraft as the sole person of interest in the case. Kraft, known as the "Scorecard Killer," was convicted of killing 16 men in California, but is suspected of killing many more. The identification was made possible through forensic investigative genetic genealogy, which was used to develop a genetic profile from a blood sample.</p>
