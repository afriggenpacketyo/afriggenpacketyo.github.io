          <p>President Trump confirmed that the US military carried out air strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with Israel reportedly coordinating the strikes. The Pentagon stated that initial assessments indicate the sites sustained severe damage, though Iranian officials downplayed the impact. The strikes have heightened tensions in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, with Iran launching missiles at Tel Aviv and Haifa in retaliation. World leaders and US politicians have reacted with varied opinions, some supporting the action while others expressed concerns about escalating conflict and the lack of congressional approval. The US claims the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people and was not about regime change.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old bride was killed and three others, including a 13-year-old, were injured when masked gunmen attacked a wedding party in Goult, France. One of the attackers also died during the assault. The incident occurred as the newlyweds were leaving the party, with the assailants opening fire before fleeing on foot. Authorities have launched an investigation for murder and attempted murder by an organized gang, suspecting the violence may be linked to drug-related score-settling. Dozens of police and a helicopter have been mobilized to track down the gunmen in the village of Goult, located about 50 miles north of Marseille.</p>

          <p>Concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation following US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, particularly the possibility of Iran blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil chokepoint connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. In 2024 and early 2025, it facilitated over a quarter of global maritime oil trade, amounting to one-fifth of global oil consumption. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that any Iranian effort to block the strait would be "a suicidal move" that would likely trigger international backlash. The US, with its 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain, has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>

          <p>The US bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities represents President Trump's biggest gamble yet, with significant implications for his political reputation, the Middle East, and the concept of military intervention. Success could empower Trump and diminish Iran's global influence, but failure could lead to a protracted conflict and further destabilize the region. European leaders and diplomats privately hope for failure, fearing Trump's methods are perilous and breach international law. China and Russia will also be closely watching the situation, with Gulf states expressing outrage at Trump's intervention and fearing being dragged into a war. The best-case scenario involves Iran settling for a symbolic retaliation and resuming negotiations over a new nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the US is ready to meet with Iran following the bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, emphasizing that the US has no current plans for further attacks unless provoked. Rubio warned that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for Iran, affecting the global economy, particularly China. He reiterated that the US mission was designed to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions. Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie said the US would be able to clear the strait if Iran mined it, though it would disrupt world commerce temporarily.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the increasing trend of federal agents, particularly those from ICE, wearing masks, arguing that it undermines their authority and poses a danger to the public. The author contends that masking contradicts DHS guidelines and can provide cover for agents to violate civil rights. Recent incidents involving masked ICE agents have raised concerns about accountability and transparency. The author suggests that Congress should prohibit the use of masks by immigration agents to ensure accountability and prevent potential abuses of power.</p>

          <p>Following US military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, US leaders, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have warned Iran against retaliation. They suggested that Iran should engage diplomatically rather than choose to retaliate, emphasizing that the strikes were intentionally limited and not aimed at regime change. Trump stated that Iran must now make peace or face far greater consequences. US officials also indicated that the US was prepared for a potential response from Iran, and that any retaliation would be an incredibly poor choice.</p>

          <p>A rumor circulating online claimed that Iranian state TV announced a "great surprise" that the world would remember for centuries. The claim was widely shared on social media, with some news outlets reporting it as fact. However, major wire services did not report on the announcement, and the earliest record of the text appeared on an unaffiliated X account. The origin of the rumor suggests it is likely false, though definitive proof is lacking, and Snopes has contacted Iranian officials for clarification.

          <p>Tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast are facing dangerously hot temperatures as a rare June heatwave continues to grip parts of the US. Most of the northeastern quadrant of the country is under some type of heat advisory, with heat indices expected to top 100F in many areas. Cities are opening cooling centers and offering resources to help residents cope with the heat. Meteorologists attribute the extreme temperatures to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that traps heat and humidity.</p>
