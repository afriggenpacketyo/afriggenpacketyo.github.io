          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 12:32:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening earlier in the year, the growth of single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, potentially indicating that landlords are adjusting to consumer financial struggles. The annual increase of 2.3% has fallen below the pre-pandemic average, with markets like Miami showing no growth at all, a stark contrast to the pandemic-era boom. While Chicago still leads major metropolitan areas in rent increases due to tight inventory, the overall trend suggests a cooling market across various price tiers. This slowdown may impact the strategies of single-family rental REITs, which had been expanding to meet high demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., made an announcement cautioning pregnant women against Tylenol and linking vaccines to autism, distorting scientific findings. Researchers, including an epidemiologist whose work was cited, expressed alarm, stating the claims are misleading and could endanger public health by discouraging safe pain relief and vaccination. Experts from the CDC were reportedly not consulted for the announcement, which they found highly unusual. The scientific community worries these statements will undermine credible research and cause public harm through a backlash against established medical guidance.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced its plan to close all 19 of its till-free Amazon Fresh grocery stores across the United Kingdom, less than five years after their initial launch. The company stated it will pivot its focus towards its online grocery delivery services, which include partnerships with major UK supermarkets like Morrisons and Co-op. While the closures will impact approximately 250 staff members who are now in a consultation process, Amazon plans to convert five of the closed locations into Whole Foods stores. This move is part of a broader business evaluation that prioritizes the substantial growth opportunities in online delivery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young adults are engaging in high-risk financial behaviors, a trend dubbed "financial nihilism," driven by the feeling that traditional paths to wealth like homeownership are unattainable. This sentiment is fueling interest in speculative investments such as meme stocks, cryptocurrency, and sports betting as they seek rapid, high-reward outcomes. Faced with soaring housing costs, student debt, and a tight job market, many in Gen Z feel excluded from the conventional economy and are "swinging for the fences" out of a perceived necessity. While some see it as a temporary strategy, it reflects deep-seated anxiety about their financial future.</p>

          <p>In an hour-long address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump harshly criticized the international body and various world leaders, while promoting his administration's achievements. He accused the UN of being ineffective, stating it produces only "empty words" and fails to live up to its potential in resolving global conflicts. Trump also targeted other nations on issues ranging from migration, which he claimed is ruining countries, to climate change, which he called a "green scam."

          <p>A legal expert has stated that the expressed forgiveness from Erika Kirk towards her husband's suspected murderer is unlikely to prevent prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. Cully Stimson, a former prosecutor who has tried sexual assault cases, explained that while the defense may use the widow's grace as an argument for leniency, the case is prosecuted by the State of Utah, not the victim's family. The state is only required to consider the victim's family's views, not follow them, in its pursuit of justice. This article also notes that Utah is one of several states that still permits the firing squad as a method of execution.</p>

          <p>Americans are expected to face higher energy bills this winter, with the average cost to heat a home predicted to rise by 7.6% to $976, according to a new study. Households relying on natural gas could see an 8.4% increase, while those using electricity may face a 10.2% jump in costs, continuing a trend of escalating energy prices. These increases follow a costly summer for air-conditioning and are attributed to factors like grid maintenance, rising natural gas prices, and increased electricity demand. As a result, the number of American households falling behind on their utility bills has grown, compounding existing financial pressures from inflation and household debt.</p>

Agencies from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia issued statements reaffirming the drug's safety for pregnant women, citing a lack of new evidence to warrant a change in recommendations. International health experts emphasized that robust scientific studies, including a major Swedish study of 2.5 million children, show no causal link between paracetamol and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Amid widespread frustration with an aging political establishment in both parties, progressive figures like AOC are gaining traction, with polls showing Democratic voters favoring them over establishment leaders. The article notes that while AOC entered politics as an unapologetically left-wing figure, some critics on the left feel she has since shifted toward the center. Despite this, the author argues that her charisma and fighting spirit make her a formidable candidate to lead the Democratic party out of the current political landscape.</p>

          <p>During his wide-ranging speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump took a moment to mock the UN headquarters and recount his failed bid to renovate the building years ago. He told world leaders that as a real estate developer, he had offered to rebuild the complex for $500 million, promising superior materials like marble and mahogany, but was rejected for a more expensive and "far inferior" plan. This personal anecdote was part of a broader critique of the organization's effectiveness, which he also highlighted by joking about a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter upon his arrival.

This is about $210 less per month compared to the payments at the start of the year when rates were above 7%, saving a borrower over $75,000 in total interest over the life of the loan.

          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," Jim Cramer indicated he is considering taking profits on one of the Investing Club's bank stock holdings as the sector experiences a significant rally. Shares of major banks like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have been trending higher, driven by the expectation of continued interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Portfolio director Jeff Marks noted that while megacap tech stocks have been driving overall market gains, the average stock has not performed as well, keeping the S&P 500 in a balanced, non-overbought state. The discussion highlighted the strategy of managing winning positions in a strong market environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant show of support as many other establishment Democrats have remained silent. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, won the Democratic primary but has faced resistance from party leaders like Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries due to his progressive policies and critical stance on Israel. Despite this internal party friction, polls show Mamdani with a commanding lead over his opponents. Harris's endorsement signals a belief that the party should unite behind its nominee, even as it highlights the ongoing ideological divisions within the Democratic ranks.</p>

          <p>Israeli authorities have informed Palestinian and Jordanian officials of their decision to indefinitely close the Allenby Bridge crossing, the only international gateway for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank that does not pass through Israel.

The bridge had been temporarily shut down and reopened multiple times since the attack.

          <p>A satirical opinion piece critiques the handling of a case involving former border czar Tom Homan, who was allegedly recorded in an FBI sting operation accepting $50,000 in cash in a CAVA bag. The case was later dropped by the Trump administration, with FBI Director Kash Patel stating there was "no evidence of wrongdoing." The author humorously suggests that if bribery is an accepted language for influencing Trump administration officials, then perhaps taxpayers should start using their own money to bribe officials to act in the national interest. The piece uses sarcasm to highlight perceived corruption and the idea that money is the primary way to achieve policy goals within the administration.</p>

Harris claims she was sidelined and given "impossible, shit jobs," and that President Biden's staff operated with a "zero-sum" mentality, fearing her success would dim his. The book recounts her private concerns about Biden's fitness to run for re-election, calling the decision "recklessness," and describes his team's denial after his poor debate performance. Harris also admits to her own campaign errors, such as her infamous "not a thing comes to mind" comment when asked about policy differences with Biden.</p>

          <p>It has been nearly 30 years since a German footballer, Matthias Sammer in 1996, won the Ballon d'Or, the sport's top individual honor. An analysis suggests several reasons for this drought, despite Germany's continued success at the club and national levels. One key factor is that the award has overwhelmingly favored attacking players, and Germany has not produced strikers on par with historical legends like Gerd Müller. Furthermore, the era was dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who won the award almost exclusively for 15 years. With their dominance waning, there is hope for young German talents like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz to contend for the prize.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's newly implemented $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications is causing significant confusion and uncertainty for immigrant workers and their employers. Immigration attorneys report that while the White House has clarified the one-time fee applies only to initial applications and not to current visa holders or renewals, gray areas remain. There are concerns about whether current H-1B holders who travel abroad while an extension or change of employer is pending could be subject to the fee upon re-entry. The steep cost is expected to have a "chilling effect," deterring companies from hiring skilled foreign workers, which aligns with the administration's stated goal of prioritizing American labor.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has lost its bid to appeal a High Court injunction that temporarily blocked the removal of an Eritrean asylum seeker to France. The man was set to be one of the first individuals sent back under a new "one in, one out" agreement, but his lawyers secured a last-minute order to allow him time to pursue a modern slavery claim. The Court of Appeal upheld the injunction, noting it was granted because Home Office officials had themselves advised the man he would not have to pursue his case from France. This ruling pertains to the specific circumstances of this case and does not invalidate the broader UK-France returns agreement itself.</p>
