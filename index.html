        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A baby has died from whooping cough in the United Kingdom, marking the first fatal case of the infection this year, after the infant's mother was not vaccinated during pregnancy. Health officials are emphasizing this tragic event to underscore the critical importance of maternal vaccination, which provides passive immunity to newborns before they can receive their own immunizations. The death occurs amid broader concerns about falling childhood vaccine uptake for diseases like measles, prompting urgent calls for adherence to recommended schedules to prevent further avoidable deaths.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity for matcha, driven by its reputation as a health superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has created significant supply shortages and price hikes, even in its native Japan. Japanese tea producers are struggling to meet the intense demand due to an aging agricultural workforce and the highly labor-intensive process of growing tencha, the specific tea leaves used for matcha. Consequently, many retailers are rationing their stock, and some are beginning to explore promoting other traditional Japanese teas, like hojicha, as potential alternatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's education secretary has issued a stark warning to parents about the importance of school attendance during the first week of the new term, citing new data that reveals a strong link between early absences and long-term absenteeism. The figures show that over half of the students who missed some school in the first week of 2024 went on to become "persistently absent," a rate significantly higher than for pupils who attended fully. This alert comes as educational institutions continue to face attendance challenges that have not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's administration is ordering the removal of hundreds of "non-standard" crosswalks and street art installations across the state, framing the move as an effort to keep transportation facilities free of political ideologies. The policy has targeted rainbow-colored Pride crosswalks, memorials to victims of violence, and even student-designed safety art at schools that had previously won state recognition. While the state cites safety concerns, critics and affected municipalities decry the directive as a politically motivated attack on free speech, local governance, and the LGBTQ+ community, with several cities vowing legal challenges.</p>

The satellites, each weighing less than 100 grams, were launched aboard a Kinetica-1 rocket and represent Mexico's first commercial mission to low Earth orbit. CAS Space hailed the mission as a significant milestone for China's entry into the North American launch market, demonstrating its ability to offer a cost-effective and reliable service for international clients, including those in close proximity to the United States.</p>

          <p>The FBI is actively investigating a series of coordinated "swatting" incidents that have terrorized numerous U.S. college campuses with false reports of active shooters, causing widespread panic and prompting massive law enforcement responses. Although all the threats were ultimately determined to be hoaxes, they resulted in campus-wide lockdowns and stressful evacuations, showcasing the highly disruptive and dangerous nature of these crimes. Law enforcement officials stress that every threat must be treated as genuine, which depletes valuable resources and inflicts a lasting psychological toll on students, faculty, and their families.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively working to restore Confederate monuments and names at U.S. military installations, reversing actions taken by the previous administration. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the return of a controversial Confederate memorial to Arlington National Cemetery, while a portrait of Robert E. Lee is being returned to West Point. The author, a U.S. Army veteran, critiques these moves as a glorification of a treasonous cause, arguing that one can honor ancestral sacrifice without revering the unjust ideologies for which they fought, drawing a parallel to his own grandfather who fought for Mussolini's army.</p>

          <p>The deployment of U.S. warships to the Caribbean has heightened anxiety among Venezuelans, who are already grappling with a prolonged crisis of hyperinflation, shortages, and authoritarian rule. While the Trump administration has sent mixed signals—imposing sanctions while also engaging in diplomatic talks—the military presence has fueled rumors of intervention and placed the population on edge. Many citizens express a sense of exhaustion and resignation, trying to maintain normalcy in their daily lives while feeling that the country's fate is being decided by external forces, creating an atmosphere of fear and cautious hope.</p>

          <p>Despite public opinion polls showing the Democratic Party's standing at a 30-year low, some strategists see reasons for optimism and a potential recovery. The party's chances in upcoming congressional elections appear to be improving, and potential presidential candidates are actively campaigning against President Trump, whose own popularity is also declining. Strategists suggest a recovery plan focused on rallying public opposition to Trump, addressing economic concerns like affordability, and organizing for midterm elections. The internal debate over policy and messaging is seen by some as a necessary step to reconnect with voters.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism, proposing that its deep roots in American racism offer a vital lens for understanding and combating contemporary authoritarian movements. The author argues that rather than solely drawing parallels to European history, society should recognize the long-standing "racial fascism" that Black Americans have historically fought through belief, diverse forms of resistance, and faith. This enduring legacy of struggle, from civil disobedience to cultural expression, provides a powerful and proven model for defending democratic ideals against deeply embedded threats.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has announced it will not grant a visa to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, preventing him from attending the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in New York. The decision, which also affects approximately 80 other Palestinian officials, effectively blocks Abbas from a key diplomatic event where several U.S. allies are expected to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. The State Department justified the move by citing the Palestinian Authority's failure to renounce extremism, while Abbas's office condemned it as a violation of the UN headquarters agreement, drawing criticism from European leaders.</p>

Experts note that while air conditioning can improve well-being during heatwaves, it contributes to climate change and can be expensive.

The research focuses on using rugged seamounts to create "acoustic shadow zones," areas where sonar is ineffective, to conceal intelligent sea mines. By placing these weapons in locations where sound waves are fractured or absorbed, they could evade detection and be used to selectively target enemy vessels. This strategy is presented as a method to enhance maritime security and potentially challenge U.S. naval dominance in the region.</p>

This week, key economic data releases, including European inflation and U.S. non-farm payrolls, will be closely monitored for signs of the market's direction heading into the fall season.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing with immigrant parents who emphasized the value of money. The 30-year-old founder of Passes and co-founder of Scale AI began her business ventures on the elementary school playground, trading and selling items like Pokémon cards and colored pencils. Her hustles evolved online with the game Neopets and eventually led her to drop out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, a decision that initially disappointed her parents but ultimately set her on a path to immense success.</p>

          <p>Chelsea and England defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the "best decision I have ever made," citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical health. After a grueling season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright realized she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not perform at her best. The 32-year-old, who has since undergone knee surgery and started counseling, says she now feels "back to life" and is in a much better place ahead of the new Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>Nottinghamshire's Reform-led county council has banned journalists from the Nottingham Post and affiliated BBC reporters, a move critics compare to the anti-press tactics of Donald Trump. The council justified the ban by accusing the paper of spreading "misinformation," while the newspaper's editor called it an "attack on local democracy." This incident is part of a broader trend where some hard-right politicians on both sides of the Atlantic appear to be shunning traditional media engagement, possibly believing they can benefit electorally by creating a foil and communicating directly with supporters through other channels.</p>

          <p>Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley with a stoppage-time penalty, but the win failed to mask persistent issues with the team's goalkeepers. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the problem after another costly error, this time from Altay Bayindir, which followed similar mistakes in previous matches. The club is reportedly in talks to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens before the transfer deadline. The narrow win provides temporary relief but highlights the urgent need for stability in a key position as the team prepares for a difficult stretch of upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football season began with a disappointing 43-10 blowout loss to Utah at the Rose Bowl, exposing significant weaknesses on both sides of the ball. The Bruins' defense struggled with missed tackles and failed to pressure Utah's quarterback, who dominated the game through the air and on the ground, helping his team convert 14 of 17 third downs. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had limited success, and the running game was largely ineffective. The lopsided defeat raises early questions about the team's competitiveness after a preseason where practices were largely shielded from public view.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists with the USDA are using drones equipped with loudspeakers to scare gray wolves away from cattle in Northern California and Oregon. The drones blast a variety of sounds, including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices, to haze the predators and interrupt potential attacks on livestock. This nonlethal method is being tested as wolf populations recover and conflicts with ranchers increase. While the technology is expensive and its long-term effectiveness is still unknown, early results show success in deterring wolves without harming them.</p>

          <p>German basketball player Dennis Schröder was targeted with racist abuse during his team's EuroBasket championship victory over Lithuania. Schröder reported hearing monkey noises from the Lithuanian fan section as the teams left the court at halftime, calling the behavior unacceptable and stating that racism has no place in the sport. The German Basketball Federation condemned the incident, and FIBA, the sport's governing body, has referred video evidence to local authorities in Finland, where the game was held.

          <p>Germany is marking the 10-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), made as the country opened its borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, and its legacy remains a topic of intense national debate. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave were employed by 2022, challenges with integration and unemployment persist. The anniversary prompts a look back at the successes and failures of Germany's approach to migration over the past decade.</p>

          <p>Police in West Drayton, London, arrested five people after a group of masked men damaged fences and attempted to enter a hotel housing asylum seekers. The incident was part of a day of demonstrations across England and Scotland, where anti-asylum groups and counter-protesters gathered near hotels used for migrant accommodation. In London, approximately 500 protesters were present, and police enforced cordons and a dispersal order to prevent further disorder. The protests highlight the ongoing tensions in the UK surrounding the government's policy of housing asylum seekers in local hotels.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old road worker in Florida was killed when a pickup truck towing a boat crashed into the specialized safety vehicle he was operating. The victim was driving a "Scorpion Crash Truck," a vehicle explicitly designed with a large, collapsible cushion to absorb impacts and protect highway crews during roadside operations like line painting. The severe collision, which occurred on I-75 in Broward County, tragically pushed the safety truck into another work vehicle, resulting in the driver's fatal injuries.
