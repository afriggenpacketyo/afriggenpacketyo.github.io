          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 21:19:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has led to mandatory evacuations for residents in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township, threatening over 1,300 structures and displacing 3,000 people. The fire, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area and is under investigation, has already consumed approximately 3,200 acres and is only 5% contained. The blaze has also caused major traffic disruptions, including the closure of the Garden State Parkway and several local routes, and resulted in power outages for over 25,000 customers due to the de-energization of power lines for safety. Officials are actively combating the fire with helicopters and planes dropping water, and have reminded people not to fly drones in the fire zones.</p>

          <p>With the Real ID deadline less than a month away, a CBS News analysis reveals that many states are not fully compliant, potentially causing significant disruptions at airport security checkpoints. As of mid-April, at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant, with New Jersey having the lowest rate at 17%. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, requires individuals to have enhanced identification to pass through airport security or enter federal buildings, and the TSA plans to implement additional screening for those with non-compliant IDs. Travelers with legacy IDs should arrive at least three hours before their flight, and failure to verify identity through secondary screening will result in denial of entry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The L.A. Zoo will temporarily suspend its elephant program, relocating its two remaining elephants, Billy and Tina, to the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma, where they will join a larger herd. This decision comes after decades of criticism from animal rights advocates regarding the zoo's enclosure size and the health challenges faced by its elephants. While the zoo defends its care, animal welfare organizations argue that the elephants would be better off in a sanctuary with more space, citing concerns about Billy's repetitive behavior and Tina's health issues. The move aims to provide Billy and Tina with better social interaction opportunities, though some advocates would have preferred a sanctuary setting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China faces a nationwide decline in birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, stands out for its relatively high birth rate, driven by strong cultural traditions that value large families and lineage. In 2024, Guangdong recorded 1.13 million births, making it the top province for new births in China for the seventh consecutive year. The province's birth rate of 8.89 per thousand people is among the highest in the country, contrasting with the reluctance of youth elsewhere in China to have children. The preference for sons to carry on the family name remains a significant factor in the region's higher fertility rates.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The FDA will work with food companies to eliminate these petroleum-based dyes, including Citrus Red No. 2, Orange B, Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, and Blue No. 2. The plan is contingent on cooperation from major food companies, and the FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives as alternatives, with some industry groups questioning the proposed timeline.</p>

          <p>Today's newspaper headlines are dominated by reports of a proposed peace deal for Ukraine, the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, and the death of Pope Francis. The Daily Telegraph reports that Trump's peace deal would allow Putin to retain most of the seized Ukrainian territory, while the Financial Times notes pressure on Kyiv to concede for Trump's victory claim. The Guardian highlights the IMF's assessment that Trump's tariffs have caused a "major negative shock" to the global economy, and the Daily Mail focuses on Prime Minister Badenoch's call for Keir Starmer to apologize to women over the biological sex ruling.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urging coordinated action against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, according to Japanese government sources. The letter, delivered by Chinese Ambassador Wu Jianghao, likely calls for Japan to join China in opposing protectionism. However, Japan, a close U.S. ally, is expected to respond cautiously to the proposal. This comes as Japan is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over the higher levies imposed by Washington.</p>

In a statement, Owens explained that he would not be allowed to run the show as he always has, making independent decisions based on what was right for "60 Minutes" and its audience, leading him to step aside so the show can move forward.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court seems inclined to require a Maryland school board to allow parents to opt their elementary school children out of instruction featuring storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether public schools infringe upon parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom by requiring children to participate in instruction that violates their religious beliefs. Several justices expressed skepticism about the school board's refusal to allow opt-outs, questioning why it was not feasible to accommodate parents' religious objections, while others raised concerns about the potential impact on public education if parents could selectively exempt their children from curricular requirements.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a miss on both revenue and earnings per share in its first-quarter report, with automotive revenue plummeting 20% year-over-year. The company cited the need to update lines at its vehicle factories for the Model Y refresh and lower average selling prices as reasons for the decline. Net income also plummeted 71% to $409 million, and Tesla refrained from promising growth this year, with CEO Elon Musk spending significant time in the Trump White House overseeing an effort to downsize the federal government. The president's tariffs plan has raised concerns about increased costs for essential electric vehicle components.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists are increasingly puzzled by a medieval cemetery near Cardiff Airport, as new findings contradict previous understandings. Initially discovered last year, the site, dating to the 6th or 7th century, contains skeletons buried in unusual positions with unexpected artifacts. Researchers have now learned that nearly all the burials are women, and while their bones show signs of heavy manual labor, there are also indications of wealth and luxury. The discovery of a woman tossed in a ditch, contrasting with the careful burials of others, further complicates the picture.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering two of her children, has been found guilty of conspiring with her brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Daybell, representing herself, maintained her brother acted in self-defense, but prosecutors argued the shooting was a ploy to collect Vallow's life insurance and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The jury found her guilty, citing text messages that invoked religious beliefs to justify the murder, and she now faces another trial for allegedly conspiring to murder her niece's ex-husband. Three jurors cited the text message evidence as particularly impactful in their deliberations.</p>
