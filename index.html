          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to take effect on August 1. This move escalates trade tensions, with President Trump citing Canada's retaliatory duties and the cross-border flow of fentanyl as key reasons for the new levy. The tariff is separate from existing sectoral duties on items like steel and aluminum, and the administration has warned of further increases if Canada responds with its own countermeasures. These actions come amid ongoing, strained trade negotiations between the two closely linked economic partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant confrontation occurred between protesters and U.S. Border Patrol agents at a farm in Ventura County, California, during an immigration enforcement operation. Federal agents, who stated they were serving a warrant at a marijuana facility, used tear gas and less-lethal rounds to disperse the crowd. The clash resulted in several injuries and drew sharp criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who condemned the "militaristic raids." The event highlights the escalating tensions surrounding the Trump administration's immigration policies and their impact on local communities.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a celebrated IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) after 60 years of membership. His decision is a protest against the planned five-day strike by resident doctors in the UK over a pay dispute with the government. Lord Winston expressed strong concerns that the strike action is inappropriate while the country is struggling and could erode public trust in the medical profession. The BMA maintains that the strike is necessary as the government has refused to negotiate on pay restoration.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and key student negotiator during pro-Palestinian campus protests, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration. The action alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress stemming from his three-month detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident, was targeted for deportation under a rarely used provision related to foreign policy risks. The Department of Homeland Security defended its actions, stating Khalil's rhetoric "terrorized Jewish students," a claim his representatives deny.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. The California Board of Parole Hearings made the decision after hearing opposition from prosecutors and testimony from victims' families regarding the string of murders that terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., impersonated police officers to lure, sexually assault, and murder at least 10 women. Bianchi, now 74, will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years.</p>

          <p>A massive Martian meteorite, the largest piece of Mars on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated value of up to $4 million. The meteorite, named NWA 16788, weighs over 54 pounds and represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. The rare object offers a significant opportunity for scientific study into the geology and history of the red planet.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed at least 15 civilians, including 10 children, who were waiting outside a health clinic run by the U.S. charity Project HOPE. The organization condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, stating the victims were gathered to receive treatment for malnutrition and other illnesses. The Israel Defense Forces claimed the strike targeted a "terrorist" but said it was investigating the incident and regretted any harm to civilians. The tragedy occurred as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated in Washington, appeared to have stalled.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made a remarkable and unlikely fossil discovery directly on its own property. A vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago was found in a narrow core sample drilled over 750 feet deep under the museum's parking lot. The drilling was part of a study for geothermal heating potential, making the find incredibly serendipitous. Museum officials described the odds of such a discovery as "astronomically small" and have put the hockey-puck-shaped fossil on display for the public.</p>

President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance on social media, linking it to his tariff policies.

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, citing political reasons in addition to trade concerns. In a letter to Brazil's president, President Trump explicitly condemned the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, calling it a "Witch Hunt," and linked the tariff to "insidious attacks on Free Elections." The move relies on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same authority used for other recent tariffs that is currently facing a legal challenge. Critics have accused the administration of abusing its power for political purposes. (not investment advice)</p>

The return of the iconic landmark was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display in the Montmartre district. The original sails collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, but new aluminum blades were installed last summer. However, delays with a new motor meant the wings remained motionless until now, just in time for a busy tourist season.</p>

The court noted the grave nature of the crime, in which the defendants took advantage of a victim who was unable to resist. The scandal led to Taeil's removal from the group in August 2024.</p>

He identifies eight key "emotional shortcut" words—such as people, better, change, and together—that consistently resonate with voters across cultures and political divides. While not a guarantee of victory, these words serve as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging. The article explores examples like "Get Brexit Done" and "Make America Great Again," and considers how AI might change the future of political messaging.</p>

He expressed concern that the internet, social media, and artificial intelligence are making society less creative and more controlled, turning people into "dumbed down machines." Welsh fears a future where machine intelligence leads to a "post-art, post-culture society." He also reflected on the 1990s, the era his new book is set in, suggesting it was a time when people "had lives" before the internet became a dominant, "controlling force."</p>

The piece argues that the world is witnessing a familiar cycle of unimaginable suffering and international inaction.

The move signals Tesla's intent to expand its autonomous vehicle operations beyond its initial pilot program in Austin, Texas. The company's approach, which primarily relies on cameras rather than more expensive sensors like lidar, is now being tested in real-world environments. This expansion comes as Tesla's initial efforts in Austin have faced some public setbacks and regulatory scrutiny from federal safety agencies.</p>
