          <p>General Motors has revised its 2025 earnings guidance, anticipating a $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's auto tariffs; however, this new guidance also considers the recent adjustments to some tariffs, including reimbursements for certain U.S. parts and reduced tariff stacking. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to offset the increased costs by strengthening the supply base and increasing the sourcing of U.S. parts by 27% since 2019. The company aims to leverage its existing manufacturing footprint to add capacity efficiently, but Barra declined to comment on shifting production from Mexico to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro; Mounjaro revenue reached $3.84 billion, up 113% year-over-year, while Zepbound sales hit $2.31 billion, quadrupling from the previous year. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to a $1.57 billion charge related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing drugmakers to invest in U.S. manufacturing, advocating for permanent lower tax rates in the U.S. to further encourage domestic production.</p>

          <p>Meta has cautioned that European users may face a "materially worse" experience following a European Commission decision that its "consent or pay" model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The company anticipates that modifications to comply with the DMA could significantly impact its European business and revenue, potentially beginning in the third quarter of this year. Analyst Eric Seufert suggests Meta may be strategically trying to mobilize European users to oppose the regulatory clampdown. The Commission argues that Meta's model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used, and Meta faces further fines if it does not comply within 60 days.</p>

CEO David Joyner stated that CVS planned and budgeted for elevated medical cost trends, mitigating surprises in their financial results. Joyner also mentioned that CVS is monitoring the potential impact of President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., noting that most retail products are sourced domestically.</p>

Analysts suggest that this deal could solidify President Trump's interest in Ukraine, as his administration is now publicly invested in the country's future.

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has implemented several policies that significantly benefit the U.S. meat industry, including speeding up slaughter lines, rolling back food safety measures, and gutting the USDA’s animal welfare research department. These actions have raised concerns among labor and animal advocates, who argue that they endanger slaughterhouse workers and negatively impact animal welfare. Additionally, the administration has allowed JBS, the world’s largest meat company with a history of scandals, to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. While tariffs have hurt some agricultural exports, the Trump administration has largely adopted an anti-regulation stance that favors the meat industry at the expense of the environment and consumers.</p>

While the BOJ maintained its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent, it now expects to stably achieve its 2 percent inflation target in the latter half of the three years through March 2028, a year later than previously forecasted.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term is marked by a pattern of errors and incompetence, referred to as "rule by error," where mistakes are either hidden behind authoritarianism or used to walk back unpopular policies. Examples include mistakenly sending a letter to Harvard University detailing extreme actions to avoid federal grant freezes, and the deportation of an Salvadorian man despite a deportation protection order. The administration continues to defy courts and double down on its failures, often prioritizing shooting the messenger over correcting mistakes.

However, experts caution that these private efforts cannot replicate the scope and public service provided by federal funding, and small projects cannot remotely match the retreat of federal government research. The NIH's budget has been significantly reduced, leading to the cancellation of grants and a slowdown in new approvals, affecting various areas of medicine.

          <p>Chelsea's summer signing, Sandy Baltimore, has had an impressive debut season, contributing significantly to the team's WSL title success. Despite playing as a forward at PSG, Baltimore adapted to a left wing-back position at Chelsea, making 14 appearances and contributing to four goals in her last four games. Her defensive responsibility and attacking ability have kept England left-back Niamh Charles out of the team. Coach Bompastor praised Baltimore's consistency and ability to create opportunities in the box.</p>

          <p>Wang Shouwen, China's former vice-minister of commerce and key trade negotiator during the first Trump administration, has transitioned to a less prominent role at the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC). This shift comes as Li Chenggang, China’s envoy to the World Trade Organization, replaces Wang amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump's renewed tariff policies. Wang's transfer to the ACFIC, operating under the Communist Party’s United Front Work Department, raises questions about his future career trajectory, as he remains several years from the typical retirement age for ministerial-level officials.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky Derby highlights how wealthy individuals finance their passion for horses, with the potential to earn millions; the winner of the 151st Kentucky Derby stands to gain $3.1 million from a $5 million purse. Bank of America's Steven Mason specializes in equestrian clients, noting that they view horses as both a lifestyle and potential investments. However, Mason cautions that horses, like other passion assets, are illiquid investments with uncertain returns. A growing number of entrepreneurs and hedge fund managers are entering the horse ownership arena, such as former hedge funder Jack Wolf, co-owner of Justify.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has seen a dramatic shift towards embracing cryptocurrency, with the industry celebrating what they call a "180 pivot" from the Biden years. Executive actions, strategic appointments, and early wins, such as the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the rollback of SEC enforcement tactics, have fostered a more welcoming environment for crypto in Washington, D.C. Jonathan Gould at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has signaled support for issuing new bank charters to crypto firms, while the new chair of the SEC, Paul Atkins, is working with crypto stakeholders to craft guidance on token issuance. However, the Federal Reserve remains a structural holdout, restricting banks from certain crypto-related activities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's shift towards supporting cryptocurrency has raised concerns about potential destabilization of the American financial system. Trump, once a crypto skeptic, now praises the crypto community and has family investments in crypto-related ventures. This change of opinion could lead to weakened regulations, a government-backed crypto reserve, and increased integration of crypto into mainstream banking. Critics worry that this could socialize risk, expose taxpayers to crypto-related losses, and create opportunities for corruption and market manipulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the Nazi era, sport was viewed as physical education aimed at promoting health and performance for a productive national economy and fitness for war, while individual sports were secondary to collective activities. The Nazis organized the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin to present themselves as a peace-loving, open state and demonstrate their strengths. While sports clubs and associations excluded Jews from professional and social life, purely Jewish sports clubs experienced a boom between 1933 and 1936. After the 1936 Olympic Games, the situation for Jews in Germany worsened, and Jewish sport was systematically destroyed.</p>

Moorcroft had warned of possible redundancies in March due to rising costs and falling sales, with energy expenses increasing significantly.

          <p>Ukraine signed a deal with the United States, granting the U.S. control over a share of its future revenue from natural resources, in exchange for creating a joint investment fund. This agreement, which came after months of fraught negotiations, aims to give President Trump a personal stake in the country’s fate and address his concerns about U.S. aid. The deal involves a U.S.-controlled fund receiving revenue from Ukraine’s natural resources, and it removes the condition that American aid given during the war be treated as debt. While the deal includes no security guarantee, it keeps the door open for Ukraine to join the European Union.</p>
