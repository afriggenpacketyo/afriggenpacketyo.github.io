          <p>The dietary supplement creatine, widely known for enhancing muscle growth and athletic performance, is now being recognized for a broader range of health benefits. Experts suggest it may support cognitive functions, improve memory, aid heart health by supplying energy, and slow aspects of aging by mitigating age-related muscle loss. While research is ongoing, studies indicate potential positive impacts on neurological health and bone strength, especially when combined with resistance training. Generally considered safe for most healthy individuals, creatine monohydrate is the most recommended and researched form of the popular supplement.</p>

          <p>According to BlackRock's Jay Jacobs, a significant trend in 2025 sees investors moving from traditional, broad technology sector funds to more targeted, thematic ETFs focused on artificial intelligence and blockchain. This shift reflects a desire for more granular exposure to high-growth areas within the tech ecosystem, from semiconductor manufacturing to decentralized technologies. Funds like BlackRock's AI-focused BAI and Ethereum-tracking ETHA have seen substantial inflows and performance gains, fueled by enthusiasm for AI's disruptive potential and new regulations bolstering confidence in digital assets. This targeted investment approach indicates a maturing strategy among those looking to capitalize on specific technological innovations. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights theaters like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas, which operates as a non-profit and hosts special events, and Vidiots in Los Angeles, which combines a theater with an extensive film archive. Another example, New York's Metrograph, thrives as a for-profit by offering a boutique experience with a bookstore, restaurant, and curated programming.

          <p>As part of a broader ceasefire agreement, Hamas is insisting that Israel include prominent Palestinian prisoners, such as Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat, in an upcoming prisoner exchange. Israel's justice ministry has published a list of 250 prisoners to be freed but has so far excluded these high-profile figures, who are viewed by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance. This disagreement could potentially complicate the timeline for the release of 20 Israeli hostages from Gaza. The exchange is a key component of the first phase of a U.S.-proposed deal to end the two-year war.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has proposed a ban that would prohibit Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace for flights to and from the United States. Analysts suggest this move, intended to level the playing field with U.S. carriers who already avoid the route, could significantly increase costs for Chinese airlines. If implemented, these carriers would face longer flight times, higher fuel consumption, and potential losses from canceling pre-sold tickets. The decision could force Chinese airlines to either absorb the increased expenses, raise ticket prices, or cancel the affected trans-Pacific routes altogether.</p>

This move is part of President Vladimir Putin's broader strategy to create a "sovereign" internet, reduce reliance on Western platforms like WhatsApp, and enhance state surveillance capabilities.

The policy would prioritize teachers in high-demand subjects like math and science, as well as those who can teach in the Welsh medium.

They are also seeking to suppress statements Mangione made to law enforcement and evidence found in his backpack, claiming his rights were violated during his arrest in Pennsylvania five days after the December shooting.</p>

          <p>This article posits that President Donald Trump increasingly models his political identity on the aggressive, no-holds-barred ethos of combat sports like mixed martial arts (MMA). By frequently appearing at UFC events and aligning himself with fighters, Trump cultivates an image of a dominant, rule-breaking brawler, a style that resonates with a specific voter demographic. The author argues this "MAGA-fication of sports" injects a brutish sensibility into public life and weakens collective adherence to norms and boundaries. This strategy is seen as a deliberate effort to turn political contests into brawls where traditional rules no longer apply.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author grapples with the concept of "disenfranchised grief" after the death of her grandmother. Living safely in the U.S. while witnessing the immense suffering and mass casualties in Gaza, she finds her personal sorrow feels indulgent and illegitimate in comparison. This internal conflict highlights the psychological burden carried by many in diasporas, where private mourning is overshadowed by public, collective trauma. The author explores how this immense scale of atrocity, made immediate by social media, reshapes the very nature of grief, making even the comfort of a family recipe feel like a betrayal.</p>

          <h2>Exploring How to Productively Engage with the Emotion of Regret</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 09:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores the psychological purpose of regret, framing it not as a purely negative emotion but as a potential tool for self-discovery. While looking back with regret can feel like a refusal to accept the past, the piece suggests that allowing oneself to experience these feelings can lead to valuable insights in the present. Instead of adhering to a "no regrets" philosophy, which can be a form of denial, engaging with what might have been can clarify one's current values and desires. This constructive approach can transform regret from a source of pain into a catalyst for personal growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The race to become the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is shaping up to be more than a simple election; it is being interpreted as a verdict on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership. The two main candidates, Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson, represent different approaches to the role, with Powell, who was recently sacked from the cabinet, positioning herself as a more independent voice. With many party members reportedly disgruntled with Starmer's performance and the party's falling poll numbers, the election of Powell could be seen as a rebuke to the current leadership's direction and inner circle.</p>

          <p>The world is on track to produce a record amount of grain this year, highlighting a long-term trend of agricultural abundance that has made famines far less common than in the past. Advances in farming technology, including improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation, have tripled cereal yields since the 1960s, creating a global food system with significant surplus. While this progress is a major human achievement, challenges remain, as billions still cannot afford a healthy diet. Today's famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict rather than crop failures.</p>

Djokovic, who had been struggling with physical issues throughout the tournament, received medical treatment for his back during the match but was unable to overcome his opponent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this analysis, President Trump and his allies are using the recent killing of rightwing influencer Charlie Kirk to justify broad attacks against political opponents. Historians and legal scholars argue this follows an "authoritarian playbook" by using a violent act as a pretext to target critics, including liberal donors like George Soros, media outlets, and Democratic leaders. The administration's rhetoric about an "enemy within" and moves to investigate non-profit organizations are seen as attempts to silence dissent and consolidate power. These actions are described as a dangerous escalation that undermines democratic norms and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military technology magazine has reported that the country's electronic warfare (EW) forces successfully tricked a foreign spy plane in the South China Sea. The report claims that an EW system was used to simulate the radar signals of a very large vessel, such as an aircraft carrier, from up to 300km away. This deception allegedly caused the foreign surveillance aircraft to be misled, potentially diverting it toward a false location or making it track a non-existent target. The account provides a rare public glimpse into China's developing electronic warfare capabilities and tactics in the contested region.</p>
