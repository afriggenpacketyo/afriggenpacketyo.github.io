          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump over 10% after reinstating its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a stabilization in travel bookings after a period of lower-than-expected demand. The carrier's third-quarter outlook surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express. While overall full-year earnings projections were revised downward from earlier, the renewed confidence and strategic focus on high-value travelers have provided a significant boost to investor sentiment.

          <p>Dispatch audio from Texas's Hill Country reveals that Kerr County officials waited 90 minutes to issue a CodeRED emergency alert after a firefighter requested it as floodwaters began to rise. This significant delay occurred despite the system's advertised capability to notify the entire county in minutes. By the time alerts were fully disseminated several hours later, hundreds of people had been swept away by the catastrophic flooding, raising serious questions about the county's emergency response protocols and prior decisions regarding its warning systems.</p>

          <p>This week, the full "buck moon" will be visible across the UK, appearing larger and with an orange hue due to its low position in the sky. This phenomenon is partly caused by a major lunar standstill, a celestial event that occurs every 18.6 years. The name originates from Native American traditions, marking the time of year when new antlers grow on buck deer, and it promises a spectacular sight for sky-gazers, especially on Thursday evening.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, arguing it is a critical material for national defense and domestic industry. However, economists and industry experts are warning that this move could trigger significant price increases for a wide range of consumer goods, including appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. The tariff could also raise costs for home repairs and maintaining the nation's electrical grid, leading to broader inflationary pressures across the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comparison of two recent major floods reveals starkly different outcomes based on community preparedness. While an unexpected deluge in Texas resulted in over 120 deaths, a similar event in Ruidoso, New Mexico, caused far less harm. Ruidoso's recent experience with devastating wildfires had made the area more vulnerable to flooding from "burn scars," but it also meant that local officials and residents were acutely aware of the risk and had plans in place, demonstrating how recent experience can significantly inform emergency response.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic floods in Texas, where it's estimated only 2.5% of homeowners in hard-hit Kerr County had flood coverage, serve as a stark reminder of a nationwide risk. Experts emphasize that standard homeowners insurance policies typically exclude flood damage, a critical detail for residents across the country. With 99% of U.S. counties having experienced a flood event in the past two decades, obtaining separate flood insurance is a crucial step for financial protection against such disasters.

          <h2>Republican Spending Bill Allocates Billions in New Funding for ICE Detention and Enforcement</h2>

          <p>A recently passed Republican spending bill provides a massive infusion of cash to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, allocating nearly $75 billion over four years for detention and enforcement. This funding will allow ICE to more than double its detention capacity from 41,500 to 116,000 beds. Civil liberties advocates worry this will enable the Trump administration to implement its aggressive immigration tactics on a grander scale, potentially undermining due process and fundamental American values.</p>

          <p>An analysis of ranked-choice voting (RCV) suggests its implementation in California could reshape the state's political dynamics, similar to its effects in New York City. Advocates believe RCV could lower election costs by eliminating runoffs, encourage more civil campaigning, and potentially increase the viability of candidates from outside the dominant political party. By allowing voters to rank preferences, the system could alter campaign strategies and lead to more representative outcomes in both local and statewide races.</p>
