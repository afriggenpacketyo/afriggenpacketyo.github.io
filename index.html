          <h2>Trump's Tariffs Face Legal Challenge from Small Businesses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 14:30:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small businesses are challenging President Trump's tariffs in federal court, arguing they represent an unlawful expansion of executive power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Jeffrey Schwab, representing the plaintiffs, contends that trade deficits, a long-standing issue, do not constitute a national emergency justifying unilateral tariffs. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that Congress permits the president to impose them and that invoking a national emergency broadens his authority. At least six lawsuits have targeted Trump's tariffs, with this case marking the first time a federal court has heard a challenge to their legality.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is blocking Department of Justice nominations in protest of President Trump's plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar.

The controversy stems from legal and ethical questions surrounding the acceptance of a foreign gift for use as Air Force One. While Republicans hold the Senate majority, Schumer's action could slow down the confirmation process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on over 20 companies allegedly involved in a network facilitating the shipment of Iranian oil to China.

The sanctioned companies include CCIC Singapore PTE and Huangdao Inspection and Certification Co, accused of concealing the oil's Iranian origins.

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with their bill to fund President Trump’s agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts, despite internal disputes. The plan proposes imposing work requirements for recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. While the bill avoids some of the more drastic cuts sought by hardliners, it faces opposition from both conservatives and moderate Republicans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $715 billion but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is reducing its workforce by 3%, impacting about 6,000 employees across the board. The layoffs will focus on reducing management levels to enhance efficiency, the company said in a statement. Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood mentioned the company's focus on streamlining and reducing layers with fewer managers. The tech giant reported strong sales and profits in a recent quarterly earnings report, with revenues up 13% from the same period last year. The company's last major workforce reduction was in 2023, when it cut 11,000 workers.</p>

          <p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced he will obstruct Trump administration Justice Department nominations until the White House provides answers about accepting a luxury aircraft from Qatar. Schumer called the proposed arrangement “not just naked corruption,” and questioned its compliance with the emoluments clause. The opposition to accepting the plane extends beyond party lines, with some Republicans also raising concerns about espionage and national security. The White House accused Democratic leadership of “prioritizing politics over critical DOJ appointments.”</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary reduction in tariffs between the United States and China, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty about the final level of tariffs. While stock prices have risen, the Federal Reserve is in a wait-and-see mode, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effect of the tariffs is known. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies remains significantly lower than its peak, indicating ongoing economic concerns. Analysts suggest that the worst of the trade war may have passed, but the U.S. economy is not yet out of the woods.</p>
