        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic legislators have introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2025. The bill aims to make excessive price hikes by large corporations illegal, granting enforcement power to the FTC and state attorneys general, particularly in response to market shocks like President Trump's tariff policies. Companies with over $100 million in revenue would face new disclosure requirements for price increases, while an additional $1 billion would fund the FTC for enforcement. The proposal has garnered support from labor unions but faces significant political and industry opposition, making its passage uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent release of court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein has renewed public interest in the source of his vast wealth. The disgraced financier, who died by suicide in 2019 with a net worth of around $560 million, accumulated his fortune primarily through money management for billionaires like Les Wexner and Leon Black. Despite never graduating from college, his career began at Bear Stearns and evolved into a lucrative advisory role. Major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, also played a significant role in his financial dealings, later settling lawsuits for their involvement.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinning drug, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount. This direct-to-consumer model, operating through their Eliquis 360 support program, allows the companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers. Analysts believe this move will not negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated, and it may curry favor with the Trump administration amid concerns over drug prices. The move is seen as a strategic response to impending generic competition for the medication in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation by Fox News Digital has uncovered a private online forum where judges and members of the Environmental Law Institute's Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) discussed climate-related litigation and shared resources. The forum, which operated from 2022 to 2024, included messages where judges and CJP staff exchanged information on climate science and legal cases. Critics, such as Senator Ted Cruz, argue that such collaborations could compromise judicial impartiality by "indoctrinating" judges. The CJP maintains it provides neutral, objective information, but the discovery has intensified concerns about potential activist influence within the judiciary.</p>

She was a top-charting artist before the Beatles' era, with hits including "Who's Sorry Now?" and "Don't Break the Heart That Loves You." Her life was marked by both immense professional success and profound personal tragedy, including a violent sexual assault in 1974 that she said destroyed her marriage. After the attack, she also endured the murder of her brother and battled mental health issues, yet her music has seen a recent resurgence on social media.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, with some Republican support, has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local governments to access federal FEMA funding for relief and preparation efforts, such as cooling centers and heat adaptation projects. The proposal follows a deadly June heat dome and highlights that extreme heat, the leading cause of weather-related deaths, is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster. While some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue existing rules could cover heat waves, the bill aims to formalize the process for providing aid.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections, a move intended to boost democratic engagement among young people. The proposal has ignited a debate over its potential political ramifications, with critics claiming it is designed to benefit the Labour Party, which polls strongly with younger demographics. However, polling data for 16- and 17-year-olds is limited, and their overall impact on election outcomes is projected to be small due to their relatively small population size and historically lower turnout rates. The fracturing political landscape could also see their votes split among various parties.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has suspended MP Diane Abbott pending an investigation into comments she made about racism. In a recent BBC interview, Abbott reiterated her controversial view that racism against Black people is distinct from prejudice experienced by Jewish and Traveller communities, as it is based on visible skin color. This stance echoes a 2023 letter that led to a previous year-long suspension. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner expressed disappointment with the comments, stating there is no place for antisemitism in the party. Abbott will now sit as an independent MP while the investigation proceeds.</p>

          <p>A survey from the National Association of Home Builders reveals that U.S. homebuilders are cutting prices at the highest rate in three years due to weakening buyer demand. In July, 38% of builders reported reducing prices, with an average reduction of 5%, as they contend with negative market sentiment for the 15th consecutive month. High interest rates and broader economic concerns continue to challenge housing affordability, leading to a drop in buyer traffic to its lowest level since late 2022. Despite a slight improvement in overall builder confidence, the housing sector is expected to see a decline in single-family starts in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

Items like a cookware set and a car seat, both made in China, saw noticeable price hikes, reflecting a broader trend of rising prices in tariff-sensitive categories.

          <p>While annuities are often promoted as a secure source of guaranteed retirement income, it is possible to lose money under certain conditions. Potential risks include high surrender charges for early withdrawals, market-related losses in variable annuities, and the erosion of purchasing power from inflation in fixed annuities. Furthermore, the security of an annuity is tied to the financial stability of the issuing insurance company. Before purchasing, it's crucial for individuals to assess their personal financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance to determine if an annuity is the right fit for their retirement strategy.

          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld the state's current congressional map, rejecting a legal challenge against a plan pushed by Governor Ron DeSantis that eliminated a majority-Black district in northern Florida. The court, with a majority of DeSantis appointees, ruled that restoring the former district would constitute unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. This decision solidifies a 20-8 Republican advantage in the state's congressional delegation for the foreseeable future. Critics, including the National Redistricting Foundation, condemned the ruling as a move that diminishes the voting power of Black Floridians and abandons judicial protection against gerrymandering.</p>
