          <p>A protest outside a Dublin hotel housing asylum seekers escalated into violence, with Irish police facing missile and fireworks attacks. A police vehicle was set ablaze at the Citywest Hotel in Saggart, as thousands gathered. Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan condemned the attacks, emphasizing that such criminality would be met with a forceful response. Authorities deployed a water cannon and began clearing the area, with leaders asserting this behavior does not reflect the country's values.</p>

          <p>Federal agents conducted a targeted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation on Canal Street in New York City's Chinatown, focusing on criminal activity related to selling counterfeit goods. The crackdown led to vendors fleeing and subsequent protests, during which one "rioter" was arrested for assaulting a federal officer. City Hall officials monitored the situation, clarifying they do not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters, while Mayor Adams advocated for focusing resources on violent criminals instead of undocumented New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumously published memoir, "Nobody's Girl," details her allegations against Prince Andrew, including three instances of sexual assault, and her experiences being trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. The article highlights how Andrew's 2019 BBC interview strengthened her legal case, leading to a settlement where he did not admit wrongdoing but made a substantial donation. Giuffre also recounts meeting Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago, where she had previously worked and met Donald Trump, before being drawn into Epstein's world. Her memoir aims to empower other survivors and advocate for justice.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes has sued House Speaker Mike Johnson to compel the swearing-in of Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in September. Grijalva's delayed seating prevents her from signing a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein's files, which currently needs one more signature. Mayes argues that Johnson is disenfranchising Arizona's seventh congressional district and obstructing justice for Epstein survivors by blocking Grijalva from her rightful oath of office.</p>
