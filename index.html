          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following allegations of race-based discrimination. This action comes amid ongoing tensions between the administration and Harvard, including demands to dismantle DEI programs and vet international students for ideological red flags. Recently, the administration froze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard due to concerns about antisemitism and other issues. This investigation adds another layer to the contentious relationship between the Trump administration and the Ivy League institution.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson met with President Donald Trump to strategize on the GOP's approach to budget reconciliation, aiming to reshape federal spending. Republicans are working to cut at least $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade, facing a crucial test of their narrow majority. Johnson expressed confidence in the GOP's ability to defend its majority in upcoming elections, despite recent polling showing a decline in Trump's job approval ratings.

          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the sugar tax to include milkshakes and other milk-based drinks, aiming to combat obesity. Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the potential widening of the levy in her autumn budget last year. The proposal also includes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the tax applies. The government believes this will incentivize manufacturers to further reduce sugar in their recipes, despite concerns from the food and drink industry about inflationary pressures.</p>

Despite claiming openness to direct talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump has increased tariffs on some Chinese imports. Diplomatically, the U.S. lacks a confirmed ambassador to Beijing and a lead negotiator for China, contributing to low trust on both sides.

Additionally, a student's major significantly impacts potential earnings, with STEM fields generally offering higher returns than fine arts or education. Navigating college choices is among the most important financial decisions a person will make. (not investment advice)</p>
