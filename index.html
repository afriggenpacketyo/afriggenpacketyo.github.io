          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents outside federal immigration court. Lander was escorting a defendant out of the court when masked agents approached and handcuffed him, requesting a judicial warrant. His wife, Meg Barnette, shared a video of the incident on social media, stating that Lander was still in custody as of early Tuesday afternoon. The incident follows the handcuffing of Senator Alex Padilla days earlier after he was forcibly removed from a press conference held by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The situation raises concerns about the administration's approach to dissent and immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>President Trump issued a stark warning to Iranian leader Ali Khamenei, labeling him an "easy target" and urging Iran to unconditionally surrender in its conflict with Israel. Trump's remarks followed reports that he vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Khamenei, signaling a potential shift in U.S. involvement. The U.S. president asserted "complete and total control of the skies over Iran" and suggested direct military intervention might be considered. Trump's comments came as he abruptly returned from the G7 summit to address the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which has seen five days of missile exchanges. The U.S. president is expected to discuss the matter with his national security advisors. Optimism is tempered by the gravity of the situation. </p>

          <p>R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after allegedly being given a potentially lethal amount of medication by prison staff, according to his lawyer. The lawyer alleges the Bureau of Prisons is attempting to kill Kelly to cover up crimes committed during the investigation of his case. Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June and was given additional medication by prison personnel on Thursday evening, after which he felt faint and dizzy. He was taken to a hospital where doctors found blood clots in both legs and his lungs, but officers removed him from the hospital against medical advice, according to his lawyer. This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody over alleged threats to his life. </p>

          <p>The June CNBC Fed Survey reveals that respondents anticipate weaker economic growth and higher inflation compared to earlier forecasts, though the probability of a recession in the next year has decreased to 38%. Uncertainty regarding tariff policy remains high, with 71% of respondents expressing concerns. A majority (54%) expects the U.S. to reach a new trade agreement with China within approximately five months. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current rates at its June meeting and initiate rate cuts in September, with predictions of two rate reductions this year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year-end. Asked how the Fed would react to a stagflationary outcome of higher prices and weaker growth, 54% believe the central bank will cut rates while 39% see the Fed holding rates steady.

          <p>According to a top security expert, only the U.S. military possesses the capabilities to destroy Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, believed to be capable of producing a nuclear warhead in days. Israel's recent strikes against Iran's nuclear program did not target Fordow, likely due to its deep underground construction. Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, emphasizes the need for specialized munitions like the "bunker buster" bomb, stealth delivery platforms, and precision intelligence to penetrate the heavily protected facility. President Trump touted the U.S. military's advanced technology and control of the skies over Iran, while the White House remained silent on potential direct strikes. The situation remains tense as the U.S. weighs its options in addressing Iran's nuclear capabilities. </p>

The Kahikinui fire, estimated at 330 acres and 85% contained, is affecting a sparsely populated area with land set aside for Native Hawaiians. Meanwhile, wildfires are also raging in the Pacific Northwest, around the Great Basin, in California, and in the Rockies, prompting warnings from forecasters about escalating fire danger. The National Interagency Fire Center reports double the number of fires compared to last year, though the acreage is less.

          <p>Iran possesses two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, one at Natanz, which Israel attacked, and another at Fordo. The Fordo site has long been of most concern to international monitors and experts, due to its location deep within a mountain. While U.S. intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, Israel's military has asserted that Iran was "racing towards a nuclear bomb." The IAEA declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts, with Fordo being a major concern due to its location and size, and because it has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes. The situation raises concerns about the potential for nuclear weapons development. </p>

          <p>Yellow heat health alerts have been issued for most of England, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 33C by the weekend. The alerts warn of possible impacts on health and social services, particularly for vulnerable populations. Temperatures across the UK will continue to climb, potentially leading to heatwave conditions. While such heat is not unprecedented, it is considered intense, and the Met Office notes that heatwaves are becoming more likely due to climate change. People are urged to take precautions and check on vulnerable family, friends, and neighbors. </p>

Australian historians pinpointed the location in 1998, and subsequent research confirmed their findings. The Endeavour, used by Cook for his voyages across the Pacific, was later used to transport British troops and detain prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. The ship was deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in 1778. Efforts are underway to protect the wreck site due to its historical and cultural significance. </p>

Baroness Casey said she changed her mind on the need for a national inquiry after being "unimpressed" that more local councils did not volunteer to set up their own inquiries and some organisations were reluctant to talk to her own investigators. Baroness Casey also stressed the importance of the report's call to ensure adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 "face the most serious charge of sexual assault" instead of lesser charges. The report highlights poor data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrators and suggests officials had "shied away" from the issue.</p>
