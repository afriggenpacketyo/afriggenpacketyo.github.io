          <p>The Canadian government has withdrawn its planned digital services tax on U.S. technology companies, prompting the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the tax a "direct and blatant attack." Prime Minister Mark Carney's office confirmed that he and Trump agreed to restart negotiations following a phone call. While the decision is aimed at advancing a new economic and security relationship, some analysts view it as a significant concession to U.S. pressure, potentially making the Canadian government appear vulnerable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising threats from Russia, leading conservative German politician Jens Spahn has called for Europe to develop its own nuclear deterrent capabilities. Spahn argued that the existing U.S. nuclear umbrella is no longer sufficient and that Europe must discuss German or joint European participation in the nuclear arsenals of France and Great Britain. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from left-leaning parties, who accuse Spahn of undermining nuclear non-proliferation efforts. This debate reflects growing concerns across Europe about security and the need for greater strategic autonomy in defense matters.</p>

          <p>Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) has passed a motion calling for preparations to ban the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The move follows the classification of the AfD as a "right-wing extremist" group by the domestic intelligence agency, a designation currently suspended pending a legal challenge. However, Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt of the conservative CSU has urged caution, stating that a political party conference decision is not a government mandate. The debate highlights deep divisions within the German political landscape over how to handle the AfD's growing popularity.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly three-quarters of people in Germany are concerned their pensions will be insufficient to maintain their current living standards. In response, over half of the respondents indicated a willingness to work beyond the official retirement age, which is gradually rising to 67. Most of those willing to continue working would prefer part-time arrangements up to the age of 70. This sentiment comes as the German government considers new rules to facilitate longer careers for older workers amid widespread economic anxiety about retirement security.</p>

As Ukraine's second-largest supporter after the United States, Germany's commitment is particularly significant as Europe attempts to compensate for uncertainty in U.S. aid.

          <p>Market speculation has grown around a potential takeover of British oil giant BP, following a period of strategic uncertainty and underperforming shares. The company's situation is traced back to a 2020 pivot towards renewable energy under former CEO Bernard Looney, whose abrupt departure in 2023 left the firm's direction in question. Despite a strategic reset under new CEO Murray Auchincloss to increase oil and gas investment, investor confidence has not recovered. This has positioned BP as a possible acquisition target for rivals like Shell, Chevron, or Exxon Mobil. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump recently extended the deadline for the sale to September 17, his third extension since the law was upheld by the Supreme Court.

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has kicked in, reducing a 25% tariff on British cars to 10% and prompting manufacturers like Aston Martin and JLR to resume shipments. The auto industry had been hit hard by the tariff, with exports down significantly. However, the deal has been criticized by British farmers, who argue that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip. Concessions on tariff-free beef quotas and the removal of tariffs on American ethanol have left the UK's farming and biofuel sectors feeling disadvantaged. (not investment advice)</p>

The protests, initially sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse blamed on corruption, are now demanding snap elections and the release of demonstrators arrested during a massive rally. Protesters used metal fences and garbage containers to create blockades in response to the detentions. President Vucic has rejected calls for an early election, accusing the movement of causing "terror" and being fueled by foreign powers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russia's muted response to recent U.S. and Israeli attacks on its ally, Iran, reveals Moscow's declining status as a global superpower. The author contends that Russia's military and financial resources are severely strained by its prolonged war in Ukraine, leaving it unable to effectively support its international partners. Instead of providing military aid to Iran, Moscow offered only verbal condemnations and mediation, a pattern of strategic neglect also seen in Syria and Armenia. This demonstrates a significant blow to Russia's credibility as a reliable ally on the world stage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles (EVs) are more likely to induce motion sickness than conventional cars due to their unique performance characteristics. Researchers have identified the rapid acceleration and deceleration, particularly the low-frequency slowing caused by regenerative braking systems, as key factors. This function, which recharges the battery by converting kinetic energy, can provoke queasiness and discomfort in passengers. As EVs become more prevalent, especially in markets like China, addressing this issue is becoming a more significant concern for automotive engineers and manufacturers aiming to improve passenger comfort.</p>

In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, noting that leaders who demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an "endangered species," which contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.</p>

Grossi emphasized the importance of allowing IAEA inspectors back into the country to verify the status of remaining materials and centrifuges.
