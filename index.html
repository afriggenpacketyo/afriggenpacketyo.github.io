            <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that he can guarantee that the Trump administration's deregulatory actions will not adversely affect public health or the environment. Zeldin emphasized the importance of balancing environmental protection with economic growth, highlighting the administration's reconsideration of regulations across various sectors, including power plants and oil and gas development. He argued that the American people want common sense applied to regulations and that the previous administration's regulations were too broad and costly, ultimately impacting the American economy. Zeldin encouraged public participation in the deregulatory process through public comments.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing bipartisan criticism for the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who lived in Maryland, due to an "administrative error." Senator John Kennedy, a Republican, called the deportation a "screw up," while Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, described the case as a "constitutional crisis." The administration has refused to bring Abrego Garcia back despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return, sparking debate over due process and the administration's immigration policies. Van Hollen defended his trip to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, emphasizing the importance of respecting constitutional rights for all individuals.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an extraordinary overnight order temporarily blocking the removal of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). Solicitor General John Sauer criticized the order as "unprecedented," arguing that the plaintiffs have no standing since the government has already paused their deportations and is allowing the legal process to unfold. Sauer urged the court to limit the order to AEA removals only, emphasizing that lower courts have not yet weighed in on the government's notification and appeal process.</p>

            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, North London, by Toby Carvery has sparked outrage and a national conversation. The tree was cut down on health and safety grounds after the owners of Toby Carvery received advice it was dead. Local residents and campaigners are questioning the decision, expressing sadness and anger over the loss of a significant part of the park's history. The incident has also raised concerns about broader changes happening to Whitewebbs Park, including a lease agreement with Tottenham Hotspur football club.</p>
