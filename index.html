          <p>Semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and profit, driven by strong demand for AI-related chips. However, the company issued cautious guidance for the third quarter and narrowed its full-year 2025 sales growth forecast to 15%. Citing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, CEO Christophe Fouquet stated that while the company is preparing for growth in 2026, it cannot be confirmed at this stage. The Dutch firm is a critical supplier, making the advanced lithography machines necessary for producing the world's most sophisticated semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UK defence secretary Sir Ben Wallace has defended his decision to seek a gagging order to prevent reporting on a major data breach involving Afghan allies. The 2022 leak exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK relocation, information that only became public after a High Court judge lifted the injunction. Writing in the Telegraph, Sir Ben stated the move was to protect those at risk from the Taliban and was not a cover-up. The government has since apologized and established a new resettlement scheme for those affected by the leak.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 02:25:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate rose to 3.6% in June, surpassing economists' forecasts of 3.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. This uptick was primarily driven by motor fuel prices, which did not fall as much as they did in the previous year, and a continued increase in food price inflation. The data highlights ongoing cost-of-living pressures for consumers, with the British pound strengthening against the dollar following the announcement. U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves acknowledged that the government has more work to do to ease the pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma farmer was tragically killed by two water buffalo he had purchased just one day prior to the incident. The man, identified as Bradley McMichael, reportedly became trapped inside their enclosure while attending to them on his farm in Jones. First responders were initially unable to reach the victim due to the animals' aggressive behavior, forcing them to dispatch both buffalo to secure the scene. Police confirmed that evidence indicated the water buffalo were responsible for McMichael's fatal injuries, and the investigation is currently ongoing.</p>

          <p>The MLB All-Star Game was decided by its first-ever home run swing-off, with an unexpected hero emerging in the form of Dodgers third-base coach Dino Ebel. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Ebel took the mound to pitch to the National League's selected hitters in the high-pressure tiebreaker. His steady pitches enabled Kyle Schwarber to hit three consecutive home runs, securing a 4-3 victory in the swing-off and a 7-6 overall win for the NL. Players and managers praised the exciting new format and credited the 59-year-old coach for his crucial role.</p>

This movement is compounded by the weaponization of the dollar through sanctions and growing concerns among European allies about US fiscal policy and reliability, especially given America's ballooning national debt and deficit-funded military aid.

A recent DOJ memo stating there is no client list and confirming Epstein's death as a suicide has fueled further controversy and infighting.

          <p>The United Kingdom's retail sector is facing an accelerating crisis, with thousands of store closures and job losses expected this year, far exceeding previous years. A 'perfect storm' of factors is blamed, including increased payroll taxes, a higher minimum wage, rising business rates, and a shift in consumer behavior towards online shopping and frugality. Well-known brands like New Look and River Island are struggling, following the path of many others that have already closed. This analysis suggests the downturn may be structural rather than cyclical, permanently altering the landscape of British high streets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary nomination for a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. She will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in the September general election for the deep-blue district. Grijalva, a progressive, ran on a platform of protecting democracy, immigrant rights, and social programs, securing high-profile endorsements from figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The seat is one of three vacant Democratic-held seats that will likely narrow the GOP's slim House majority.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows the rapid transformation of college athletics since 2021, when rules were relaxed to allow student-athletes to be compensated. The executive order aims to create a federal framework that would supersede the current patchwork of state laws governing NIL deals. The action comes as a House subcommittee advanced a bill to regulate the area, reflecting a growing federal interest in managing the new financial landscape of college sports.</p>

          <p>The murder trial has begun for James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors allege that Craig, who was having an affair and facing financial difficulties, was motivated by a life insurance payout. They presented evidence of his internet search history, which included queries on how to make a murder look like a heart attack. The defense argues the evidence is insufficient and has suggested his wife, who was aware of his infidelity, may have taken her own life.</p>

This action is part of an aggressive administration strategy to use 'third country' agreements to carry out deportations of non-citizens.
