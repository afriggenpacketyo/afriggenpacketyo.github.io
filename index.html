          <p>Following claims of heavy metal pollution in northern Thai rivers linked to mining in Myanmar, the Chinese embassy in Thailand stated it is closely monitoring the situation. The embassy acknowledged comments by the Thai government and said it is willing to work with Mekong basin countries to protect the ecology and water quality. The embassy emphasized that Chinese companies overseas are required to abide by host countries' laws and regulations. Last week, Thailand's Pollution Control Department reported unsafe levels of heavy metals in sediment samples from rivers in northern Thailand, attributing the contamination to upstream mining operations. The lead levels were particularly high in the Sai and Kok rivers near the Thai-Myanmar border. The article did not reflect any financial advice. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

President Trump announced the deployment of 2,000 National Guard soldiers, a move criticized by California Gov. Gavin Newsom as "inflaming tensions." ICE reported arresting 118 immigrants during operations in LA last week, while protests became chaotic, with law enforcement using flash bangs, tear gas, and rubber bullets.

However, a new analysis reveals that emissions from American fossil-fuel plants contribute 5% of all planet-heating pollution since 1990. The analysis also points out that emissions from a single year in 2022 will cause 5,300 deaths in the US from air pollution and $370 billion in global damages.

          <p>Netflix's new series, 'The Eternaut,' is based on a revered Argentine comic and begins with a group of friends on a sailboat witnessing a strange green glow and the city's lights blacking out. As a toxic snowfall begins, one of the card players, Juan, sets out into Buenos Aires in makeshift protective gear to find his daughter. The series, set in familiar locales, has a special resonance in Argentina due to its political freight and near-mythic status. The series brings the action from the 1950s to the modern age, exploring themes of collective action and societal horrors. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
