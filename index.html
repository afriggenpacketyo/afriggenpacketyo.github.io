        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, has upheld a temporary injunction against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants, sending the case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court found that the government failed to provide the migrants with adequate time or information to contest their removals, emphasizing the importance of due process. The justices did not rule on the overall lawfulness of the deportations under the Act, but urged lower courts to address these cases expeditiously, balancing national security interests with constitutional rights. Lee Gelernt of the ACLU praised the decision as preventing hurried deportations to potentially dangerous situations.</p>

          <h2>Comey's Social Media Post Sparks Controversy Over Meaning of '86'</h2>

          <p>Former FBI director James Comey's social media post featuring the numbers '86 47' has ignited controversy, with Republicans accusing him of calling for violence against President Trump. The phrase 'to 86' is a common restaurant term meaning 'to remove or eject,' but it can also mean 'to kill.' Comey deleted his post, claiming ignorance of the violent interpretation, while Trump alleges Comey was calling for his assassination. The term's origin is uncertain, with theories ranging from soda counter slang to Prohibition-era bar evictions.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency initiative, NPR reports on the dramatic shrinkage of parts of the federal government. The report connects individual stories about federal workers losing their jobs around the country and how Americans far beyond Washington may feel the effects of these cuts. The team of NPR reporters has been looking at agencies â€” from food inspectors to nuclear scientists to firefighters and more â€” and today, we'll connect some of the dots on how DOGE cuts have impacted workers.</p>

The escape involved creating a hole in a cell wall and exiting through a loading dock. Sheriff Susan Hutson said there are indications that the detainees received assistance from individuals inside the department, and officials are investigating multiple security failures. One escapee has been apprehended, while the search for the remaining nine continues.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administrationâ€™s appeal to quickly resume deportations of Venezuelans under an 18th-century wartime law. The justices acted on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men who have been accused of being gang members. The court had already called a temporary halt to the deportations from a north Texas detention facility in a middle-of-the-night order issued last month. At least three federal judges have said Trump was improperly using the AEA to speed deportations of people the administration says are Venezuelan gang members.</p>

Specifically, Representatives Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas led the charge.
