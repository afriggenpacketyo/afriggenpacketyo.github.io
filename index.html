          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was quelled after officers used gas to force inmates back into their cells, according to the Trousdale County Sheriff's Department. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their assigned housing units, prompting a multi-agency response. Three guards were briefly held hostage but were safely released without major injuries. Sheriff Ray Russell stated that there was no threat of escape, as the prisoners were contained within a yard. The situation was resolved after gas was deployed into the yard, compelling the inmates to return to their cells. The priority was to restore order and ensure the safety of both staff and inmates, preventing any further escalation of the disturbance.</p>

The injured members, part of the 101st explosive ordnance disposal unit, suffered burns, marking the unit's first such incident. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of safely disposing of unexploded bombs, as many remain buried in Okinawa. The Self-Defense Forces conducted numerous disposal operations in fiscal 2023, highlighting the ongoing efforts to clear unexploded ordnance in the region.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles intensified over the weekend in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Demonstrators blocked a major freeway, set self-driving cars on fire, and vandalized buildings, including the LAPD Headquarters. Police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and flash bangs to control the crowds, resulting in dozens of arrests. California Governor Gavin Newsom requested the removal of the Guard, calling their deployment a breach of state sovereignty, while Mayor Karen Bass blamed the administration for provoking chaos. The protests stemmed from federal agents arresting immigrants in the LA area, sparking widespread anger and fear among residents. The arrival of the National Guard has heightened tensions, leading to calls for peaceful demonstrations and condemnation of the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly close to appointing Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach following the departure of Ange Postecoglou. Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham in the coming days, though no official dialogue has been confirmed. Frank, the Danish manager, has emerged as a leading candidate to fill the vacancy at Spurs. Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, with sources suggesting that Tottenham would need to pay over Â£10 million to release him from his current contract. The final figure could increase depending on the number of staff Frank brings with him.</p>

          <p>The Taihuttu family, known as the 'Bitcoin Family,' has revamped its security measures after facing kidnapping threats targeting cryptocurrency executives. They now use a hybrid analog-digital system, encrypting and splitting seed phrases, storing them via blockchain encryption or hiding them across four continents. The family sold all their possessions in 2017 to invest in bitcoin and now travels full-time, remaining unbanked. They have stopped using hardware wallets, opting for decentralized storage to protect their assets. This shift comes after a series of attacks and kidnappings targeting crypto holders, prompting a demand for physical protection and specialized insurance policies.</p>

Cable networks have lost viewers to streaming services, causing a stock slump.

He now leads the party's Doge unit, inspired by Donald Trump's efficiency initiative, aiming to cut wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils.

Gordon and Marten deny manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of a child.

Victoria's decomposed body was found in a shopping bag in an allotment shed in Brighton in March 2023.

This marks Chipotle's first new dip since the introduction of queso blanco in 2020. The company reported its first same-store sales decline since 2020 in the first quarter, citing consumer concerns about the economy. The Adobo Ranch, made with adobo peppers, sour cream, and herbs and spices, will cost an additional 75 cents per order. Chipotle hopes the new offering will attract cautious diners back to its restaurants.</p>

          <p>United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres cautioned against unregulated deep-sea mining at the UN Oceans Conference in Nice, France. French President Emmanuel Macron echoed this sentiment, stating that "oceans are not for sale." These remarks appear to reference President Trump's decision to issue permits for extracting critical minerals in international waters. Marine scientists are concerned about the potential harm to marine ecosystems. Macron emphasized that the ocean is a shared good, and predatory economic actions disrupting the deep seabed should be avoided. The UN aims to have 60 countries ratify a High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of international waters by 2030.</p>

Bank of America had previously identified Robinhood as a top candidate for inclusion, which typically sparks significant trading activity and investment from passive funds. Crypto exchange Coinbase recently benefited from such an inclusion, with its stock price surging.

          <p>Las Vegas is implementing a simple climate solution to combat rising temperatures: planting more trees, particularly in urban heat island neighborhoods. These areas, often lower-income, lack shade and experience significantly higher temperatures. Research indicates that trees can lower surrounding temperatures by at least 10 degrees. The city, county, and nonprofits are collaborating to plant thousands of drought-tolerant trees annually. A new state law requires major cities and counties to develop heat mitigation plans. The Southern Nevada Heat Resilience Lab studies heat's impact on communities and recommends data-based solutions, emphasizing the importance of trees for long-term community viability.</p>

The Fremont Gurdwara Sahib requests the Department of Justice to launch a national security investigation to determine if HAF should register as an Indian foreign agent. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, this would require HAF to disclose its activities, including meetings with lawmakers and financial ties to the Indian government. HAF denies these claims, asserting its independence and lack of affiliation with any political parties. The allegations come amid tensions between Sikh separatists and the Indian government, with accusations of transnational repression against Sikhs outside India.</p>

          <p>Proposed changes to student loan programs could significantly impact low-income families' access to higher education. The changes would reduce Pell Grant eligibility, requiring students to take more credit hours to qualify for the maximum amount. Subsidized loans, which don't accrue interest while students are in school, would also be eliminated. Lifetime borrowing caps would be imposed, potentially limiting access to professional programs like medical school. These cuts could lead students to rely on private lenders with higher interest rates, making college less affordable. The bill's impact is particularly concerning for community colleges, where many part-time students could see their aid reduced or eliminated.</p>
