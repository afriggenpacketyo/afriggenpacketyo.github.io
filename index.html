            <p>A new documentary, "Titanic: The Digital Resurrection," utilizes a full-size 3D scan to create a "digital twin" of the Titanic, revealing new details about the ship's final hours. The scan seemingly confirms eyewitness accounts that ship engineers were shoveling coal into the ship's furnaces in order to keep the lights on for as long as possible as passengers escaped. The scan also shows that the iceberg caused six small tears in the hull, exceeding the ship's design to withstand damage to only four compartments. The 3D model allows analysts to study the wreckage for generations to come, even as the real ship decays.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's recent physical examination indicated that he is in excellent health, according to White House physician Sean Barbella. The report highlighted Trump's robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function. Trump's high cholesterol is well-controlled with medication, and his cognitive abilities remain sharp, as demonstrated by a perfect score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The report also noted a scar on his right ear from a gunshot wound sustained during an assassination attempt last year.</p>

            <p>Scientists have discovered a 520-million-year-old fossil of a worm larva with its brain and guts still intact. The fossil provides a unique window into the past, allowing experts to better understand evolutionary links between ancient and present-day arthropods. The preserved structures include a brain, digestive glands, a primitive circulatory system, and traces of nerves supplying the larva's simple legs and eyes. The find has revealed that early arthropods were more complex than previously thought and has allowed scientists to draw evolutionary connections to modern creatures.</p>

            <p>U.S. stock markets are anticipated to rebound following President Trump's decision to exclude smartphones and laptops from his tariff regime. Shares in Apple and chip maker Nvidia are expected to rise after tariffs on their products were lifted temporarily. China has responded with a tariff on all U.S. exports of 125%. However, the U.S. commerce secretary indicated that the reprieve is likely to be lifted in 90 days, with a different levy applied to the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused Donald Trump of "weaponizing" the global trading system with steep import tariffs. Brown warned that these policies threaten a breakdown in the global economic order. He urged governments and central banks to develop a "global rescue plan" similar to the actions taken during the 2008 financial crisis. Brown also called for synchronized interest rate cuts to cushion the blow from the tariffs. He emphasized the need for countries to rebuild the world order based on the rule of law, human rights, and climate action.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry called on the U.S. to "completely abolish" reciprocal tariffs, as the trade war between the two countries continues. The ministry described the U.S. tariff exemptions as a "small step" and urged President Trump to heed rational voices. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that there are currently no plans for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to speak. The exemptions are being presented domestically as Trump backing down and evidence that Chinese supply chains are not easily replaceable.</p>

While acknowledging the context of prioritizing the Europa League quarter-final, the carelessness and incompetence displayed in the loss raise concerns about Postecoglou's future. The team's performance has resulted in the most league defeats since the 2003-04 season, placing Postecoglou's job in jeopardy.</p>
