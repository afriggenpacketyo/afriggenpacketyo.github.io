Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pursuing a series of high-level diplomatic meetings to increase pressure on Russia and secure further international support. Meanwhile, President Putin publicly thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for his soldiers' involvement in the conflict, highlighting the deepening military cooperation between the two nations amid reports of significant North Korean casualties.</p>

          <p>The Trump family has launched a public cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, which initially added billions to their wealth on paper, though the token's value has since declined. The venture was co-founded by the former president and his sons, marking a significant reversal from Trump's previous description of crypto as a scam. This move has prompted serious concerns from government ethics and financial experts regarding potential conflicts of interest, especially as Trump has appointed crypto-friendly regulators to his administration while his family directly engages in the industry.</p>

Citing this positive momentum and a healthy inventory position, Macy's raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, expressing cautious optimism despite potential headwinds from tariffs, which it says are now factored into its outlook.

          <p>Victims of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are scheduled to appear publicly alongside a bipartisan group of lawmakers to advocate for the release of all federal investigation files related to his case. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie are leading the effort, using a procedural motion to try and force a House vote on the matter. The push for transparency comes after the House Oversight Committee released nearly 34,000 pages of documents, which critics, including some lawmakers, have dismissed as containing little new information.</p>

          <p>For the first time, players in the top two tiers of professional women's soccer in England will be guaranteed a minimum salary, described as a "full-time wage." This new requirement is part of a broader effort by WSL Football, the company overseeing the leagues, to increase professional standards and support players who previously had to juggle part-time jobs. The regulations also mandate enhanced high-performance environments and welfare support, reflecting the rapid growth and increasing investment in the women's game.</p>

Applications for home purchases dropped by 3%, indicating that high home prices and persistent affordability challenges continue to deter potential buyers. While refinancing applications saw a minor increase, the pullback in purchase activity suggests that modest rate drops are not yet enough to overcome the significant financial barriers facing many in the current housing market.

It suggests that deferring to union demands on issues like trade tariffs and construction rules can increase living costs, undermining the party's goal of addressing economic affordability. The author argues that Democrats should revert to a more traditional, qualified support for labor, where union interests are balanced against the broader public good, especially in an inflationary economy where make-work policies can be harmful.</p>

Schattschneider, the author argues that by defining themselves as defenders of the status quo against a populist insurgency, Democrats have accepted a losing political conflict. Instead of testing new slogans, the party should redefine the entire battle, perhaps by framing it as a struggle between "builders" who create value and "extractors" who hoard wealth, thereby creating new coalitions and a more favorable political terrain.</p>

          <p>China showcased several new and advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) during its largest-ever military parade, revealing significant advancements in its nuclear arsenal. Among the surprises were the previously unknown DF-61 and DF-31BJ missiles, as well as the advanced DF-5C and the submarine-launched JL-3. The display of these long-range, nuclear-capable weapons, designed to travel between continents, signals a major development in China's strategic military capabilities and its efforts to modernize its forces.</p>

          <p>An ecosystem of right-leaning podcasts and YouTube shows, often termed the "manosphere," which was influential in Donald Trump's election, is now showing signs of fragmentation and declining support for his administration. While some hosts remain loyal, others have grown critical of his policies on tariffs and his administration's lack of transparency on issues like the Epstein case. This shift, which includes disillusionment and a pivot away from politics, could present a challenge for the Republican party in maintaining the unconventional coalition of young, male voters that helped Trump win.</p>

          <p>While ambitions for human settlement on Mars are growing, significant biological challenges must be overcome, as the human body is not ready for long-duration space travel. The nascent field of space medicine is working to address issues like radiation exposure, muscle loss, and psychological stress, which currently disqualify most people from becoming astronauts. Researchers are studying the effects of microgravity on human health to develop countermeasures, with the goal of making space travel safer and more accessible, which could in turn lead to medical breakthroughs for diseases on Earth.</p>

          <p>The personal wardrobe of the late Venezuelan-born painter Luchita Hurtado, crafted entirely by her own hands, is being shared publicly for the first time. For nearly 80 years, Hurtado designed and wore a utilitarian uniform, typically a boxy shirt with four pockets, which she adapted with various fabrics and details. This practice began when she was dissatisfied with available maternity clothes and grew into a lifelong expression of her intentional lifestyle, where she manifested her own reality in her art, her journals, and the very clothes she wore.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Greg Gutfeld reflects on the success of his late-night show, "Gutfeld!," which has become the most-watched program in its time slot by drawing over 3 million viewers nightly.

Gutfeld argues that mainstream late-night shows alienated a large portion of the country by becoming too politically one-sided, creating an opportunity for a program that prioritizes having fun regardless of the political climate.</p>

Political strategists suggest that while money provides access, voters are often suspicious of ultra-rich candidates, perceiving an "empathy gap" and a sense of entitlement that makes it difficult for them to connect with the lives and concerns of average citizens.</p>

          <p>After decades of dangerous landslides and costly temporary repairs, the California Department of Transportation is moving forward with a plan to build a $2.1 billion tunnel to bypass Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile stretch of Highway 101. This section of road is the only viable link for the remote community of Crescent City to the rest of the state and is built atop four active landslides. The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel, which would be the longest in California, is seen as a permanent solution to a problem that has claimed lives and repeatedly severed a critical economic lifeline.</p>
