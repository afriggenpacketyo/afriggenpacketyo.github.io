          <h2>Trump Announces Plan for Executive Order Mandating Voter ID</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 08:40:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to sign an executive order aimed at requiring voter identification in all U.S. elections. This move follows a previous, similar attempt that was blocked by a federal judge who ruled that the executive branch lacks the authority to set election regulations, a power the Constitution delegates to Congress and the states. The article also cites polling data indicating that voter ID requirements have broad public support across the political spectrum, including among Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details innovative approaches to understanding and treating chronic pain. The article focuses on "reverse translational research," a method that begins with a patient's lived experience to identify objective biological markers for pain within the brain. It highlights a groundbreaking clinical trial where implanted electrodes were used to predict and then interrupt pain signals through deep brain stimulation, offering a new frontier for pain management.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is entering a new, multipolar arms race that significantly elevates the danger of conflict involving advanced ballistic missiles. The author draws a parallel to the Cold War, warning that today's adversaries can similarly hold each other's populations hostage under the threat of nuclear war. The piece concludes that while the fundamental logic of war remains unchanged, modern technology has radically increased the potential scale of suffering, threatening the global strategic environment.</p>

          <p>This article describes a poignant photojournalism project that captures the bedrooms of children killed in school shootings, left untouched since their deaths. CBS News' Steve Hartman and photographer Lou Bopp worked with the families to create these powerful portraits of absence, which serve as static memorials to the young lives lost. The parents hope that sharing these deeply personal and grief-filled spaces will resonate with the public and inspire meaningful change to prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines President Trump's efforts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, focusing on his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook. Financial experts and legal scholars warn that such a move threatens the central bank's long-standing political independence, which is crucial for economic stability. While Trump's goal is to lower interest rates to manage federal debt and boost the economy, critics fear that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility and potentially lead to severe consequences like hyperinflation.

          <p>This article critically examines the U.S. Justice Department's interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, suggesting that interviewers failed to follow up on significant leads regarding Jeffrey Epstein's powerful connections. For example, when Maxwell hinted that Epstein associates were in Trump's cabinet, she was not pressed for names. Critics, including victims' attorneys, argue that the released transcripts prioritize the appearance of transparency over a genuine investigation, leaving crucial questions about the extent of Epstein's network unanswered.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, celebrates the little-known story of how surfing first arrived on the U.S. mainland in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes, who were studying in the area, crafted surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the traditional royal sport to an astonished local population. This act of "surf diplomacy" is now recognized as the seed that grew into America's vibrant surfing culture, a historical contribution that the exhibition aims to bring to wider public attention.</p>

          <p>A former National Guard member writes that the increasing deployment of the Guard for domestic law enforcement and to fill civilian job shortages is a dangerous distortion of its core mission. The author argues that using troops as a stopgap for underfunded public services blurs the line between military and civilian roles, erodes public trust, and undermines democracy. This misuse not only fails to address the root causes of social problems but also compromises the Guard's readiness for genuine emergencies and national security tasks.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration is now actively working to dismantle the very COVID-19 vaccine program it once championed as a "medical miracle" through Operation Warp Speed. Under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic, the government is canceling funding for new mRNA vaccine research and altering official recommendations for their use. This new direction is actively sowing public doubt about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, threatening to restrict access for many Americans.</p>

          <p>The trend of taking high-risk selfies, dubbed "killfies," continues to be a deadly global problem, with India reporting the highest number of fatalities. Recent studies show that a significant portion of all selfie-related deaths and injuries occur in India, often from falls from heights or dangerous encounters with animals. Psychologists suggest the behavior is driven by a quest for online validation that overrides basic safety instincts, while authorities are now also concerned about selfie-taking creating hazardous crowd situations at large public gatherings.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, has announced a major policy shift, pledging to remove all net-zero climate requirements on oil and gas companies to maximize fossil fuel extraction from the North Sea. This plan would scrap mandates for emissions reduction and investment in carbon capture technology, directly contradicting the current Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses. The move signals a significant departure from the UK's legally binding 2050 net-zero target and has been labeled as "reckless" by environmental groups.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the death of an infant from whooping cough, the first such fatality this year. The baby's mother had not been vaccinated against the disease during pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns. This tragic case highlights the growing concern over declining vaccination rates in the UK, where uptake for major childhood vaccines has fallen below the 95% target needed for herd immunity, prompting renewed calls from health officials for timely immunizations.</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha has created a significant supply bottleneck, causing prices for the green tea powder to soar even in Japan. The boom, driven by matcha's reputation as a health superfood and a rise in tourism, has strained Japan's aging tea-farming industry. The labor-intensive process of producing high-quality tencha leaves for matcha cannot keep up, leading retailers to ration their stock and major beverage companies to create specialized divisions to manage the challenging supply chain.</p>

While voters perceive the party as weak, a growing generic ballot lead over Republicans and increasing dislike for President Trump provide strategic openings. The party is currently engaged in internal debates on how to reconnect with working-class voters and refine its economic message, with strategists outlining a recovery plan focused on opposing Trump and winning the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>This opinion essay connects Toni Morrison's 1995 writings on fascism to the current political climate, arguing that American racism has always been fascism's "succubus twin." The author suggests that the long history of Black resistance—characterized by a deep belief in democratic ideals, diverse protest strategies, and enduring faith—offers a powerful and necessary model for confronting modern authoritarian threats. This historical perspective calls for a sustained fight for justice that goes beyond a single election and draws strength from a legacy of resilience.</p>
