          <p>Director Ryan Coogler, known for "Creed" and "Black Panther," revealed he was once $200,000 in debt from film school. His new movie "Sinners" deal with Warner Bros. includes a rare provision granting him ownership rights after 25 years. This allows him to potentially receive royalties and merchandising deals, inspired by his family's history and struggle for ownership in the Jim Crow South. This deal is a rarity in Hollywood, where directors typically don't retain ownership rights. (not investment advice)</p>
