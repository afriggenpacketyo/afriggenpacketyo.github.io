          <p>Uvalde city leaders have approved a $2 million settlement for the families of the victims of the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting. The settlement, which marks the first financial compensation related to the lawsuits filed after the tragedy, includes enhanced training for city police officers and expanded mental health services for the community. The agreement also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance and a permanent memorial in the city plaza. While families express mixed feelings, they hope this agreement enables healing for both the families who lost loved ones and the city itself.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted by 0.1% year-on-year in the first quarter, marking the first contraction in four years, primarily due to a sharp decline in construction activity. This downturn coincides with political uncertainty, including impeachment trials of the former president and prime minister, and ongoing trade war tensions, particularly tariffs imposed by the U.S. on steel and automobiles. The Bank of Korea had previously warned of slower GDP growth for 2025, and some analysts anticipate further rate cuts in response to the economic slowdown. The country's export-led economy is facing challenges from both domestic and international factors.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg has announced that China has stopped taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to the ongoing trade war and associated tariffs imposed by the U.S. This has led Boeing to consider reallocating some of the affected 737 Max planes, originally destined for Chinese airlines, to other customers. Despite this setback, Ortberg expressed confidence in the demand for the Max aircraft and stated that the situation would not derail the company's recovery. The announcement comes after Boeing reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the first quarter, indicating resilience in the face of trade-related challenges.</p>

This comes as the U.S. administration proposes freezing territorial lines in Ukraine close to their current positions, requiring both Ukraine and Russia to make concessions.

          <p>Foreigners who overstay their visas in Japan face the stigma of criminality, despite often seeking employment due to unavoidable circumstances. While Japan deports thousands annually for violating immigration laws, some argue that being undocumented should not be equated with criminal offenses like theft or assault. There's growing international recognition of the need for more neutral terms like "irregular" or "undocumented" immigrants to protect human rights, but Japan has seen little progress in revising its language. Efforts are underway to promote the use of less stigmatizing terms to address prejudice and discrimination against immigrants and refugees.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's GOP congressional delegation are appealing to President Trump after FEMA denied the state's request for federal disaster relief following severe storms. The request was made after catastrophic damage, widespread destruction, and multiple deaths occurred in the state. This denial follows similar rejections of disaster relief requests from other states, including Washington and North Carolina. The situation marks the first instance of Republicans publicly challenging a denial of FEMA relief requests during Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>A bill in California aiming to sharply reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels has ignited a conflict between union electrical workers, utilities, and solar energy users. The bill, proposed by Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, who previously worked for Southern California Edison, would limit the credits for existing solar panel owners. Supporters argue it addresses inequities in electric bills, while opponents, including environmental groups and solar industry advocates, claim it undermines long-term solar contracts and favors utility profits. The bill is facing significant opposition and debate over its potential impact on the state's renewable energy goals.</p>
