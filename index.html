          <p>A large-scale manhunt is in progress for the individual who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk during an event at Utah Valley University. The FBI is assisting state and local authorities, appealing to the public for any information, photos, or videos related to the incident. Officials have described the shooting as a "targeted attack" from a distance, possibly from a rooftop, with the suspect believed to be dressed in dark clothing. The event has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, with President Trump blaming the killing on heated political rhetoric from the left.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has announced the arrest of several undocumented immigrants in Chicago as part of an operation named "Midway Blitz." The individuals taken into custody were wanted for serious offenses, including sexual assault of a child, armed robbery, and domestic battery. A Department of Homeland Security official stated that the operation targets those who exploit sanctuary city policies to evade law enforcement. The DHS released mugshots of some of the arrested individuals, describing them as among the most dangerous offenders targeted in the recent crackdown.</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as the British Ambassador to the United States. The decision follows the release of new documents detailing the extent of Mandelson's relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. According to a statement from the British Foreign Office, the newly revealed emails showed a relationship "materially different" from what was known at the time of his appointment. The communications included Mandelson calling Epstein his "best pal" and suggesting that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful, prompting his immediate removal from the key diplomatic role.</p>

          <p>During a rare visit to the United Kingdom, Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles III, for the first time since February 2024. The private meeting took place at Buckingham Palace, with Prince Harry later telling reporters that his father was "doing great" amid his cancer treatment. The visit is seen as a potential step toward reconciliation in a relationship strained by Harry and Meghan's departure from royal duties and subsequent public criticisms of the monarchy. However, sources indicate that relations with his brother, Prince William, remain non-existent, as the two did not meet despite being in close proximity.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has delivered a landmark ruling that allows men to take their wife's surname, striking down a previous law that prevented them from doing so. The case was brought by two couples who argued that the existing legislation was archaic, patriarchal, and constituted gender-based discrimination under the country's constitution. The court's decision was unopposed by the government's ministers of Home Affairs and Justice. Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect this significant victory for gender equality in the nation.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature has directly linked more than 200 severe global heat waves to the greenhouse gas pollution from major fossil fuel and cement companies. The research found that events like the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome were made substantially more likely and intense due to the emissions of these "carbon majors." Scientists concluded that some of these extreme weather events would have been "virtually impossible" without the climate pollution from specific companies. This growing field of attribution science could become increasingly important in litigation against corporations for climate-change related damages.</p>

Estimated to cost approximately 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), the project is described as the largest integrated initiative on the river since the original dam's construction.

          <p>A proposal by Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, to annex large parts of the West Bank is creating a direct challenge to the Abraham Accords, considered a major foreign-policy achievement of the Trump administration. The Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, were predicated on Israel suspending such annexation plans. The United Arab Emirates has already warned that annexation would be a "red line," forcing the Israeli cabinet to postpone a discussion on the matter. The situation places President Trump in a difficult position, forcing him to choose between supporting his Israeli allies or preserving his diplomatic legacy with Arab partners.</p>

The ICO has investigated 215 such incidents since 2022, with 57% attributed to children, one as young as seven years old.

However, health officials and aid organizations report that the funding changes have led to shortages and rationing of these crucial supplies.

          <p>The English Football Association has charged Chelsea FC with 74 alleged rule breaches concerning payments made to agents between 2009 and 2022. The charges, which largely focus on the period when the club was owned by Roman Abramovich, relate to agents, intermediaries, and third-party investments in players. The club's new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, self-reported the potential irregularities after conducting due diligence during their purchase in 2022. Potential sanctions for the club range from a fine to a points deduction, though Chelsea's cooperation with the investigation will likely be considered a mitigating factor.</p>

          <p>University professors in the U.S. are facing an increasing number of internal investigations for alleged antisemitism due to their pro-Palestinian advocacy, often initiated through Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The article details cases where accusations, sometimes based on conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism, have led to lengthy and stressful university probes that create a chilling effect on academic freedom. As universities face pressure from the federal government and outside groups, some are launching full investigations into claims they might have previously dismissed, leaving targeted faculty feeling isolated and unsupported by their institutions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah is facing public backlash for his response to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Critics are pointing out the difference between his heartfelt condemnation of Kirk's murder and his reaction to the fatal shooting of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota in June, when he amplified misinformation suggesting the attacker was a "Marxist." Following the Minnesota shooting, Lee deleted his controversial posts after being confronted by a Democratic colleague. Social media users have accused the senator of hypocrisy, questioning why he expressed sympathy in one case of political violence but not the other.</p>

During his confinement, where he alleges he was beaten and sexually assaulted by guards, he unknowingly became a symbol for a campaign demanding his release. Now back in Venezuela, he is grappling with the trauma of his ordeal while restarting his career, supported by a recent U.S. court ruling that found the administration's actions unlawful.</p>

          <p>An octopus named Ghost, a popular resident at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, has entered senescence, the final phase of her life. As is natural for her species, she has laid a clutch of eggs and will now devote the remainder of her days to caring for them, forgoing her own needs. Because she did not have a mate, the eggs are unfertilized and will not hatch, a situation that also occurs in the wild. The aquarium announced that Ghost, who is estimated to be around four or five years old, will be moved to a behind-the-scenes habitat for her final months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a last-minute compromise, California legislative leaders have introduced a bill to streamline approvals for new onshore oil wells while simultaneously tightening regulations for offshore drilling. The deal, brokered by Governor Newsom, aims to address concerns about potential gas price spikes from refinery closures by increasing in-state oil production in Kern County. At the same time, it makes future offshore projects more difficult by imposing stricter safety requirements on pipelines. The package attempts to balance the state's economic needs and energy goals, but has drawn criticism from both environmental and industry groups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A legislative proposal by California Governor Gavin Newsom to streamline the approval process for a controversial 45-mile water tunnel under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta has failed to advance this session. The plan, which also sought authority to issue bonds for the estimated $20.1 billion project, faced strong opposition from Delta lawmakers and environmental groups. Supporters argue the tunnel is crucial for modernizing the state's water infrastructure against climate change and seismic risks. Opponents contend it would devastate the Delta's ecosystem and harm endangered fish populations, advocating for alternative solutions like water recycling and conservation instead.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk is the latest in a string of incidents, including assassination attempts on President Trump, that experts believe signal a new era of political violence in the United States. Analysts draw parallels to the fraught period of 1968, citing factors like intense economic disparity, deep political divisions, and hyperbolic rhetoric from leaders as contributors to the current climate. While leaders from both parties have condemned the violence, the immediate response has often been partisan. Experts warn that a sense of democratic despair can lead people to believe that violence is their only recourse.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used the advanced capabilities of the LIGO detectors to observationally confirm a key theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. The theory, known as the black hole area theorem, posits that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. By analyzing the gravitational waves from a black hole merger detected earlier this year, researchers were able to calculate the surface areas of the initial black holes and the final, larger one, proving the total area increased as Hawking predicted. The confirmation is a major milestone for physics and a testament to Hawking's enduring legacy.</p>
