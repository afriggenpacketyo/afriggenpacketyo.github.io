          <p>Despite a US court ruling against some of President Trump's tariffs, the BBC's Simon Jack reports that this doesn't really change the US-UK deal. UK exports of cars are currently attracting 27.5% tariffs while steel and aluminium are hit with 25% tariffs - the same as every other country. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods entering the US - such as products like salmon and whisky.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after a Texas family of four went missing after their boat capsized in waters off south-central Alaska, the vessel along with human remains have been found. Three private Alaska companies offered to help look for the family and found the missing boat along with human remains in 180 feet of water in Kachemak Bay near Homer. Divers from the state were then able to recover three sets of remains from the sunken vessel.</p>
