        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to cut the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by half before 2030. Environment Secretary Steve Reed called the current water sector "broken" and vowed tougher regulations, including potential prison sentences for executives of polluting companies, to address the public outcry over water quality. While the move sets a clear target on pollution spills for the first time, critics point out the pledge is not legally binding. The broader strategy also includes banning wet wipes containing plastic and reducing phosphorus pollution from treated wastewater.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese voters participated in a crucial election for the upper house of parliament, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition facing significant setbacks. Public frustration over soaring prices, stagnant incomes, and the rising cost of social security has fueled support for opposition parties. A poor showing for Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party could deepen political instability, though it would not immediately force a change in government. The election campaign has also been marked by the rise of a right-wing populist party, Sanseito, which has gained ground with a strong anti-foreigner and anti-globalist platform.</p>

          <p>At least 35 people, including eight children, have died after a tourist boat carrying 53 passengers capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay. The vessel, named Wonder Seas, was primarily carrying Vietnamese families from Hanoi when it was struck by bad weather, including hailstones and torrential rain. Rescue efforts have been hampered by the severe conditions, but ten survivors have been pulled from the water. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the tragic accident and have pledged to handle any violations strictly.</p>

          <p>A sports coach at National Taiwan Normal University, Chou Tai-ying, has issued a formal apology for a research project that allegedly coerced student athletes into giving blood. The case, revealed by a politician in 2024, involved claims that students were threatened with losing academic credits if they refused to participate in the blood sampling, which began in 2019. Coach Chou admitted to using unqualified students to help draw the blood and apologized for her "reckless words and behaviour." The university's principal also apologized for negligence and promised a review of its ethics and oversight procedures.</p>

          <p>Vibration plates have become a popular trend on social media, with users claiming they are effective for weight loss and burning fat. These machines use whole-body vibration to force muscles to contract and relax frequently, which may help improve strength, balance, and circulation. Fitness experts confirm that while these devices can enhance muscle activation and may offer benefits for those with busy schedules or seeking low-impact options, they are not a substitute for traditional exercise. Research on their effectiveness for weight loss is limited, and they are not recommended for everyone, particularly pregnant individuals or those with joint or cardiovascular issues.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have captured the first-ever direct glimpse of rocky planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Researchers detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing within the star's gas disk, the fundamental building blocks of planets like Earth. This discovery, made in a region analogous to our solar system's asteroid belt, provides unprecedented insight into the dawn of planetary systems. The finding suggests that the processes that formed Earth over 4.5 billion years ago could be a common occurrence in the universe, helping scientists understand the potential for other Earth-like worlds.</p>

She claimed the shooting was a tragic accident that occurred during a playful exchange where they mimicked the cartoon characters Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny, leading her to believe the gun was unloaded. However, prosecutors argued it was a deliberate execution, pointing out she shot him twice in the head with a double-action revolver that is difficult to fire rapidly by accident.

          <p>A new study from the University of Surrey has revealed that nearly half of all individuals using a hospital toilet do not wash their hands afterward. Researchers used sensors on toilets and sinks in a Danish hospital over 19 weeks and found that 43.7% of 2,636 toilet uses were not followed by handwashing. This concerning behavior, which peaked at over 60% during some weeks, poses a direct risk to patient safety by increasing the spread of illnesses. Experts involved in the study called for more effective behavioral strategies beyond posters to promote better hygiene habits in critical healthcare settings.</p>

While policymakers indicate the tariffs won't affect this week's meeting, there is a broad assumption that the ECB will cut rates if the U.S. proceeds with a 30% tariff.

          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Comes Alive But Pitching Falters in Loss to Brewers</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense showed signs of life, scoring seven runs and hitting back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, but it was not enough to overcome a poor pitching performance in an 8-7 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Starter Emmet Sheehan struggled, giving up five runs, and the bullpen allowed three more. Despite a three-RBI day from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers repeatedly failed to capitalize on key opportunities, including leaving the go-ahead run at third with no outs in the third inning. The defeat marked the team's ninth loss in its last eleven games, continuing a frustrating slump.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between Druze and Bedouin groups in southern Syria have persisted, resulting in a reported death toll of over 900 people in the past week. Despite an announced ceasefire, fighting continued in Suweida province, with all sides accused of atrocities. Government forces deployed by the interim president were reportedly involved in attacks on the Druze community. The U.S. has called for an end to the violence and for accountability, while neighboring Israel, which has a significant Druze population, has intervened with military strikes against Syrian government targets in response to the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Federal Funding Cuts to Public Media Pose Existential Threat to Rural Radio Stations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 00:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are set to severely impact small, local radio stations in rural America. Operations like Allegheny Mountain Radio, which serves remote counties in West Virginia and Virginia, rely on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for up to 65% of their budget. These stations provide essential local news, emergency information, and community connection in areas with spotty internet and phone service. Station managers worry that the funding loss, driven by political motivations, will force staff cuts or shutdowns, silencing a vital source of information for their communities.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The Failure to Achieve Peace in Global Conflicts Stems from a Moral Collapse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 00:00:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the persistent failure to find peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine is rooted in more than just political deadlock; it reflects a global crisis of morality. The author suggests that a shared, universal moral order has collapsed, replaced by moral relativism where atrocities are justified based on group identity or political alignment. This ethical fracture makes impartial mediation and conflict resolution nearly impossible. The piece critiques the public's and politicians' willingness to look the other way, arguing that ending mass suffering is a moral imperative that requires a collective, principled response.</p>

          <p>A man intentionally drove his car into a crowd outside a popular East Hollywood nightclub early Saturday, injuring 30 people, with seven reported in critical condition. Police identified the driver as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, who had allegedly been ejected from the club moments before the incident. After crashing, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the vehicle and assaulted him, and an unidentified individual shot him before fleeing the scene. The chaotic event prompted a massive emergency response, with over 100 firefighters and paramedics setting up a triage area to treat the numerous victims.</p>
