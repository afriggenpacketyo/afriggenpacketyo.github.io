          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have protested across the country against the government's plan to expand its military operation. Demonstrators fear the plan, which includes taking security control of Gaza City, endangers the lives of the remaining hostages and are demanding a deal for their release. The protests highlight a significant public divide, with polls suggesting most Israelis favor a diplomatic agreement over continued military action, despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's insistence that the operation will help free the hostages.</p>

Human rights organizations report a dire crisis, particularly in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where thousands have been killed and millions displaced. Recent massacres, including the killing of 49 Christians in a DRC church, have prompted calls for international action, with activists and local leaders urging Western governments to provide justice, protection, and restoration for affected communities.</p>

Both fighters suffered subdural hematomas and passed away within days of each other despite undergoing emergency surgery. The tragic deaths have prompted the Japan Boxing Commission to shorten championship bouts from 12 to 10 rounds and have intensified calls for stricter safety regulations in the sport.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a writer reflects on their grandmother's survival of the Warsaw ghetto to argue for the moral imperative of preventing starvation in Gaza. The author draws a parallel between the historical suffering of Jews and the current humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians, asserting that the legacy of the Holocaust should inspire empathy for all people's basic needs. The article contends that food and water for everyone must supersede security concerns for a select group, urging that intergenerational grief should unite people in condemning the suffering of the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p>After 200 days in office, critics and political commentators are increasingly warning that the Trump administration is actively moving the U.S. toward authoritarianism. They point to actions such as demanding the prosecution of political opponents, firing a government statistician over a weak jobs report, and pursuing a federal takeover of Washington D.C. as evidence of a systematic effort to dismantle democratic norms. While once dismissed as hyperbole, the concern that the nation is on a path to a consolidating dictatorship is becoming a more mainstream view.</p>

          <p>A political analysis argues that while many voters were willing to overlook President Trump's legal and ethical issues, their confidence in his effectiveness as a leader is now shattering. Recent polling shows low approval for his policies, with a majority of Americans feeling his actions on the economy and healthcare have personally harmed them. The article contends this growing perception of ineptitude, fueled by the negative impacts of tariffs and cuts to federal agencies, is a more politically toxic problem than his well-known character flaws.

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing a new 'gold rush' driven by the artificial intelligence industry, infusing the city with economic optimism but also anxiety about its future. The proliferation of AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic is revitalizing the office real estate market and attracting billions in venture capital, creating a vibrant hub of innovation. However, this boom coexists with concerns about the high cost of living, potential job displacement from AI, and the broader societal impacts of the rapidly advancing technology, creating a complex and uncertain landscape for the city.</p>

          <p>Amid confusion over recycling rules and the failure of many 'compostable' plastics, the reuse movement is gaining traction as a tangible solution to the waste crisis. A successful pilot program in Petaluma, California, saw 30 businesses offer reusable beverage cups that customers could return to collection bins citywide, with over 50% of cups being returned for washing and redistribution. This community-wide approach, which relies on civic pride over monetary incentives, demonstrates a scalable model for reducing the billions of single-use items discarded annually.</p>

          <p>Cities like Los Angeles and Bangkok are exploring the 'sponge city' concept to manage increasingly severe flooding caused by climate change. This approach replaces impermeable concrete with absorbent green spaces, wetlands, and porous landscapes to capture and filter stormwater, rather than channeling it away. Proponents, like landscape architect Kongjian Yu, argue that this method not only mitigates flood risk and replenishes groundwater but also creates valuable recreational areas. While promising, implementation in L.A. faces challenges, including high costs and bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

          <p>Despite being a symbolic battleground for immigration enforcement, California has seen fewer total arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) than Texas or Florida in the first five months of the Trump administration's second term. An analysis of federal data shows Texas led with over 26,000 arrests, while California had about 8,500. Experts attribute the disparity to California's 'sanctuary' policies, which limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE, forcing federal agents to conduct more visible and controversial street-level raids rather than making arrests through jails.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Officials Urge Porter Ranch and Granada Hills Residents to Stop Using Water Amid Outage</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles officials are pleading with thousands of residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to conserve water, including not flushing toilets, to aid repairs during a major service outage. The crisis began when a critical water control valve broke, disrupting service to 9,200 households during a heatwave and prompting a boil water advisory. Although some service has been restored, officials warn that continued water use is depleting pressure in the system's main tank, which could significantly delay the full restoration of safe, reliable water service.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is set to make his home debut, but his first weeks at the club have been overshadowed by significant off-field chaos. The Spanish champions have been embroiled in a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen over registration issues, which temporarily threatened the eligibility of new players. Additionally, major delays in the reconstruction of the Camp Nou stadium mean Rashford's debut will be at a small training ground venue, with uncertainty still surrounding when the team can return to their iconic home.</p>

          <p>Rachel Kettlewell, a former teacher, has turned her healthy jam startup, Fearne & Rosie, into the fastest-growing brand in its category in the UK. Launched in 2019, the brand focuses on low-sugar, high-fruit preserves and is now stocked in over 5,100 stores with a revenue forecast of £2 million. Kettlewell's success is rooted in a simple, obvious recipe that prioritizes natural ingredients, a stark contrast to the high-sugar content she observed in standard jams. The B-Corp certified business also donates 2% of its revenue to charitable causes.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece warns that the world is hurtling towards potential nuclear conflict as arms control treaties collapse and a new, more dangerous arms race accelerates. Russia's formal exit from the INF treaty and the massive buildup of nuclear-capable weapons by both NATO and Russia have made Europe a potential battleground again. The author notes a disturbing public silence compared to the mass protests of the 1980s, urging a renewed global movement to call a halt to the escalating madness and prevent planetary extinction.</p>

          <p>A BBC reporter has described the experience of going undercover to infiltrate a violent migrant-smuggling gang in northern France, a year-long investigation that has led to an arrest in the UK.
