          <p>Following a federal court ruling that deemed most of his tariffs illegal, President Trump asserted that the stock market requires these levies to thrive. While this claim is contentious among economists, the article notes an interesting side effect: U.S. Treasury yields have risen. Investors, concerned about a potential drop in government revenue without tariffs, are demanding higher returns for lending to a government already facing a fiscal deficit. This situation suggests that while equities may suffer, the bond market could see an unusual benefit from the trade protectionism policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's government is facing a significant political crisis, prompting the ruling Pheu Thai party to seek royal approval to dissolve parliament and call a new election. This move comes after the country's largest opposition group, the People's Party, backed a rival candidate for prime minister. The political chaos was triggered by the constitutional court's dismissal of former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra last week. The nation is now bracing for a potential power shift, with a parliamentary vote for a new leader possibly occurring as soon as Friday.</p>

          <p>England forward Lauren James revealed that public criticism and a painful injury diminished her enjoyment of the Lionesses' Euro 2025 victory. In an interview, James stated that fans were "too quick to judge" her performance, unaware she was playing through a significant injury that required her to be substituted in the semi-final and final. She also spoke about the fear of receiving racist abuse after missing a penalty in the quarter-final shootout, expressing relief that other teammates also missed. James is now recovering and hopes fans will be more mindful of players' unseen struggles.</p>

          <p>Incessant heavy rains have caused catastrophic flooding in the northern Indian state of Punjab, resulting in at least 30 deaths and impacting more than 354,000 residents. Authorities have declared all 23 districts as flood-hit, evacuating around 20,000 people to relief camps as major rivers swelled to dangerous levels. The state's chief minister described the event as the worst flood since 1988, highlighting extensive damage to approximately 148,000 hectares of agricultural land. This devastation raises serious concerns for the livelihoods of millions in a region known as India's "food basket."</p>

          <p>Despite some recent on-pitch success, Sheffield Wednesday is mired in a deepening financial crisis under the ownership of Dejphon Chansiri. The club is facing an English Football League investigation for late payments and has been unable to sign players permanently due to an embargo. Chansiri has reportedly turned down takeover bids worth up to £40 million, holding out for a valuation around £100 million, which financial experts deem unrealistic. In response, frustrated fans have organized boycotts to pressure Chansiri to sell, leaving the club's future in a state of limbo.</p>

After a grueling rehabilitation process where she had to relearn basic functions like walking and talking, she defied expectations by returning to elite sport.

These anxieties are compounded by rising U.S. Treasury yields following a court ruling against President Trump's trade tariffs, creating a mixed and cautious market environment.

Players like Stefanos Tsitsipas have engaged in tense post-match discussions over these tactics, which are not explicitly against the rules but are often seen as disrespectful.

The positive data comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates and sounded a more optimistic tone about the economy's resilience.

          <p>California lawmakers have passed legislation that mandates K-12 schools, state universities, and community colleges to issue alerts to families, students, and staff if immigration enforcement agents are present on campus. The bill, which now awaits the governor's signature, is a direct response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign that has created fear in immigrant communities. Proponents argue the measure is crucial for ensuring student safety and maintaining schools as secure learning environments. If signed into law, it would establish an early warning system similar to those for other campus emergencies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggles against teams with losing records persisted in a 9-7 defeat to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Despite rallying from an early four-run deficit, with Shohei Ohtani hitting his 100th home run as a Dodger, the team's bullpen faltered in the sixth inning. The loss highlighted ongoing issues with inconsistency that have prevented the Dodgers from solidifying their lead in the NL West. Manager Dave Roberts has suggested that with key players returning from injury, increased internal competition for playing time may be necessary to raise the team's intensity.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was accompanied by his teenage daughter, believed to be named Ju Ae, during a visit to Beijing, marking her first public appearance outside the country. She was seen with her father attending a major military parade hosted by China. This high-profile international debut has intensified speculation among North Korea experts that she is being groomed as his successor. Analysts note that she is gaining valuable diplomatic and protocol experience at a young age, positioning her as a potential future leader of the secretive, dynastic state.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is undergoing a "branding supercycle," where Chinese companies are increasingly competing on global trust and recognition, not just cost. The success of brands like Pop Mart's Labubu dolls is cited as an early indicator of a much broader trend. This shift is now extending into industrial sectors, with companies like electric vehicle battery maker CATL becoming household names. The article suggests that Chinese brands in areas like cars, drones, and biotech are building brand advantage, marking a significant evolution in the country's economic identity.</p>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra, California, successfully escaped a domestic violence situation by using a discreet hand signal that was observed by a bystander. While in a 7-Eleven with her alleged abuser, the woman used the "signal for help"—tucking her thumb into her palm and closing her fingers over it—which prompted the witness to call 911. Police responded quickly and arrested the suspect, who attempted to flee. The signal, created by the Canadian Women's Foundation in 2020 and popularized on social media, has been credited with aiding multiple rescues from gender-based violence.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a prominent Labour peer and former senior civil servant, has questioned the UK government's plan to restrict a Whitehall internship program exclusively to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Arguing from her own working-class background, Gray suggested that diversity of experience is beneficial and that she learned much from colleagues from different walks of life. The government contends the change will widen the talent pool and help the civil service better reflect the country. The debate highlights differing approaches to improving social mobility and meritocracy within public service.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has returned from its August recess to a chaotic legislative session with a government funding deadline looming on September 30. Lawmakers must navigate deep partisan divides to avert a shutdown, with Democrats and Republicans far apart on spending levels. In addition to the funding fight, the agenda includes contentious confirmation battles for President Trump's nominees, a push for a new crime bill, and continued political drama over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have co-authored an op-ed strongly condemning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In the article, they accuse Kennedy of "endangering every American's health" through his leadership, culminating in the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez. The former leaders, who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations, warn that Kennedy's actions have destabilized the nation's public health system and will make it harder for the CDC to protect Americans from health threats.</p>
