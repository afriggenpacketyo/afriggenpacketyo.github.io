        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Weather Service is planning to hire over 100 new employees after experiencing significant staff reductions earlier in the year. These previous cuts, which affected nearly 600 positions through layoffs and retirements, were part of broader government-wide austerity measures. The agency is now seeking to rebuild its workforce to maintain operational efficiency and provide accurate weather forecasting services to the public. This move signals a reversal of earlier budget-driven constraints and an acknowledgment of the importance of a fully staffed weather service. The agency aims to enhance its capabilities in predicting and responding to severe weather events, thereby safeguarding communities across the nation.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong performance in May with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posting gains, investors are showing skepticism about the U.S. stock market's strength, according to ETF flow data. Inflows into equity ETFs have more than halved since the start of the year, indicating a cautious stance driven by trade uncertainty and tariff concerns. Investors are primarily seeking refuge in ultra-short duration bonds, with ETFs like iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) attracting significant assets. While retail investors with a long-term focus continue to buy U.S. equities, the overall trend suggests a cautious approach, potentially signaling a "reset year" in the bull market cycle.

          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, met with White House officials to discuss the impact of tariffs on the sector. The meeting aimed to address the burdens tariffs place on the American fashion industry, which supports ten million jobs, and to explore balanced trade solutions. The industry representatives sought to convey the message that tariffs historically cause companies to raise prices on goods, ultimately affecting consumers. The discussion also touched on ways to maintain American jobs and preserve economic prosperity within the fashion sector, which has long faced high tariff rates compared to other parts of the economy.</p>

Rosen stated that the pardons suggest political violence is acceptable in a democratic society, which he finds unacceptable. He oversaw a team of attorneys handling the large number of criminal cases following the Capitol riot and highlighted the Justice Department's high conviction rate in January 6 trials. Rosen also criticized the demotion or firing of prosecutors involved in these cases after the Inauguration-Day pardons, viewing it as an affront to the department's independence.</p>

While the bill aims to reduce outlays by over $1.5 trillion, it is projected to add about $3.1 trillion to the debt, causing fiscal hawks like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson to push for deeper cuts. These senators are at odds with the White House, which claims the legislation will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years. The Senate is expected to modify the House-passed proposal, but any changes must be approved by the House, creating challenges for passage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A geomagnetic storm, initially forecast to produce vibrant displays of the Northern Lights across much of the United States, turned out to be weaker than anticipated. The anticipated streaks of colorful light, which typically result from solar activity interacting with Earth's atmosphere, did not materialize to the extent predicted. This outcome left many skywatchers disappointed, as they had hoped to witness the aurora borealis in regions where it is not commonly visible.

          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election experienced a low voter turnout, with nearly 90% of eligible voters abstaining from casting ballots. This marks one of the lowest turnouts in any federal election since Mexico transitioned to a democracy, raising concerns about the legitimacy and public support for the judicial reform process. The election aimed to allow citizens to directly elect judges, a move intended to increase transparency and accountability within the judicial system. However, the poor participation rate suggests a lack of public engagement or confidence in the electoral process, potentially undermining the mandate of the newly elected judges.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights a decline in childhood measles vaccination rates across the United States, with coverage varying significantly within states. Researchers found that the MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year across 33 states. The study reveals that 78% of the 2,066 counties examined experienced a decline in vaccination rates. This decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 96% of reported cases being unvaccinated or having unknown vaccination status. The study emphasizes the need for targeted vaccination strategies to address these disparities and prevent further outbreaks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for allegedly using law enforcement to target Congress, marking the second such incident in a month. An aide to Representative Jerry Nadler was detained by Department of Homeland Security police, sparking concerns about executive overreach. This follows a previous incident where Democrats attempting to inspect a DHS facility were arrested, with Representative LaMonica McIver later charged with assaulting federal agents. Critics argue that the administration is undermining Congress's independence and powers, while Congress has shown limited capacity to defend itself. The article raises questions about the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches.</p>

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing concerns about due process. The ruling states that the government has not provided adequate notice for individuals to challenge their deportation under the law. This decision adds to a complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, which the Trump administration has been using to deport people accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. Courts in other states have also issued rulings on the law, leading to differing conclusions. The Supreme Court has yet to rule definitively on the matter.</p>

The State Department spokesperson stated that the aim is to identify applicants with a history of anti-Semitic harassment and violence.

The Water Authority will now pay a fixed price to MWD for delivering water, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, with annual adjustments for inflation.
