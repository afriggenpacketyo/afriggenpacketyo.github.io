          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This rally is supported by growing institutional investment and anticipation of new U.S. crypto legislation aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the coming months, despite potential short-term volatility from international trade disputes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing forecasts, largely due to strong demand from non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. A temporary tariff truce with the U.S. also helped slow the decline in American-bound shipments, while imports saw their first increase of the year. This data highlights Chinese exporters' successful diversification efforts in response to U.S. trade policies, though the overall trade surplus widened significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of academic priorities is emerging in China, with students increasingly choosing to major in technology-focused engineering disciplines. Driven by the country's strategic push for technological self-sufficiency amid its rivalry with the United States, fields like information technology and vehicle engineering have become top choices. This marks a shift from two decades ago, when subjects like international trade were more popular, reflecting China's changing economic and geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have risen to the highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 people in 2024-25. In addition, a record number of penalty fare notices were issued on the London Overground network during the same period. TfL states that fare evasion costs the city vital investment and has expanded its enforcement teams to crack down on the issue, aiming to reduce the overall evasion rate.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump will make a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19. King Charles will host the president and first lady at Windsor Castle, an invitation delivered by Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier in the year. The visit, which is unprecedented for a U.S. president, is seen as a strategic move by the UK government to maintain close ties with the Trump administration, though it is expected to draw protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Washington, shortly after announcing a plan to sell weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Ukraine. The meeting comes as the Trump administration signals a shift in its approach to the conflict, with senators suggesting a major plan is in play to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities through U.S. arms sales. This follows the president's tease of a "major statement" on Russia and hints at leveraging seized Russian assets.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a "notably different" climate compared to just decades ago, with extreme weather events becoming the new normal, according to a new Met Office report. The country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency, driven by a warming rate of about 0.25°C per decade. The report highlights that the last decade was 1.24°C warmer than the 1961-1990 baseline, leading to more hot days, fewer frosts, and wetter winters, which in turn impacts nature and increases flood risk.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, long admired by international conservatives for his "illiberal democracy" model, is facing a significant political challenge at home. While his playbook of targeting liberal values and consolidating power has been effective for years, a new challenger from his own former circle, Peter Magyar, is gaining traction. Magyar is capitalizing on public frustration with the state of hospitals, schools, and the economy, creating a powerful counter-narrative that threatens Orban's long-standing rule.</p>

          <p>A decades-old water-sharing treaty between the U.S. and Mexico is under strain due to a severe, prolonged drought in northern Mexico and mounting water debt. Under the 1944 agreement, Mexico must send water from the Rio Grande to Texas, but it is currently in arrears, prompting the Trump administration to threaten tariffs and sanctions. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot give water they don't have, while Texan farmers contend Mexico is hoarding the resource, escalating tensions over the scarce supply.</p>
