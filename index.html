          <p>NPR has filed a lawsuit against the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), seeking to block a $57.9 million grant to a new consortium for operating the public radio satellite system. This legal action highlights growing tensions within public media, especially as federal funding for public broadcasting is set to cease. NPR, which has managed the satellite system for over four decades, alleges that CPB abruptly reversed an earlier agreement to extend its contract, bowing to pressure from the Trump administration. The network contends that CPB's decision threatens the stability of the public radio system and violates its constitutional free speech protections.</p>

The storm, which caused an estimated $60 billion in damages and destroyed over 74,000 homes, left many without basic services for weeks. Despite ongoing struggles, including a lack of permanent housing and damaged belongings, the family expresses gratitude for community support and donations received. Their story underscores the prolonged and arduous recovery process faced by many residents in the region.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, is championing an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the EU to enhance public finances before the autumn Budget. She argues that an exchange scheme for young workers would benefit the economy, growth, and businesses. While the UK and EU agreed to work on a "youth experience visa" in May, specifics are still under negotiation, with Reeves proposing time-limited, two-year visas for 18-30 year olds without a right to remain. The Chancellor also seeks the Office of Budget Responsibility to include the scheme's economic impact in its forecasts, potentially reducing the need for tax hikes or spending cuts.

          <p>Sweeping UN economic and military sanctions are poised for reimposition on Iran, a decade after their lifting under a landmark nuclear deal. This follows accusations from the UK, France, and Germany that Iran failed to uphold its commitments, triggering a 30-day diplomatic window that has now closed. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian denounced the move as "unfair, unjust, and illegal," insisting his country will not pursue nuclear weapons but requires assurances against attacks on its facilities. The renewed sanctions, which include an arms embargo and bans on uranium enrichment, escalate an already tense international situation.</p>

          <p>The USDA is alerting consumers about potential listeria contamination in ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's, linking it to a deadly outbreak previously tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals. The public health alert covers specific Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce at Walmart and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo. Although no illnesses have been reported for these specific products, the strain matches one that caused four deaths and sickened 20 others. Consumers are advised to discard affected meals for a full refund, as listeria infections can cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Brock Stewart will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, a significant blow to the team's bullpen, manager Dave Roberts announced. Stewart, acquired at the trade deadline, continued to experience soreness despite a minor-league rehab stint. The 33-year-old will have a debridement procedure, expected to allow him to pitch for most of next season. His absence leaves a hole in the bullpen, which has struggled this season, highlighting the risks associated with acquiring injured pitchers. The team will now rely on other relievers, including veteran Blake Treinen and rookies Edgardo Henriquez and Roki Sasaki, to navigate the postseason.</p>

          <p>A 79-year-old US citizen and car wash owner, Rafie Ollah Shouhed, has filed a $50 million claim against the Department of Homeland Security, alleging excessive force and civil rights violations by immigration agents. Surveillance footage reportedly shows agents body-slamming Shouhed during a raid at his business, despite his attempts to inform them his employees had legal documentation. Shouhed, who recently had heart surgery, claims agents ignored his requests for medical attention and detained him for 12 hours without charges, even after confirming his citizenship. His attorney asserts the agents' actions were unwarranted and part of a pattern of accusing dissenters of assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump stated he anticipates more criminal charges against individuals he considers political enemies, following the Justice Department's indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Trump explicitly named New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff as potential targets, reiterating his belief that they are "corrupt radical left Democrats." These remarks underscore fears that Trump's political appointees within the Justice Department may be emboldened to pursue cases against his critics, a concern heightened by the controversial nature of the Comey indictment. This signals a continued politicization of the justice system.</p>

          <p>A transcript reveals that U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala expressed confusion and surprise during the grand jury session for former FBI Director James Comey's indictment, particularly regarding two inconsistent versions of the document. Judge Vaala questioned interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump personal lawyer, about the discrepancies and the unusual late timing of the session. A majority of the grand jury voted against one of the three proposed counts, with only 14 of 23 jurors approving the two charges. This procedural irregularity and judicial questioning highlight concerns about the political motivations and handling of the unprecedented charges against Comey.</p>

Gemma Botting, whose husband Matt was diagnosed with the fatal neurodegenerative condition, described the breakthrough as "like winning the lottery 10 times over." The therapy, developed by uniQure, is expected to seek US licensing in early 2026, with potential UK approval by mid-2027. While challenges remain, including the need for full study publication and cost assessments, experts believe this approach could have broader implications for treating other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

This marks the first prosecution related to such tactics, following concerns from federal law enforcement about the "doxing" of agents amid protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies.

TV architect George Clarke notes that the King's advocacy for traditional, community-focused designs has become mainstream, moving away from "ego-driven" modern brutalism.

The pharmaceutical tariff includes an exemption for companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S. While experts suggest the pharma tariffs might have a modest impact due to generic exemptions and existing US production, concerns exist about rising healthcare costs. Trump argued these tariffs are for "National Security and other reasons" and to protect domestic industries, despite recent economic data showing tariffs are now contributing to inflation and job cuts in manufacturing.
