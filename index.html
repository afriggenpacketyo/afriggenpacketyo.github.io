          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Donald Trump at the White House to advocate for additional military support, including Tomahawk cruise missiles. Zelenskyy expressed hope that Trump could leverage his influence to bring an end to the nearly four-year-long war with Russia, drawing parallels to a recent ceasefire in the Middle East. Trump acknowledged the request for long-range weapons would be an "escalation" and expressed concerns about depleting U.S. stockpiles, especially after a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The leaders agreed to discuss the matter further, with Trump planning another meeting with Putin in Hungary.</p>

While stepping back further from public life, Prince Andrew reiterated his vigorous denial of the allegations made against him. The move marks a significant development in the ongoing efforts to manage the fallout from the controversy surrounding the prince.</p>

          <p>American electricity companies are struggling to forecast the actual power demand that will result from the boom in artificial intelligence, creating a multibillion-dollar infrastructure challenge. Tech companies are proposing massive data centers, some requiring the power of entire cities, but are often pitching the same projects to multiple utilities, making it difficult to gauge real need. This uncertainty raises concerns about over-investing in power generation and grid upgrades, which could lead to higher consumer electricity prices. While experts agree a historic increase in consumption is coming, the exact scale remains a critical question for the energy sector.</p>

          <p>The Swiss running shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit from customers who allege that its popular CloudTec shoe design has a defect causing an "embarrassing" squeaking sound with each step. The complaint, filed in an Oregon district court, claims the noise is caused by rubber components in the shoe's sole rubbing together. The plaintiffs argue they would not have purchased the premium-priced footwear, which retails for $140 to $180, had they known about the issue. The lawsuit seeks damages for what it claims are thousands of affected consumers who were unable to get refunds under the company's warranty.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut the federal funds rate at its upcoming October 29 meeting, there is a strong possibility that mortgage rates could fall even before the official announcement. Historical precedent shows that lenders often "price in" anticipated Fed cuts, leading to rate drops in the days or weeks prior to the meetings, as seen in September 2024 and September 2025. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should prepare by improving their credit scores and monitoring daily rate fluctuations to capitalize on a potential, albeit possibly temporary, window of opportunity.

          <p>A potential summit in Budapest between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump faces significant logistical challenges, primarily concerning Putin's travel through European Union airspace. Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russian aircraft have been banned from flying over EU and NATO member states, meaning Putin's presidential plane would require a special exemption. While Hungary has pledged to facilitate the visit, the flight path would need clearance from countries like Bulgaria or Romania, creating a delicate diplomatic situation. The complexities highlight the isolated position of Russia, even as discussions for a high-stakes meeting move forward.</p>

Alongside the lawsuit, Bonta announced a settlement with four other producers who will pay over $1.7 million and halt sales in the state.

The novel's main character, a surgeon who has lost her medical license, reflects themes of career setbacks and resilience.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to ask President Trump for more than just Tomahawk missiles; he is also seeking enhanced U.S. intelligence sharing to improve the effectiveness of strikes against Russia's vital energy sector. This strategy aims to cripple Moscow's main source of war funding and has already been aided by U.S. intelligence, reportedly enabling a nearly 20% reduction in Russia's gasoline production. Ukraine is also looking to upgrade its existing weapons systems, including its F-16s. This push for more sophisticated support comes as the Trump administration weighs the risks of escalation against the benefits of increasing pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive Russian air incursions into NATO airspace appear to have backfired, strengthening the alliance's resolve rather than dividing it. NATO has responded by establishing a more coordinated defense on its eastern flank, with member states like Poland and Estonia actively intercepting Russian aircraft and drones. This unified stance comes as European leaders and President Trump show rare alignment on the need to pressure Vladimir Putin, who may be feeling compelled to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. European nations are also increasing their own defense spending and exploring new economic sanctions to cripple Russia's war machine.</p>

          <p>A mother whose stillborn baby was discovered at a Hull funeral home nearly two years after his supposed cremation says she is struggling to forgive the man responsible. Jasmine Beverley's son, Sunny, was one of 35 bodies recovered from Legacy Independent Funeral Directors in March 2024; the family had been given a stranger's ashes after his 2022 funeral. Former undertaker Robert Bush has pleaded guilty to fraud in her case and three others, though he denies dozens of other charges. The discovery has caused immense distress for the family, who held a second funeral to finally lay their son to rest.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while President Donald Trump projects an image of a global peacemaker, his domestic policies are actively fomenting internal conflict. The article highlights the deployment of U.S. troops to Democrat-run cities, which critics see not as a crime-fighting measure but as a political intimidation tactic designed to provoke a reaction. This is viewed in the context of a broader effort to use the justice system against political opponents and purge the military and civil service of dissenting voices. The author warns that these actions risk escalating political divisions into a conflict resembling a second American civil war.</p>

Simultaneously, Chinese exporters are successfully redirecting goods to new markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, lessening the importance of the U.S. market.

While previous U.S. cases of clade I were linked to international travel, these new cases suggest the virus is now spreading locally.

          <p>Small businesses across the U.S. are facing severe financial pressure due to President Trump's tariffs, forcing many to take on high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations, small companies have less capacity to absorb the increased costs, diversify supply chains, or negotiate with vendors, making them particularly vulnerable. Economists view the struggles of these businesses as a "canary in the coal mine," warning that the negative impacts could soon spread to larger companies and the wider economy. Despite the administration's goal of boosting domestic manufacturing, many small business owners feel they are being unfairly burdened by the trade policies.</p>
