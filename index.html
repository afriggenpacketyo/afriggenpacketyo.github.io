          <p>Korean Air announced a deal to purchase 103 Boeing passenger jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models, following a meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and President Donald Trump. This agreement, unveiled during discussions on U.S. tariffs, is expected to modernize Korean Air's fleet as it merges with Asiana Airlines and supports approximately 135,000 jobs across the U.S. Boeing hailed the order as a landmark agreement, indicating that such deals have helped its sales surpass those of its European rival, Airbus. The purchase reflects broader efforts by trading partners to boost business with American firms.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's 10th Super Heavy-Starship test flight was scrubbed for a second consecutive day, this time due to adverse weather conditions, following an earlier ground system issue. This milestone mission is critical for testing corrective upgrades after three catastrophic failures this year and is essential for restoring confidence in the rocket's capabilities for future moon missions. While NASA's acting administrator remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to meet its goals, some experts express skepticism regarding the 2027 moon landing timeline due to the project's technical complexity and the unproven nature of large-scale cryogenic propellant transfers in orbit. The company aims to achieve a successful flight to advance its ambitious space exploration agenda.</p>

          <p>Wildfires, including the Pickett Fire in Northern California and the Flat Fire in Oregon, are threatening thousands of homes and vineyards across the Western U.S., exacerbated by hot, dry conditions. Napa Valley's Black Sears Winery owner, Chris Jambois, expressed deep concern over potential "smoke taint" on grapes, recalling how the 2020 Glass Fire ruined two vintages, making the wine taste like "licking an ashtray." The economic lifeblood of the region is at risk, and the frequent occurrence of these fires is forcing businesses like his to consider their future. Firefighters are working to contain the blazes, but the long-term impact on agriculture remains a significant worry.</p>

          <p>An American paramedic, John Rudat, was reportedly stabbed in the face by a Syrian asylum seeker in Dresden, Germany, after intervening to protect two women being harassed on a tram. Rudat sustained a significant facial wound from a six-inch blade, leading to a challenging physical, emotional, and financial recovery. Authorities arrested a suspect, who was later released due to insufficient evidence for the knife attack, prompting Rudat to criticize European immigration policies. The U.S. Embassy in Berlin condemned the attack and urged German authorities to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the first human case of New World Screwworm infestation in the U.S., detected in a patient who traveled from El Salvador. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the case, noting that the risk to U.S. public health is currently "very low." New World Screwworm myiasis is a parasitic infestation of fly larvae that feed on live tissue, typically affecting animals and causing serious damage. There is no medication to treat this painful condition, which is usually found in South America and the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, accusing her of "gross negligence" and "potentially criminal" actions related to mortgage documents. This dramatic move represents an early test of the president's authority to terminate Fed board members, who federal law states can only be removed "for cause" and serve 14-year terms. Cook had previously stated her intention not to be "bullied" into resigning from her position, setting the stage for a legal challenge. The decision has significant implications for the perceived independence of the central bank and its leadership structure.</p>

          <p>Recording artist Lil Nas X, identified as Montero Lamar Hill, pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting arrest in Los Angeles. The charges originate from an incident last week on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, where Hill allegedly charged at Los Angeles Police Department officers before being taken into custody. He was subsequently transported to a local hospital for a possible overdose. His bail was reduced to $75,000 due to his lack of prior convictions and low flight risk, with his father expressing his son's remorse and commitment to getting help.</p>

          <p>California Republicans have renewed their efforts to block Governor Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan, Proposition 50, from the November ballot, filing a 432-page lawsuit with the state Supreme Court. They argue the initiative, which would replace nonpartisan congressional districts with partisan lines favoring Democrats, violates the state constitution by presenting an "illegal, take-it-or-leave-it choice." Democrats framed the measure as retaliation against Texas's GOP-led redistricting, while legal experts suggest the argument against the ballot measure's single-issue compliance is weak. The legal battle highlights the tremendous power of voters to amend the California Constitution regarding electoral maps.</p>

It also highlights the psychological aspect of pain, noting that stress and work attitude significantly impact back health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food price inflation has surged to an 18-month high of 4.2%, primarily driven by increased costs for chocolate, butter, and eggs, according to the British Retail Consortium. This rise is attributed to high demand, tightening supply, increased labor costs, and poor cocoa harvests exacerbated by climate change. While some price relief is noted in clothing and stationery, consumers are facing higher household bills. The Office for National Statistics reported overall UK inflation at 3.8% in July, with food prices increasing by 37% over the past five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC study reveals that UK local authorities are selling off public assets, including schools and care homes, to address a spiraling £122 billion debt, equivalent to £1,700 per resident. Councils are increasingly granted powers to sell assets to fund day-to-day services, a practice critics argue erodes "public value." The Local Government Information Unit warns that the system is unsustainable, with many councils facing bankruptcy if funding remains unchanged. The government acknowledges the "broken" funding system and is pursuing reforms, but no debt write-off has been announced. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite U.S. warnings of an "imminent" threat by 2027, many Taiwanese citizens remain skeptical of an invasion, often preferring the existing "status quo" over unification or formal independence.
