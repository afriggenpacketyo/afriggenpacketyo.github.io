            <p>The US bond market experienced unusual volatility, with interest rates rising sharply and bond prices falling, signaling investor unease about the economy. This instability stems from uncertainty surrounding the impact of trade tariffs implemented by President Trump. The shift in investor sentiment could affect government budgets, public spending, and household borrowing costs, potentially slowing economic growth. Trump paused further tariffs on every country except China after the bond market's reaction.</p>

            <p>White House "Border Czar" Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's decision to remove Kilmer Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting he is a violent MS-13 gang member and a public safety threat. Homan dismissed the Supreme Court order to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return, claiming the administration lacks the authority. He criticized Senator Van Hollen's visit to Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of ignoring victims of MS-13 and border concerns, while Van Hollen emphasized due process and protecting fundamental freedoms.</p>

            <p>President Trump is reportedly studying options to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. Trump has criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates, stating his termination "cannot come fast enough." Powell's term ends in 2026, and legal experts question whether Trump has the authority to fire him. Kevin Warsh is being considered as a potential replacement, though he has advised allowing Powell to remain through the end of his term. (not investment advice)</p>

The new page also criticizes government officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, and questions the efficacy of social distancing and masking.

            <p>Surfers in Newport Beach were chased from the water by an aggressive sea lion, likely suffering from domoic acid poisoning. Domoic acid is a neurotoxin produced by harmful algal blooms that accumulates in fish, which are then eaten by marine mammals. Sea lions have a moderate survival rate when treated in a timely manner, but capturing them can be challenging due to their size. Domoic acid blooms are becoming more frequent and severe due to human activity and climate change.</p>

            <p>A US court order in the Abrego Garcia case strongly criticized the government's actions, asserting its right to detain residents in foreign prisons without due process. The court emphasized the importance of the rule of law and criticized the government's disregard for court orders. It referenced President Eisenhower's commitment to enforcing court decisions, urging the Executive Branch to respect the courts and uphold the Constitution. The court denied the government's motion for a stay pending appeal and a writ of mandamus.</p>
