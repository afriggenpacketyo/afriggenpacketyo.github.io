          <p>Moroccan authorities have detained dozens of young people during a third consecutive day of protests across several major cities, including the capital Rabat and Casablanca. These demonstrations, organized by youth networks like Moroccan Youth Voice and GenZ 212 through social media, are demanding urgent education and health reforms. Protesters are highlighting significant government spending on preparations for the 2030 Fifa World Cup while public health and education systems are perceived as neglected. Amidst high youth unemployment, particularly among graduates, and pervasive social inequalities, rights groups have condemned the police crackdown on free expression, with over 100 arrests reported over the weekend. The discontent underscores a deep frustration among Morocco's younger generation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article by Fatma Aydemir in The Guardian argues that Germany's current anti-diversity backlash is a deliberate strategy, not genuine fatigue, disguised as a return to neutrality. Following a period of increased focus on structural racism and gender quotas in cultural institutions post-Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, resources for diversity programs are now being cut. Marginalized voices are being pushed aside in favor of a "hollow neutrality." This shift, mirroring trends in the US and fueled by the far-right, is also supported by some self-proclaimed progressives who prioritize a subjective view of "quality" over inclusive representation. The article expresses concern that this movement risks losing truth and complexity in artistic and cultural reflections of society.</p>

          <p>Zijin Gold, the overseas gold-mining arm of China's partially state-owned Zijin Mining, experienced a remarkable surge of over 60% on its Hong Kong trading debut. The company successfully raised nearly 25 billion Hong Kong dollars, approximately $3.2 billion, through its initial public offering, making it the world's second-largest IPO this year. This strong market performance occurred at a favorable time, as gold prices have been reaching record highs amidst robust safe-haven demand, expectations of global interest rate cuts, and ongoing economic uncertainty. The successful listing further contributes to a notable resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has seen a substantial year-on-year increase in funds raised. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major Chinese grocery chains, including international players like Walmart and local giants like Alibaba Group Holding’s Freshippo, are strategically adopting tactics popularized by European discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Amidst prevailing economic uncertainty, these retailers are streamlining their sprawling hypermarkets, reducing clutter, and aggressively promoting their own "private label" brands. These store brands promise comparable quality at significantly lower prices by eliminating intermediaries and minimizing marketing costs, directly appealing to increasingly price-sensitive Chinese consumers. This shift reflects a growing demand for value-for-money offers in China's slowing economy, where sales at the top 100 operators were flat last year and store counts decreased.</p>

Meng, 60, has served as Shenzhen's party chief since 2022, having been moved to Guangdong that year. His appointment fills the vacancy created by the incumbent governor, Wang Weizhong, who was recently promoted to party chief of Inner Mongolia. These significant personnel changes were announced following the monthly Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping, which is a customary window for high-level provincial appointments and reshuffles within China's political structure.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting and subsequent fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Grand Blanc, Michigan, resulted in four fatalities and eight injuries during Sunday services. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle through the church doors and fired an assault rifle at approximately 100 congregants. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, with preliminary information suggesting the shooter harbored hatred for the Mormon faith. The community is mourning the victims, who ranged in age from 6 to 78, as federal and local authorities continue their extensive probe into the horrific event.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British military personnel are initiating legal action against the US industrial giant 3M, alleging that its combat earplugs caused life-changing hearing injuries, including tinnitus and deafness. Veterans claim the earplugs, issued for use during training and active service in areas like Afghanistan between 2003 and 2015, were defective and failed to provide adequate protection. This legal battle mirrors a 2023 settlement where 3M agreed to pay $6 billion to 240,000 US service members for similar claims, although the company did not admit liability. The lawsuit underscores a significant and widespread health issue among veterans, with hearing problems being considerably higher than in the general population.</p>

This conviction is the culmination of a seven-year international investigation into a global money laundering network.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a sweeping 100% tariff on all films not made in the United States, claiming the American movie-making business has been "stolen" by other countries. He asserted that this significant levy would "solve this long time, never ending problem," particularly benefiting California's film industry. This threat follows a recent wave of tariffs on branded drug imports and other goods. Industry experts, however, question the practicality and economic viability of such a tariff, noting that filmmakers often choose international locations due to more favorable tax incentives, and that such a policy could ultimately increase costs for consumers.

          <p>The US Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota over its sanctuary city immigration policies, making it the latest Democratic-led jurisdiction to face legal challenges from the Trump administration. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that Minnesota's refusal to cooperate with federal immigration authorities jeopardizes public safety by allegedly allowing "dangerous criminals" to circumvent legal processes. This legal action is part of the administration's broader, aggressive effort to crack down on what it terms "illegal immigration" and follows similar lawsuits initiated against other states and cities. A federal judge recently blocked the administration from cutting federal funding to some sanctuary jurisdictions, indicating ongoing legal battles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly suggested a criminal investigation into former FBI Director Christopher Wray, based on false claims from a conservative media outlet regarding FBI agents' involvement in the January 6th Capitol attack. Trump promoted the story, alleging that 274 FBI agents were secretly embedded in the crowd, potentially acting as "agitators." This call follows the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump publicly urged to prosecute. However, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General previously found no evidence that FBI informants encouraged illegal activity during the January 6th events, contradicting Trump's assertions.</p>

          <p>An opinion article proposes that Hong Kong could strategically serve as China's primary gateway to the United Nations, potentially establishing itself as a major UN secretariat hub in Asia. The author argues that leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive attributes—its official use of English, robust common law system, and extremely low corporate taxes—would align effectively with Beijing's vision of global governance. This initiative aims to empower countries that currently lack sufficient representation within the UN structure. The proposal seeks to strengthen Hong Kong's international engagements and facilitate China's significant role as a UN donor, by actively bringing the world to China rather than solely focusing on narrating China's story globally.</p>

          <p>The US government is on the brink of a shutdown as President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress concluded a White House meeting without reaching a deal. Republicans are advocating for a short-term extension of current spending levels, essentially deferring legislative decisions. In contrast, Democrats are demanding an end to Trump's unilateral spending cuts and a firm agreement to renew government health-insurance subsidies for low-income individuals, which expire soon. Both sides appear deeply entrenched in their positions, with Republicans believing they hold the political high ground and Democrats facing pressure from their base to resist. The standoff highlights a significant test of political wills, with unpredictable consequences for federal programs and services.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has imposed a nationwide shutdown of telecommunications, resulting in a "total internet blackout" across the country. This drastic measure follows weeks of severed fiber-optic internet connections and has severely disrupted mobile internet and satellite TV services. The Taliban have not provided an official reason for the shutdown, but it aligns with their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law since seizing power in 2021. The blackout has significantly impacted international news agencies, banking services, and even flight operations from Kabul airport, raising profound concerns among business leaders about its serious economic and social repercussions for the nation.</p>

Judge Royce Lamberth, in Washington, D.C., accused the administration of "concerning disrespect" for failing to comply with his previous orders to restore VOA programming to its statutory mandate. The proposed job cuts, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, were challenged by employees who argued they would severely hamper VOA's mission to serve as a reliable source of news globally. This ruling preserves the agency's staffing levels pending further litigation on the underlying motion to block the reduction in force.</p>

Medical regulations strictly mandate in-person consultations for Botox to prevent complications, which can range from drooping eyelids and headaches to, in rare cases, respiratory failure or even death.

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the planned deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland. Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield argue that President Trump lacks the constitutional authority to federalize the Guard for this purpose, asserting that local officials are fully capable of managing public safety without federal interference. Trump cited "war ravaged Portland" and threats from "Antifa" as justifications for the deployment, which the Pentagon confirmed is intended to protect federal property. Oregon's lawsuit, mirroring similar legal actions by California, highlights a growing conflict over federal intervention in local protests and state autonomy.</p>
