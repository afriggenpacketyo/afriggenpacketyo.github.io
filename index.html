          <p>Tesla announced a 12% rise in third-quarter revenue, marking a return to growth after two consecutive quarters of decline; however, its earnings per share fell short of analyst predictions. The company's net income saw a significant 37% decrease to $1.37 billion, a drop attributed to recent price cuts on its electric vehicles. Despite the mixed financial results, Tesla reiterated its long-term goals, aiming to begin volume production of its Cybercab, Semi trucks, and new Megapack energy storage system in 2026. The report also noted a continuing sales slump in Europe, influenced by increased competition and consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the entire East Wing will be demolished to accommodate President Trump's planned $200 million ballroom, a project more extensive than previously indicated. This development has drawn sharp criticism from figures like former first lady Hillary Clinton and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who raise concerns about the historical impact. The First Lady's office and other components have been relocated, and the White House Historical Association has documented the structure for archival purposes. The administration has defended the project as a necessary modernization, with the president stating the construction sounds are "music to my ears."</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a new directive that significantly restricts direct communication between Department of Defense officials and the U.S. Congress. According to a memo, nearly all interactions and correspondence must now receive formal approval through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs. The policy affects high-level offices, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and military department secretaries, with an exception for the independent Office of the Inspector General. The memo states that this measure is necessary to prevent unauthorized engagements from undermining the department's legislative priorities and objectives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With traditional savings accounts offering minimal returns, high-yield savings accounts remain an attractive option for savers, with many offering interest rates still above 4.20%. Despite the variable nature of these rates and the possibility of future cuts by the Federal Reserve, the potential earnings can be substantial compared to standard accounts. For example, a $10,000 deposit could earn over $400 in a year at a 4.30% APY. The article also suggests considering Certificates of Deposit (CDs) as an alternative, as they offer competitive fixed rates that protect savers from potential market downturns.

          <p>The San Francisco Giants have made a groundbreaking managerial decision, hiring Tony Vitello directly from the college baseball ranks, a first in MLB history. Vitello, who led the University of Tennessee to a College World Series championship in 2024, will take the helm without any prior major league experience as a player or coach. The move comes after the Giants parted ways with Bob Melvin following an 81-81 season. In a statement, the organization praised Vitello's leadership, competitiveness, and ability to develop players, expressing excitement for the new direction he will bring to the team.</p>

          <p>President Trump has filed two federal damage claims requesting approximately $230 million from the Justice Department to cover costs related to past investigations, including the Russia probe and the Mar-a-Lago documents case. This action raises significant conflict of interest concerns, as top DOJ officials who must approve any settlement, such as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, previously served as Trump's personal defense attorneys. While Trump has stated he would donate any potential settlement to charity, legal experts have questioned the basis for the large sum and highlighted the unprecedented nature of the request from a sitting president.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on American cattle ranchers to reduce their prices, asserting that his tariff policies are the primary reason for their recent financial success. His comments followed suggestions that the U.S. might purchase beef from Argentina to help lower domestic consumer costs, a proposal that drew criticism from agricultural groups and lawmakers like Senator Deb Fischer. Ranching industry representatives argue that high beef prices are due to a multi-decade low in cattle supply caused by drought and other factors. The president's remarks have intensified concerns among farmers already grappling with the effects of his administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Consumers may face higher turkey prices this Thanksgiving, as the USDA reports that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys have surged by 40% compared to last year. This significant increase is primarily attributed to a shrinking supply, caused by outbreaks of avian flu and a decade-long decline in the number of turkeys raised by farmers. Despite the wholesale spike, economists suggest that the price increase for consumers may be less severe, as retailers often use turkeys as "loss leaders" to attract shoppers. Several major retailers, including Walmart and Aldi, have already announced competitive deals on turkeys and holiday meals to appeal to budget-conscious customers.</p>

The changes, part of a Republican-led bill, are retroactive but have not yet been reflected in IRS withholding tables, leading many to overpay on their 2025 taxes. The study estimates this could result in an additional $50 billion in total taxpayer savings, although a disproportionate share of the benefits is expected to go to upper-income households.

          <h2>Recent Layoffs at AI Startups Signal Growing Volatility in Tech's Hottest Sector</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent wave of layoffs at AI startups, often following major investments or acquisitions by large tech companies like Meta and HP, suggests a volatile future for careers in the field. As big tech firms streamline operations, employees at the acquired startups are frequently the first to be let go to eliminate redundant roles. This trend marks a shift from past acquisition strategies that prioritized retaining startup culture and talent. The current employer-driven market and the rapid pace of AI development are contributing to this churn, potentially making it harder for startups to recruit talent seeking long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has formally demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi release government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The demand cites new revelations from the posthumously published memoir of abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre, which Garcia says contains horrific allegations against prominent leaders and contradicts claims that the files lacked justification for further investigation. Garcia accused the Justice Department of disregarding a congressional subpoena, raising serious questions about its motives as the committee continues its inquiry into the government's handling of the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Thames Valley Police have announced that no further action will be taken against four men who were arrested for projecting an image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle. The incident occurred in September during the president's state visit to the UK. The men were arrested on suspicion of offenses including malicious communications and public nuisance. The political campaign group Led By Donkeys claimed responsibility for the nine-minute projection, calling the arrests a "ridiculous overreaction" and an attempt to avoid embarrassing the president during his stay at the castle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, credit card borrowers face a choice between seeking immediate debt relief or waiting for potential rate reductions. However, experts suggest that the incremental nature of Fed cuts—likely totaling less than a full percentage point—will have a minimal impact on high credit card interest rates, which average around 21%. Given that interest continues to compound daily, waiting for market conditions to improve may be a costly strategy. Proactively exploring options like debt forgiveness, management programs, or consolidation could offer more substantial and timely financial relief for those with significant balances.

          <p>Alec Baldwin's lawsuit accusing New Mexico officials of malicious prosecution in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting has been moved from state to federal court. The move was initiated by the defendants, including the special prosecutor and district attorney, who cited the federal civil rights claims in Baldwin's suit. Baldwin filed the lawsuit after the involuntary manslaughter charge against him was abruptly dismissed during his trial last year, claiming he was made a celebrity scapegoat. This legal maneuver is the latest development in the protracted case following the 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.</p>

          <p>According to jewelry experts, the thieves who stole priceless treasures from the Louvre will likely struggle to profit from the heist. While the intact pieces are valued at over $100 million, their worth would plummet by as much as 90% if dismantled to sell the stones and metal separately on the black market. The unique characteristics of the centuries-old gems, including their distinctive cut and specific properties, make them easily identifiable to dealers. This high level of recognition within the close-knit world of precious stones means that fencing the stolen items, either whole or in parts, would be an extremely difficult and risky endeavor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates again in October, potential homebuyers are weighing whether to lock in a mortgage rate now or wait for a further drop. Locking a rate in the current low-6% range provides certainty and protects against unexpected market spikes, allowing for confident budgeting. However, waiting could lead to additional savings if rates fall as anticipated, though there is no guarantee of this outcome. Homebuyers should also consider potential "float down" fees that lenders may charge to unlock a rate and secure a lower one later, which could offset some of the benefits of waiting.

Despite the short-term decline, gold remains up over 50% for the year.
