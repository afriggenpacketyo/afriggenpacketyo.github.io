          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 07:06:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which may be the oldest comet ever observed. A team from Oxford University suggests it could be over seven billion years old, originating from a group of ancient stars in the Milky Way's "thick disk." This makes it potentially three billion years older than our own solar system, offering an unprecedented glimpse into a previously unobserved part of the galaxy. The object, currently near Jupiter's distance from Earth, is expected to become visible with amateur telescopes later this year as it approaches the sun.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prominent Russian election monitoring organization Golos has announced its dissolution after 25 years, citing intense pressure from state authorities. The decision follows the imprisonment of its co-chair, Grigory Melkonyants, for alleged cooperation with an "undesirable" foreign NGO, a charge Golos insists is politically motivated. Founded in 2000, the group was a key institution in post-Soviet Russia for documenting election fraud and advocating for voters' rights. Its closure is seen by observers as a significant blow to civil society and democratic processes within the country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $15 million in federal funding for research into PFAS "forever chemical" contamination in American agriculture. The studies were investigating how these toxic chemicals, often spread on cropland via sewage sludge fertilizer, move into crops, livestock, and water sources. Public health advocates and farmers, particularly in states like Maine where sludge has caused significant farm contamination, argue the research is critical for food safety. Critics have condemned the decision, stating it will hinder efforts to understand and mitigate a widespread and serious public health risk.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has established the "Make America Beautiful Again Commission" through an executive order aimed at restoring the nation's natural resources and outdoor heritage. The initiative seeks to address issues like the National Park System's $23 billion debt, poor forest management, and deteriorating water infrastructure by fostering bipartisan collaboration. The commission will bring together federal and state officials, private sector leaders, and tribal governments to develop a comprehensive strategy for long-term conservation success. Proponents argue this will depoliticize environmental issues and unite Americans around shared conservation goals.</p>

          <p>Following its recent conflict with Iran, Israel appears to be applying its long-standing Gaza strategy of "mowing the grass" on a regional scale. This approach involves periodic military action to degrade the capabilities of adversaries in multiple countries, including Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, rather than seeking decisive victory. While the strategy has proven popular domestically and has shown Israel's military superiority, it raises questions about long-term sustainability. Analysts note the high financial cost and the risk of perpetual, low-grade conflicts on multiple fronts, even as the war in Gaza continues.</p>

          <p>A recent study underscores the vital role scavengers, particularly vultures, play in maintaining public health by efficiently disposing of animal carcasses. The decline of vulture populations in India, caused by the livestock painkiller diclofenac, led to an estimated 100,000 additional human deaths annually from diseases like rabies, as feral dog populations boomed. Researchers warn that about one-third of all scavenger species are threatened, which could increase human exposure to pathogens from rotting carrion. The findings emphasize the interconnectedness of ecosystem stability and human well-being, showing how wildlife conservation directly impacts public health.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of contraction and raising concerns about its fragile state. The decline, driven by drops in manufacturing and construction, contrasts with strong growth in the first quarter, which was partly fueled by temporary factors like pre-tariff exports. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures "disappointing" but remained committed to stimulating growth. The data increases pressure on the government and makes an interest rate cut by the Bank of England more likely to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A hosepipe ban affecting over five million households has been enacted across Yorkshire and is likely to remain in place until winter, according to the head of Yorkshire Water. This is the first regional ban in the UK this year, prompted by the area's driest and warmest spring on record. The company stated the restrictions are necessary to protect water supplies amid forecasts of more dry weather. The move has drawn criticism from some customers, who point to the company's high rate of water loss due to leaks, which amounts to about 260 million liters daily.</p>

          <p>Sociological research indicates that Germany's corporate elite is largely self-perpetuating, with over 80% of top executives coming from the wealthiest three to four percent of the population. Sociologist Michael Hartmann's study reveals that social origin remains a more significant factor than merit, even when comparing individuals with identical academic qualifications. For instance, a PhD holder from an executive's family is 17 times more likely to reach a top board position than a working-class peer with the same degree. This lack of social mobility persists despite corporate diversity initiatives and is estimated to cost the German economy billions in lost GDP growth annually.</p>

          <p>The public's reaction to cosmetic procedures is often contradictory, celebrating "good" work while harshly criticizing "bad" or noticeable results, as seen in recent social media discussions about reality TV stars. This cultural dynamic creates a paradox where plastic surgery is increasingly normalized and seen as a status symbol, yet those whose results are deemed imperfect face ridicule. Critics argue this judgment is tied to beauty being an "ethical ideal," where "bad work" is seen as a moral failing that exposes the unnatural labor behind beauty standards. This feedback loop pressures women to pursue beauty but punishes them if the attempt is unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has postponed a vote to appoint three new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court due to a political impasse. The conservative CDU/CSU bloc requested a delay on the vote for one Social Democrat nominee, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, citing plagiarism concerns, though she was already viewed as too liberal by many conservatives. In response, the Green party called for the postponement of all three appointments, stating the move to single out one candidate was unacceptable and undermined the court's integrity.

          <p>A new study from the University of South Florida estimates that more than 700,000 people were victims of human trafficking in Florida last year. The report, commissioned by the state, breaks the number down into approximately 500,000 victims of labor trafficking and 200,000 victims of sex trafficking, of whom about 100,000 were children. Researchers attribute Florida's vulnerability to its large population, major event-hosting cities, and industries where exploitation is common. The report aims to make this "hidden crime" more visible to policymakers and law enforcement to improve anti-trafficking efforts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recently signed "big, beautiful bill" is a betrayal of his working-class supporters, contradicting his populist image. The author contends that the legislation's deep cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and clean energy initiatives, while adding trillions to the national debt, will severely harm the very people in his base. The piece highlights how Republican lawmakers, despite their own objections and the bill's unpopularity, ultimately voted for it out of fear of Trump's political retribution. The author likens Trump's actions to the parable of "The Snake," suggesting he has always signaled his intention to betray those who trust him.</p>

          <p>An investigation into Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, reveals a secret life of increasing isolation and fixation on violence. While outwardly a quiet, high-achieving student, Crooks spent the last year of his life practicing at a shooting range and using encrypted services to research explosives and the presidential campaign. His father noted signs of declining mental health, and investigators found he was able to build bombs in his bedroom. The report highlights security failures, as local police had noted Crooks as suspicious hours before the shooting but the information was not effectively relayed.</p>
