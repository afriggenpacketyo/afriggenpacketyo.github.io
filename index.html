            <p>An Alabama woman, Towana Looney, had a pig kidney removed after a record 130 days due to her body's rejection of the organ. Looney, who had been on dialysis since 2016, participated in the experimental transplant at NYU Langone Health. While the outcome wasn't ideal, the experience provided valuable insights for future research into xenotransplantation. Doctors decided removal was safer than trying to save the kidney, and Looney is now back on dialysis, but expressed gratitude for the experience and the break from dialysis it afforded her.

            <p>Luxury malls in Beijing and Shanghai are experiencing a slowdown in consumer spending, leading to rent reductions and changes in tenant mix. Shopping centers like Parkview Green and K11 are courting mid-market retailers to attract middle-class shoppers and address rising vacancy rates. Parkview Green is diversifying its restaurant offerings after losing high-end brands. Shanghai K11 is easing tenant criteria due to falling rental income.</p>

            <p>A growing obesity crisis in India has transformed the once-celebrated "pot belly" into a major health concern. India has the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults globally, with projections indicating a significant increase by 2050. Abdominal obesity is linked to chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies show South Asians, including Indians, tend to accumulate more body fat around the belly, increasing their risk of metabolic disorders.</p>
