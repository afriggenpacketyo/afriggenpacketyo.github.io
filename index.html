        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German Police Union (GdP) is warning that intensified border checks and asylum rejections cannot be sustained much longer due to staff shortages and suspended training. According to GdP chief Andreas Rosskopf, the measures rely on adjusted rosters, canceled leave, and paused training. Over 1,000 riot police officers are currently deployed at the borders after Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt tightened controls, resulting in nearly half of asylum seekers being turned back. The strain on resources is raising concerns about the long-term viability of the intensified border controls.</p>

The Prachand, Indiaâ€™s first domestically designed attack helicopter, is intended for air-to-ground roles and high-altitude deployment along the unresolved Himalayan border with China and Kashmir region dispute with Pakistan. However, Chinese media asserts the Z-10 has superior armor, maneuverability, and weaponry. The Prachand, equipped with a French cannon and missile hardpoints, is expected to be delivered between 2028 and 2033, while the Z-10 is already deployed in Tibet and Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion's earlier first-round victory, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race due to claims of Russian interference, made for a tense election. Dan secured 53.6% of the vote and promised to build Romania together, irrespective of voting preferences. Supporters celebrated Dan's victory as a win for a pro-European future and an honest Romania, while Simion initially insisted he had won before conceding defeat.</p>

Having spent much of his career in the US, UK, Europe, and Australia, Horton chose to work in China because he considers it a pro-environment superpower.

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed widespread child sexual assault in South Africa's illegal mines, with children being recruited for cheap labor and sexual exploitation. Miners describe witnessing the sexual assault of underage miners, some as young as 15, by adult miners in exchange for gold or as punishment. Mining researcher Makhotla Sefuli says criminal gangs specifically target children, often abducting them from neighboring countries and trafficking them with false promises of employment. The investigation follows a standoff between police and miners at the Buffelsfontein gold mine, which brought attention to the illegal mining industry and its exploitation of vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice because he receives ample amounts from supporters, amidst soaring rice prices affecting households. Eto's comments, made at a fundraising party, contrast with his ministry's efforts to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has doubled due to a poor harvest, and public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the situation is high. Eto has since expressed regret for his remarks and pledged to work towards resolving the issue.</p>

He warns that the U.S. risks becoming a diminished nation, selling only to domestic consumers and losing high-value industries to China, unless it invests in research, innovation, and global economic ties.</p>

          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, says his son changed after serving in Twentynine Palms. Richard Bartkus hasn't spoken to his 25-year-old son in over a decade and was unaware of his involvement in the bombing. Investigators believe Bartkus, who is now deceased, had anti-natalist beliefs and packed his car with explosives before driving to the clinic. The FBI is handling the investigation as an international act of terrorism and seeking public assistance to fill gaps in their timeline.</p>

This innovative method aims to inform habitat management, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing off riverbanks, to aid the voles' dispersal and survival.

Swim England failed to act on a 2012 investigation that recommended Rudd's suspension after hearing evidence from 17 witnesses.
