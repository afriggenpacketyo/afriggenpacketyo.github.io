          <h2>Millions in China Opt Out of Voluntary National Health Insurance Scheme</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 03:50:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of people in China chose to leave the voluntary national health insurance program for urban and rural residents last year, continuing a downward trend. The decline is attributed to rising premiums and stagnating incomes, which create a significant financial burden for many families, particularly in rural areas. This exodus is increasing pressure on the healthcare system, which is already facing challenges from a slowing economy and diminishing public trust. Experts note that without changes in economic conditions, this trend of decreasing participation is likely to persist.</p>

          <p>A Florida man, Michael Bernard Bell, is scheduled for execution for the 1993 shooting deaths of two individuals outside a bar. The killings were a case of mistaken identity during an attempted revenge plot for his brother's murder. Bell, who was armed with an AK-47, fired on the victims after mistaking their car for the one belonging to his brother's killer. He was later convicted of three other murders that occurred prior to this incident. Despite last-minute appeals citing new evidence, courts have upheld the conviction due to overwhelming evidence of his guilt.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose 100% tariffs on countries conducting business with Russia if a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. The president expressed significant frustration with Vladimir Putin, stating that diplomatic talks have not yielded results. This move signals a shift towards using secondary sanctions to pressure Russia into negotiations. The announcement was made alongside a new deal to sell weapons to NATO allies, who will in turn supply Ukraine, ensuring Kyiv can defend itself without direct U.S. payment.

          <p>A friend of Constance Marten has revealed that she spent four months as a teenage disciple at the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Nigeria, led by the late preacher TB Joshua. The church has since been the subject of a BBC investigation alleging widespread abuse and torture, including sexual assault and forced abortions. Marten's friend described the institution as a "place of torture," suggesting the experience may have contributed to Marten's later distrust of institutions. Messages from Marten years later show she was still processing the experience, which she described as a cult, and felt unable to discuss it with others.</p>

          <p>The Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, showcasing top talent but also highlighting persistent issues holding the tournament back. Morocco is emerging as a hub for women's football on the continent, hosting for the second consecutive time, yet the event suffers from last-minute scheduling and the use of smaller stadiums. Financial disputes, such as those affecting the South African team, and a significant pay gap compared to the men's tournament underscore the challenges. Despite these hurdles, the growing talent and on-field competition suggest this could be the most compelling WAFCON yet.</p>

Trump also affirmed his support for NATO's collective defense principle, a shift from his previous criticisms, and discussed his relationship with other world leaders and the UK.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has sparked controversy and speculation while leaving crucial details unknown. The report indicates that two fuel cut-off switches were moved to the "cut-off" position shortly after takeoff, causing the engines to lose power. While this has led some to suggest deliberate pilot action, aviation experts and pilot associations criticize the report for being selective and lacking a full cockpit voice recorder transcript. Key information, such as the context of the pilots' conversation and the engines' status before the switches were flipped, remains missing, making any firm conclusions premature.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with EVs accounting for over 93% of new car sales so far in 2025. This success is the result of long-standing government policies that combine significant tax exemptions and incentives for EVs with progressively higher taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. The country has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has made EVs a common sight, leading to cleaner air and quieter cities, demonstrating a successful model for other nations to follow.</p>

          <p>A district in Stockholm, Sweden, is being redeveloped into what is billed as the world's largest wooden city, with an investment of approximately $1.25 billion. The project in the Sickla area will use cross-laminated timber to construct thousands of new homes, offices, and schools, aiming to showcase a more sustainable model for urban development. The construction sector is a major source of global carbon emissions, and using mass timber can reduce a building's climate impact significantly compared to steel and concrete. The project reflects Sweden's deep cultural connection to its forests and a growing industry trend toward using wood as a primary building material.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China "soon," following assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. Sales of the H20 chip, which was specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls, were effectively halted in April when a new license requirement was imposed. The potential reversal follows intensive lobbying by Nvidia's CEO and a preliminary trade framework agreement between Washington and Beijing. This development is seen as a significant win for Nvidia, allowing it to reinforce its market leadership in the crucial Chinese AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Paraguay is one of only 12 countries that formally recognize Taiwan. The visit comes at a time of tense US-China relations, and analysts note that a potential summit between the US and Chinese presidents could influence whether the stopover proceeds as planned.</p>

          <p>Yields on Japanese government bonds have climbed to their highest levels in decades as political uncertainty fuels concerns about the nation's fiscal discipline. The benchmark 10-year bond yield reached a high not seen since 2008, driven by discussions of potential consumption tax cuts ahead of an upcoming election. With Japan already having one of the world's highest public debt-to-GDP ratios, investors are concerned that such fiscal expansion could lead to more debt issuance.

The lightning-caused fire, which had been managed for ecological benefit, shifted unexpectedly, consuming the main lodge and dozens of other structures. This is the second time the lodge has been destroyed by fire, with the first occurring in 1932, leaving many hopeful that it will once again be rebuilt.</p>

Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the driver assistance system failed to warn the driver or apply the brakes.

In a controlled experiment, female moths avoided laying their eggs on tomato plants that were making noises associated with distress, such as dehydration, suggesting they perceived the plants as unhealthy. While plants are not sentient, they produce these sounds through physical processes, which can be heard by many insects and some mammals. This discovery opens up a new field of study into a potential invisible ecosystem of sound-based communication between plants and animals.</p>
