          <p>Salesforce reported strong quarterly results and guidance, yet the market response was muted due to investor skepticism about the source of the improved outlook. Revenue rose 8% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share beat estimates, but the stock's initial jump was short-lived. Investors are cautious despite the progress in AI, particularly with Data Cloud and Agentforce, which have a combined annual recurring revenue of over $1 billion. The company also announced the acquisition of Informatica to strengthen its AI strategy, however, Salesforce is now seeing a benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar when the company was initially baking in foreign-exchange headwinds into its guidance.

His grandfather, born in 1790, served as president from 1841 to 1845. Tyler's immediate descendants lived into the modern age due to late second marriages to much younger wives. Harrison Ruffin Tyler co-founded ChemTreat, an industrial water treatment company, and was dedicated to preserving historical sites in Virginia.

          <p>A federal court blocked President Trump from imposing steep tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, finding that he overstepped his authority under federal law. The ruling, by the U.S. Court of International Trade, is a setback to Trump's trade agenda and could lead to a Supreme Court battle. The court found that the law does not authorize the president to use the emergency powers law to issue tariffs. The White House rebuked the court, stating that unfair trade relationships have "decimated American communities." The last sentence may not contain the word "score."</p>

Analysts suggest this surge is a hedge against political risk and fiscal policy concerns, rather than a belief that the government is nearing insolvency.
